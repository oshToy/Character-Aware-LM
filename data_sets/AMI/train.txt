yeah  
get that off the shelf  
i dunno what the word is in english  
well you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably  
i think  
or there maybe there shouldn't be any yeah i think should still be absorption  
is that why she's in a three person office  
televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the <unk> to the television to  
but yeah they'll all be different tiers like that  
let's give it a two  
yeah  
uh <unk>  
or they did look at the same thing and then they did or didn't brea you know  
because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it which suits everybody's taste  
so who wants to start  
yeah i mean basically we can make these things out of wood titanium plastic or rubber  
so  
basically  
they're gonna we're gonna have a lot of these  
uh  
yeah  
yeah i don't know  
teamwork  
um  
where  
yeah okay that's possible but it'll get very big the the remote control  
yeah  
yeah  
like this  
what are we going to uh uh make <unk> uh kind of functions in the remote  
there's just one chip  
'cause quite often people uh don't <unk> that they talk at the same time um interrupt each other  
but if there is anything you think we've missed out there then you know feel free to add it  
yeah  
yeah okay  
not everything  
no  
yeah  
yeah  
a ratty  
a space between she would like see  
it this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles  
yeah <unk> yeah  
but it should <unk> i think it should be a combination but teletext buttons are not uh in our design  
okay  
well colour i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons  
or alien or whatever he was  
that's fine  
uh they began with uh <unk> typical uh leather bags but then they became stylish  
yeah  
yeah alright  
yeah  
drop the squishy feel make it make it more breakable um or turn it yellow  
this is more risky because you're not following the trend you try to invent it  
because you can you can like build in a back forward button and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels  
you press it and your t. v. set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound and your uh remote controls then start to beep  
as opposed to just buttons  
yeah  
so first  
yeah then you don't have to email them  
a char chargeable  
uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff  
that'll yeah exactly  
so that he's proving that power is again maximum likelihood estimate of your l. p. parameters  
okay  
yeah yeah  
it's a bit hard to mark on this  
like um when you have  
yeah  
so i th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because i mean it it's tried and tested intra red  
i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume  
okay  
okay first criteria look and feel  
like you have the <unk> ones and you have the <unk> ones and then the <unk> protected so it doesn't actually get scratched  
yeah we pro i probably get four  
completely developed that side of it yet so we're not completely sure about that but yeah  
no it just uh it's a curve inside a thing  
mm-hmm  
mm  
but the current one you'd say would be fancy would be too  
i think i know what you might be getting at or or  
it also mentioned something called r. s. i. and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r. s. i. is because i don't know  
no i would have seen that one before  
so that is that only by type of file  
so he's supposing that the whole signal won't be able to to be captured by l. p. model and that the residue would be high enough or ho <unk> why he's comparing the <unk> to to the overall  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
just a scroll  
no  
<unk>  
oh it's probably just you 'cause you're the project manager  
uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting  
yeah  
it doesn't need ordered no  
is the project evaluated  
so that shouldn't be in  
um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product  
yeah  
we can delete but we don't do that  
yeah  
right right on it easy to see  
uh <unk>  
hmm  
there's a fancy look and feel  
so if if we use uh latex cases they won't allow us to use solar cells as an energy source that is the constraint  
um you know with minimal number of buttons  
components  
yeah well you have that kind of sort of  
well uh we made a prototype  
it's just the standard <unk> of work  
don't you think with a beam also you have less problems with the sheets  
yep  
covers  
yeah it depends on what kind of visitor you are exactly  
nothing is problem there  
yeah  
it one of the buttons is sticking i don't know  
huh  
and before my brain melts it but <unk> when when the <unk> running yeah it's i'll be in the lab  
yeah  
yeah  
uh a radio or a <unk> a video recorder uh v. c. r.  
mm  
no  
okay well done  
bright colour  
right um time for presentations then  
okay  
hello  
okay  
can i uh do my thing  
yeah there you go  
i have a meeting in five minutes so maybe we should hurry  
like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical ish kind of looking thing but i've no idea  
yeah  
i i didn't think so  
but um  
one  
um  
i would say six  
well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana  
um given  
yeah  
i thought that was good though because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
and sell the covers separately for example  
yeah yeah but or or an l. c. d. or an uh speech  
thank you  
record  
so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now  
um yeah i've seen that before too  
this is then the uh pear  
yeah  
something we're taught at university from a very young age  
alright and fashionable  
yeah  
okay  
okay that's not really a good  
so i would market this product it at eighty nine euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but i don't think we have that flexibility  
stick to the basics  
it's okay like samples or you can see root mean square energy or something  
yeah on this one  
um  
i think you have to cycle through  
or three hundred millisecond  
you just say channel fifty and that's it  
<unk>  
i mean it's not big things it's just maintenance at this program at this point and  
uh yeah i'd say so  
so to to uh  
they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button  
but that has to do with the size of it too  
uh <unk> these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes right  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
which means it's probably not  
very good presentation  
yeah  
that's the project manager's problem  
so  
well we kinda do yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah yeah  
if i look at what is the most expensive things uh it's the l. c. d. and the speaker  
good choice  
twelve fifty  
command interface  
and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach  
mm  
yeah  
but then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually  
yeah <unk> it just has to be <unk> when it's deliver out of the store it has to be just simple and plain  
team work was okay  
you know just to if you get frustrated <unk> remote control you can throw it kind of you know just uh you know um so  
it's my hobby  
so it has to be  
maybe uh  
yeah  
that's about here  
definitely  
yeah like the <unk> like a plotters or something yeah  
six with the power  
but uh as as the first step that's probably for for a prototype for next week that's probably not a bad thing i mean even if it's just that  
we also crossed out  
uh  
so oh sorry  
so this is the shape  
you know let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros sixty euros  
mm  
and uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the u. r. <unk> u. r. i. expert so that we can it's really a team working uh  
oh a bee  
and he takes the residual energy of <unk> full signal like <unk> <unk> gyro samples  
um the user interface i was since we can't use metal i was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic  
uh i think a lot of the time simon kirby has already said to me that anyone any of his students he wants to be on the first day  
or give a special edition uh with with  
the festival is <unk> already like it's one first you start with th  
but that's if you're using the covers  
so that would include battery source  
<unk> samsung something  
so the method  
mm yeah  
and the second thing some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls  
yeah but it's pretty fresh on the other side  
do  
yes but <unk> on the  
uh <unk> yeah press function and f. eight yeah  
it's it is really really uh really very very expensive though  
ah  
uh a fish  
i think that should be the same  
okay  
yeah  
this is  
yeah  
yeah but um component it is <unk> means it's an element actually in the model though  
um the simple versus the um the complex  
um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach  
unless you were trying to  
but this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also which isn't i mean  
and just be able to <unk> use them all from the same remote but not at the same time  
no no uh there's still there's still <unk> concept and something special left  
yeah we haven't got that much to talk about i don't think  
did i press function  
mm we i i know something we need more cakes more biscuits on the table while we have meetings  
true  
it's special pen  
does it sort of look fancy rather than functional  
<unk>  
well the button button over here or whatever i don't know  
you you can <unk> here  
i think it's all about following apple's lead on a lot of these things  
uh well now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools  
i think so too  
yeah which david did yeah  
that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark you can um still see the remote control  
yeah  
remote control is lost i mean when it has speech recognition then  
spongy  
big buttons positive  
so this kind of feature extraction because basically that's what it is saying yes no this channel is good  
as long as she admits it then then that's fine  
okay  
um i think an apple would be a good <unk> shape  
sorry  
that'd be different  
yeah then you might get uh better direction in elevation  
yes  
yep  
it would have to be a bit bigger  
so uh  
i see  
yeah yeah yeah  
uh yeah sound and then within sound i guess treble and bass  
but but we need good communication about this stuff 'cause i have to <unk> put the components into the design  
is this me being like guys do you like me  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah so the initially i thought it was sort of more a search functionality um that simply there's one button that says find similar segments  
yeah  
right  
um the l. e. d. and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap  
well  
we also need to maybe get the slogan in here um it's i'm pointing at my laptop what in god  
with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff favourite channels and and with a cradle and yeah and the locator  
yes  
bad religion  
okay do <unk> do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it  
that's fine  
okay  
the only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports l. c. d.  
we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change i guess i mean people want a remote that's familiar  
uh <unk> how you call it  
i wanna see the output files from these um from the digital paper  
so <unk> when you uh when you actually generate your results  
mm-hmm  
i received uh a spreadsheet  
hmm  
have we implemented new technology  
okay  
i dunno what i just did  
uh would appear to be essential  
something like where are you and then it will sing i'm here  
so  
yeah no i i think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting  
and if you click on uh plus button you can expand it and see the key frames that are in fact uh five extracted frames from the shot  
it's time to close this meeting  
yeah  
no  
yeah  
okay so look and feel  
um the second thing um  
okay  
right that's not shouldn't go in  
missed false starts um missed <unk>  
we're getting paid  
on on the off line yeah  
yeah could be  
oh  
yeah i don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a  
so uh  
so and then he <unk> gives some kind of in terms of this residual letter  
yeah  
did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to  
maybe like rewind and wind or <unk> what <unk> what do you guys think  
mm  
yeah  
something sort of sort of <unk> slightly sort of <unk> in form  
even design  
yeah  
it's not double  
my name my job okay  
do we have to do other things  
so if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology  
we're just saying volume  
mm  
should we have audio  
uh  
so maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then  
um we are so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time  
yeah unnecessary  
um  
okay so uh next presentation  
um  
so how how did you like the conference anyway  
okay  
the l. c. d. can display what is that on that and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here or in the button th here  
yes  
oh okay  
well uh it <unk> <unk> <unk> ellen's away  
and you can leave it just there  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
lunch  
yeah i think that's quite okay  
three it's okay  
like having to uh <unk> it's  
yeah but you can <unk>  
if we're  
mm-hmm  
i think our uh users will really uh will really like that  
hmm  
um  
um but ooh where's it go  
yeah yeah yeah right  
and it it doesn't have to be strong also  
and they show that there's a very less correlation or in fact no correlation kind of thing  
yeah the volume ones should stand out a bit  
what is it  
i don't seem to get them anymore  
yeah  
by the way we also have this one  
yeah  
um and i hadn't thought of it as being a <unk> thing  
you're all get you're all getting a raise  
'cause they i mean we <unk> we got all this in the ascii format at the moment and it's just a matter of what data do we need to pull out of that into the g. d. f. so i can actually do the proper analysis  
that my method was to look at the well my my inspirations  
the eleventh  
yeah i've been able to run it without yeah  
so <unk> <unk> having seven buttons instead of twelve  
mm 'kay  
mm-hmm  
no marius is also using like hilbert transform and then  
so which one are we talking to  
mm  
right okay so  
<unk> <unk>  
we don't care  
yeah  
yeah  
keep the navigation but  
um and um i'll be taking minutes on this one and um being hooked up to the <unk> for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself  
okay  
so there in the there is i think two point four kilo bits per second the bit rate for that  
next to the control on the left  
um for instance ninety one percent of <unk> of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes they want these features  
something  
okay  
inspired  
uh door is closed  
i am the industrial designer  
cool  
uh yeah that's what my web site said i  
so  
wherever it is it'll beep so we we can probably come to know where it is  
i don't know  
yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit  
yeah but also which buttons you have to press to get a certain result  
doing pretty well so far aren't we  
good  
no raid one is having exactly <unk> fifty percent capacity is <unk>  
and we can make craig shift all his other priorities to do this 'cause we bought him  
mm-hmm  
though we didn't actually i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building  
'kay  
eighteen  
mm-hmm  
it is actually something in the absorption that you're seeing  
hmm  
yeah i just wanted to uh um why do you think it's necessary at all to do that  
use <unk>  
it's a kind of uh speaking styles  
without  
you can consult them at your leisure  
uh  
okay this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote  
the n. as well  
yeah there suddenly they come  
uh latex  
the problem is was that it was not synchronized  
mm-hmm  
'cause this is the building blocks i guess yeah  
i'd probably go with three again for that one  
okay  
<unk>  
yeah programming  
is it really weight  
yeah  
then i think it <unk> it should stay in in this case even though it's modified by activity or it's it's <unk> modifying activity actually  
i think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months  
yeah  
mm  
this concerns these following words and then just make make a simple mean over them  
mm-hmm  
um yeah i was just go on  
yeah probably but but uh yeah that's that's that shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue  
uh we have assembled our prototype um  
uh right that's what we did  
it's a bit  
mm-hmm  
oh wait  
yeah  
mm  
right  
okay so you stayed at the at the same coast not not you didn't go to the island  
do we have an uh example of a good one  
oh but it's so tactile to have the little metal bits  
so the average is about a two  
no no no  
l. c. d. on the remote just telling you what's on or uh interactive l. c. d. or  
yeah it's better  
when you log into m. m. m. as with a c. c. s. s. h. for instance um so you just put it's working like this m. m. m. data  
yeah  
uh um  
we didn't want it any more than that  
yeah  
no you're not connected to me anymore  
manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this i'm afraid  
yeah  
and the goal would be that indeed we could start uh rec doing some of the recordings of the time so that indeed we would already we uh we would have uh something where uh we could uh start getting the data  
th this one was  
or  
so if you have all the lights off in your living room you'll you'll temporarily see it  
to come up with a concept of it want what we want it to look like  
yeah okay true true true true  
yeah <unk> but  
i'm not sure  
yeah i don't think it would  
there you are okay  
that that would solve the problem  
you should be thinking about the high level goal in order to focus the work that you're doing rather than thinking well  
a little bit over six  
yeah  
it should be on your desktop so on the yeah  
yeah  
and uh so what we did with alessandro is uh um <unk> <unk> uh performing some statistical tests to see whatever <unk> if the if the words uh the the appearance of the words during the meeting is uh in independent of the <unk> appearances of the different slides  
indeed  
but i suppose if you just did it globally treating a meeting as a document  
i  
i think maybe in terms of marketing is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost  
uh i'll <unk> i'll try the good old google and see if there is uh if there are some sort of ranking sites or whatever  
but it's not a one  
so maybe well but then well no if somebody like nist will have one <unk> and you just plug a different feature but uh it's dangerous  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we'll stay here  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so so they need no technical experience to operate  
because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and <unk> and control your television from your armchair  
i mean i've i've already i've already got this yeah  
right right  
below  
yeah <unk> but but then you can nah i don't thin i think that it would be more expensive  
but boy we can sell this thing because there's no batteries it's environmentally sensitive i we can identify it as a safer product in some form  
yeah interchangeable plates  
mm  
<unk>  
yeah  
i thin yeah i mean where else should you put it  
mm-hmm  
mm mm  
okay  
like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has the weight for the other  
yeah sure  
we have to sell uh a lot of uh  
i'm gonna pull this off  
no wait  
you can add very <unk> much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode  
mm-hmm  
petr <unk> is working mainly on speech coding  
uh back to black  
yes  
i mean uh here the scheme is for exchange scheme  
so  
yes  
this is an uh sort of old technique which uh it  
okay  
ooh  
an interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room  
if it's sensible  
uh the one on the left  
okay  
and uh i found that it doesn't matter so much which what is the phase because we are using just one second window right  
is that what you mean  
no  
because it's it's the volume i it's you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response so  
change channel to eight  
if people are buying remotes then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most <unk> come with remotes so  
um but a <unk> a pen with a camera on it i don't think it's such a new thing  
electronic simple chip on print and we'll need one of those  
cheers  
<unk>  
'cause  
me ah yeah  
we got rid of  
that's for the l. c. d. or for the titanium  
yeah  
right  
but do you really really need it or like voiced <unk>  
uh we yes <unk> i've lo i've done the role that i was asked to do anyway  
even from my perspective seven <unk> seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still  
alright  
innovative in generally or just <unk> original for  
okay  
uh  
so what they want  
okay  
hmm  
uh yeah  
with each other  
i'll go first  
yes exactly  
but i don't think it will be very hard  
uh create this product and um discuss  
um okay then we'll move on to the case  
mm  
yeah but it's under or equal  
well i guess there's telescopes but that that's that's different though isn't it  
it's it's quite strange  
aren't we forgetting something very important  
yeah  
yeah  
you wouldn't prob you wouldn't want it in this kind of format for up translation to the other things  
and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side  
yeah  
yeah otherwise you'll you'll definitely see me in m. s. n.  
so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of <unk> thing is i have to integrate that in the design  
black  
so you mean relatively short turns and speaker change  
i i give it a two  
mm-hmm  
we also meet the other thin <unk> you <unk> you just re we have to choose for the the simple design i guess  
and that's it  
because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market  
huh  
um we're supposed to develop a new remote control that's both original trendy and user friendly  
adjusting  
as to a the costs involved  
it would look like a banana just sitting on their table  
uh the appearance of the uh r. c. is is important when they are buying one but  
yeah  
so i mean  
energy source um which in our case will <unk> oh well okay never mind  
oh  
and that gives us quite a lot of values  
whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium  
so i come up with a simple design just keep the <unk> navigation buttons  
two questions  
that's fine  
uh not something i i've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting i thought maybe a casing option like uh  
yes  
oh yeah that's difficult  
this is interesting 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important  
no the scroll wheel required the regular so the  
select  
um  
and if we want to get the market we really need that  
so this is tandem  
oh we skip this i guess  
yeah  
yeah  
okay i'll stay in here  
because um i it's not supported for instance uh uh in java in java applications uh etcetera  
as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light  
oh  
i don't think  
so this was that face to face meeting  
there it is yeah  
mm mm probably not yeah  
channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple  
you've  
right  
it it should be a cat  
let's cut to the chase  
now we know <unk>  
or  
yeah it's easy  
th you can just check <unk> and then voices  
you or me  
so they <unk> all work actually function together but i have different remote controls for each of them  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yep  
well  
he's the whatever  
i know if we do have a double curved case it can't have any titanium in it  
yeah  
little lights  
um  
uh i personally uh <unk> prefer that uh it would be <unk> uh come available in the various colours and uh easy to use buttons  
yeah  
over  
the speech  
i guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero which is nice  
and you know yeah you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah  
on the other hand if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh  
and the last one i would like just mention just to for the meeting and this is uh the fire wire  
anything  
okay we have now to <unk> uh to calculate the production cost  
yeah yeah that's right  
yeah then it's twelve euro fifty then it's okay  
or we can do something like that  
i <unk> yeah but that's why uh we no we'll only be working as i say with sort of solid obvious <unk> and as parts  
method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to  
who just have or already have a job and have the money but  
oh  
and we will have uh a square shape like this that will be here and a second one that would be there  
above that  
so we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of  
yep  
you just <unk> you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up  
because actually i mean they're all still re young people  
maybe it's easier to to sell it but  
mm  
<unk> hmm  
what is the other chip for  
oh sorry  
so what i found out that uh as i said uh i think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh <unk> uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control  
like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the <unk> and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that  
but it look  
on the back or  
i think one factor would be production cost  
yeah  
mm  
triangles are good  
well i suppose uh i suppose they can capture things right  
yeah  
yeah  
i think that's the best uh way to do it  
hmm  
like it  
yeah  
so that was too bad con was impossible here anyways  
and it is a growing trend the higher technological like  
and  
okay so how do we do it  
uh okay  
can we market this as the mango remote  
and <unk> maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to  
yeah  
so when you <unk> you sit like this you can can watch  
yeah i know uh  
that doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off  
right  
it is possible but you can't use double uh curves for titanium  
um  
no no  
<unk> well well we've um in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t. v. so that's what we should do for now i think  
okay so mm so well done for the presentations  
it's done by hardware  
thank you  
okay  
a lot of things to consider  
so  
mm-hmm  
no  
so i'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over  
right  
so  
okay so you your job in this is to um ensure that it actually is a bug and then pass it to joe  
so maybe we can have a look at the criteria  
well  
all t. v. <unk> so  
well what what what i what i agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle  
okay  
okay yeah  
and i guess it's currently working  
i if it was <unk> as in different languages and stuff that does open it is supposed to be international right  
that makes uh seventeen  
hmm  
yeah low <unk> q. s. o. <unk> no  
no you you we should be able to get it at i don't think it was i don't think it was a gigabyte  
i was a i was also very uh unhappy uh very unsatisfied uh about the  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
exactly  
whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year  
okay we can we can hide those under a menu or something okay  
mm-hmm  
and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages  
you're finished  
okay  
yeah  
<unk> uh slightly smaller  
i mean it it works it works well  
cause i'm just saying there's a heaps of there heaps of options  
something uh  
but solar  
mm-hmm  
um  
well <unk> as long as we know that issue is  
<unk> okay  
yeah <unk> we need very primary colours like bright red bright yellow  
<unk> what do you suggest i mean we do  
including the <unk> the multi coloured wave pattern  
oh  
the very broad overview is original trendy and user friendly  
i don't know what real purpose of uh these little folded up a. four fliers  
right  
were  
in the first place you know  
um i always store the beg uh start and end time of everything i calculated there so i would just have to <unk> put it uh yes  
but still i mean even if it's done on the card you need to basic thing you need to check is um is a bus right  
yes  
uh  
it has to be durable it has to a and i think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap  
yeah  
uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source  
it it's  
teletext um now i'm not too clear on what that is  
the sound from the television because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh you know  
i think i think it's maybe an interesting test scenario and we know that you're sort of basing something around speech and and text  
so if you take a look on that spectrum of that of that carrier signal  
i agree  
so when you say i want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty  
and you can have many colours on weekends  
so this shows if we see anything at all then we see at the moment at least that we are definitely be um having a different summary  
like what i bet that's a <unk> made swing component that little slider and all you do is add it to a panel  
yeah  
no you can click it on your television  
mm-hmm  
um  
and at the backside of remote just just just a little hole  
okay  
yeah  
oh yeah burning it on a like we should be able to burn the whole corpus just the x. hmm  
uh okay what else  
welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh  
confusing yeah  
so we're just managing it really  
i haven't really found a conclusion like that  
okay let's see  
yeah  
internet and here is my  
no  
like what what are ideas to combat these problems  
so will it be for example uh <unk> uh solar energy <unk> or will it be a battery like the classical battery so  
but it's just a logistic thing with personnel where where we ha that was the minimum we were able to offer a contract for  
and the list of them that occurred  
yeah <unk>  
i mainly focused on the l. c. d. uh aspect  
yeah i think over here the logo  
yellow case and grey buttons i think  
and after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts so  
be bold and innovative and hope this works and well hope that it works  
okay  
and then to detect uh the the the the changes we we do a calculation um with points under this sliding window within this sliding window  
hmm  
transmitter  
alright  
oh that's true we could lose the <unk> yeah i forgot that sorry  
but the actual stuff it's doing will be on line  
it would be a small transmitter um watch battery type scenario i would say  
no after d. c. t. you are trying this is so kind of again a real trajectory right  
eight  
decided  
and so we have to um come up with a way to to create a a uh remote control where um  
but um well does it have that  
and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this  
twenty two  
it doesn't look like that  
maybe some uh asian countries  
on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control so keep that in mind  
yeah then we can  
and then a second  
well i it's cool guys  
the the angle you have to use  
curved and one side flat and they can be curved with on both the sides  
so  
okay we'll we'll come to that later  
so i mean you know i guess you could build that in  
sorry  
yeah  
i don't know why but a cat is a very uh smart animal  
yeah <unk> of course we're gonna use  
it must  
we <unk> we could also that was a would also be an idea but i don't think it i don't know if it exists already  
uh he's he's done his and got his and yes  
um green  
um so i was quite pleased with that  
uh-huh  
and then it stand the test of time better  
yeah  
it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button channel button and of course of also the on and off button  
uh you use the battery and <unk> charge it up with kinetic  
i see what you mean  
yeah it's true  
so  
so now um last time  
so it's good  
but  
'kay  
that's my contribution  
well we we we used our creativity but we just had to adapt it to the costs  
what is most robust for a speech recognition and and leave out anything so you're well geared towards this task  
mm-hmm  
looks like yeah kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the r. <unk> in um mm-hmm  
yes no maybe  
yeah  
yeah  
of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device  
yeah  
i think we really got into it i mean i got into it as the day went on and i got really like  
you mean  
uh six the marketing research started on <unk> on the age of sixteen  
okay carry on  
yes  
um  
yeah  
sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but  
well i don't mind running it  
mm  
you have other thing to add to this point or uh no  
the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy  
uh  
uh-huh okay okay  
so you can't use it  
no  
and we don't know so there's every chance of this falling over again if it's a hardware thing right  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
i don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh  
okay  
uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way  
okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width etcetera etcetera  
uh but as it is not really important i can regenerate that  
no  
yeah  
yeah but so you say that <unk> like you basically say <unk> having an array where each each cell is is one like is <unk> is one word  
no no  
do i just put quantity being one battery or  
how do you configure that  
yeah maybe because  
okay cool  
um latex double curved curved  
so uh  
well very good  
it's stated both in  
uh i'm not sure what marketing thinks about it but  
yeah  
so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint  
mm-hmm  
and you yeah and  
well it's interesting that they  
first years  
it was uh it nineteen eighty three boston  
no no no  
so it's it's not  
and uh by making it multi purpose it uh has a new feature adds a new feature to the market and distinguish from uh from current products  
which is uh very very standard and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button  
to <unk> them  
and this could be done by through internet  
those kinds of fashion trends  
i give it a one  
keeps coming off  
do a search for yeah find replace for open parentheses and that'll take you to any that it any that the first transcriber might have marked out  
worries queries  
like if we those a special information density i. d. or if you just put a <unk> yeah something like that  
okay  
yeah  
yeah searching for channels programming them  
yeah i think it's not <unk> <unk>  
and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra red  
um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use  
i do not know  
um i would call uh choose two 'cause we decided not to make two <unk> uh fresh colours as it would not  
yep  
so that's the point  
r. three  
<unk> hmm  
a two  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
how  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
so this this is what p. l. s. a. gives you to start with and then you <unk> this and it becomes something else  
designing a remote control  
yeah  
okay yeah  
mm-hmm  
so i think it's uh very uh very nice  
uh one one set  
so after the technological aspect  
uh i i th i think it probably is fair i'm just i i've gotten um uncomfortable with it  
uh i can't add  
yeah  
according to my sources uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh titanium is available  
but uh that was not uh well picked up in the ami corpus which is supposed to be  
we we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components  
that we would would wanna pick out  
<unk> i haven't replied to him about um  
these buttons  
mm  
there's there's then two triangle isn't there  
um for the cache uh  
not too much no  
i can't draw so  
right um sorry this is pink because i was copying and pasting the table and i didn't have time to white it out again  
huh  
that wasn't very clear  
yeah  
no  
yeah it's natural and i  
of working design  
you know i think the the company's <unk> next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately  
'cause i don't think we can  
well not yeah  
so that's one euro  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
i think we should filter them  
yeah  
and so think of this concept  
hey  
but it's this doesn't sound very nice and we were playing at the uh summer school with them actually with the authors  
it's just the why they <unk> why they get new parts that's the problem for us  
yeah  
um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks because it's gonna be flat on one side  
so the plus and then yeah  
so you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips  
yep  
yeah  
it's mango  
so i think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look i think that's definitely important  
yeah  
mm  
uh yeah  
about a two  
and i think uh those things we can use  
okay now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay  
i feel watched  
mm-hmm  
so we went through th uh <unk> we took this following decisions  
and then you would be likely to say that p. l. s. a. might be better over that because you don't have enough links  
in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh <unk> first prototype  
i think <unk> but the the vocal command is easy too  
yeah  
i don't think it's wireless here  
yeah  
was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to <unk> absolutely <unk> who we're gonna aim this at and what exactly the product's gonna do  
well from the mouse idea you could remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press  
yeah  
or yeah  
yes  
one  
you know it  
i'm just thinking for this whole thing of like a different level sort of cutting out different different pieces  
it's uh it's the the pen is more intuitive 'cause we're all used to writing with pen  
no that sounds good  
so we can use them  
oops  
what  
shall we have a mute button as well  
now i think we got  
that would mean we'd have to make a television as well  
yes perhaps yeah but i mean they're all very very similar all those x. m. l. files  
could you copy it  
um we decided our remote uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want  
hmm  
oh i wasn't expecting a prototype i just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet  
continue with my pres presentation  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so that 'cause i have to do an average  
so how many sessions you attended  
well what are the options  
i like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh  
but yeah  
the <unk> yeah i was i was thinking about th the <unk> do we still want a joystick idea  
for us we need to have uh this sufficient resolution images of slides to do what we want to do  
thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket okay  
what when when you look at it in the hmm  
the buttons i  
i don't know  
okay  
it's uh well he said to me well uh  
i um solid feel and trendy look  
you're gonna send that pan pen crazy  
what exactly are you computing  
uh due to some uh technical problems i haven't uh <unk> the last uh the meeting minutes  
and so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much  
yeah <unk>  
come on if we if we if we make this fifty million they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us so uh  
so  
but even without it  
oh yeah  
then um the audio video card um so so uh first uh we need to look at this  
it won't  
okay  
but anyway  
yeah  
no no  
<unk> you must have very long shirts  
we use f. f. t. to do detection  
and erase the mic  
experience  
if you you can use remote like this with all the functions  
the name is no of in fact yeah is is yeah  
nice  
yeah i know  
right  
right we're gonna try out the electronic white boards  
mm-hmm mm mm  
great  
um  
um  
but also <unk>  
okay  
yeah it's hard to uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
it's different  
but it's essential that there is a screen  
do you agree  
that's right  
<unk> one student or yeah  
if you are on a whole document uh a whole series level and that was a double click  
it's within budget it's does everything that we wanted it to do  
so now i i think you uh see it um its statement  
yeah  
and we can start meeting  
so it it's better a better device than uh  
yeah  
with the help of speech <unk> you can yeah  
maybe almost like a <unk>  
yeah  
um what functions we actually need and then how to group and arrange these on the actual  
'cause it has only one button  
ah yeah just make it we'll make it a two  
so i <unk> mm you know  
what's happened here  
so i'll save that  
mm-hmm  
ah no hard plastic  
yeah we could <unk> yeah a bit  
you need more things it's not just buying a new control re remote you need buying control remote buying uh  
even <unk>  
<unk> yeah  
<unk> hmm  
<unk> but um but the spongy idea i like  
uh  
and um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it  
i think  
so i i found a couple of examples that were kinda like that  
so we don't have any normal buttons that uh no alright  
so  
very true  
mm yeah  
yeah  
than bigger  
you can even have them in different <unk> as well  
because the acronym has star burst in it uh galaxies in it in the s. and if the acronym includes its  
i'm not sure what the default  
bouncing on top  
right  
yes  
so we have to have it one colour  
i mean in a sense you also want to make sure that the annotation that that they the agreements that you arrive on today  
do we have to guess  
yeah  
yeah and like not not yeah  
i think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production  
the <unk> panel we <unk> you would hide with some more uh rubber layers like we discussed early on  
but we  
that is true  
it's still yeah  
but we might as well  
yeah  
and of course you don't always know where all buttons are so it should be visible al um in dark too  
no problem  
but at least yeah you have something to verify their wa  
anyway it's  
okay  
okay  
with cherry on top  
they show it works for <unk> but then you try to use some different databases you see it doesn't work  
um  
yeah  
turn the sound off  
twenty <unk> a lot better quality though  
okay  
yeah but it's just a scroll wheel which you can push down  
but i mean the most i ca you don't need a one  
just gives us a rough idea of where the <unk> the will to spend money on t. v. equipment is  
that's uh the integration story again  
i mean a nice although we do um <unk> uh is i'm recalling that she mentioned that we <unk> need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um  
yeah would you have to do like music notation and stuff  
we would just be able to make it flat and  
mm-hmm mm mm  
and then i went back and replaced i replaced it in the whole transcription  
but then there are surely there are many other <unk> functions that could possibly be added to them  
yeah <unk> yeah yeah  
hmm  
or  
and uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use  
rubber  
yeah we are addicts  
yeah  
okay  
something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface u. s. b. interface as in the in uh digital camera  
so the i mean th i don't think i think it'd be more sensible just to do the non the the video part of it first and then you add the voice over afterwards  
okay  
so it's it's not quite spongy but spongy i would say is yeah so we're in  
data functions hidden at back  
interesting  
no c. d. <unk> are not enough like no  
radio loud quasar should be in z. equals two shouldn't  
okay just battery  
li like device that uh pops open  
mm  
yeah i agree  
i think that's a bit  
if you left them in hopefully it wouldn't affect the way the programme works  
i can give you a number um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight  
sure  
and that of all the buttons on the remote control  
yep  
yes one two degree is very very small for uh for our application  
but on <unk> level whether we actually whether there's some way to just represent meetings as as topics  
mm  
yeah i i uh well i pointed them out here just to make it a little bit easier  
uh do you have any question uh regarding uh that  
<unk> i <unk> i say five  
now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an l. c. d. screen  
i <unk> it is it is  
however our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium so i assume i'm i was given an okay to use it  
and you should explain why you draw that particular animal  
and uh <unk> some of the main functions would be switching on switching off  
well presumably not  
in their uh clothes shoes and furniture and that they want spongy material  
uh actually we are using just gaussian windows here instead of those <unk> because they are more uh no  
so you can right  
it's very fast  
so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time so  
just tap somewhere  
but i i it all <unk> and i is it doing all what we want but without the slide uh precision  
yeah  
so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about  
<unk> and  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
'cause that would be i mean extra components extra designs um larger <unk> uh remote control  
yeah  
on on a chapters you know on a d. v. d. player  
see that's what i was thinking  
and maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking  
do you think  
we don't have to use that top  
ye i think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually because television and beer is not a rare combination  
i don't yeah you know in terms of in terms of say measuring whether or not they're talking about the slides or off channel  
oh okay <unk>  
very good  
thirty minutes  
like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like  
i want to say i'm the secretary so i make the minutes  
people want to have a power button  
um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation  
and people could  
if you press a button it turns green  
okay  
titanium material  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
couple innovative ideas  
uh sort of um squishy  
<unk> yeah i uh for c. t. s. petr uh still i think have he didn't uh lose anything so  
so that uh that's not much work  
yeah my vote goes out to the right  
which is really bad  
there's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well  
we should have a general idea of how it's gonna look  
um  
but if that's better than language for the for the remote  
um where's the bin in here  
uh  
so is this the priority then  
yeah  
and the lights  
'kay  
thanks  
um this time about <unk>  
so you'd you  
yeah just light on top  
thoughts  
but i wouldn't is h. alpha broad brand  
okay  
rubber things  
so this is not <unk> really to do to to do control  
we're <unk> let's use elegant although the the the people the word on the street is is  
'kay  
that's very important  
uh  
yeah  
sure it is important for this case  
yeah <unk>  
uh in one colour  
the other is one to keep the phase like this one like two <unk> one the phase and one the magnitude  
plastic  
you can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself at home  
i don't like that at all  
what you mean clothe  
so you have to be you have to be ready by then  
yeah  
and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty  
yeah but  
what do you think about uh putting a battery in it but also selling like uh the covers  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
oh maybe we should do three or something that <unk> you know our  
um the menu structure  
no  
can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l. c. display uh an uh  
uh sample speaker yeah  
and if we're marketing it as a high niche product then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good t. v. <unk> as well yeah presumably  
consensus  
uh you gotta <unk> yeah  
that's it  
maybe titanium maybe some wood  
okay  
yeah  
the user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features  
a good good good thing  
'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you <unk> if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other  
yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works  
well thank you for a very productive meeting  
um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take  
it takes the three uh four sorry four here uh five and six  
phase two is the conceptual design  
uh so in which uh  
oh my god it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do  
yeah  
yes sure but so at the moment we have a dialogue act window and a graphical display <unk> i'm not sure  
mm  
in the actual one  
and that's it  
yeah  
um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent  
is it beautiful  
really low no  
so is that just another representation of text  
let's start  
everyone uh wants to buy it so we <unk> yeah  
yeah  
um we know that the <unk> gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it  
i think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager  
which is ma not necessarily a bad thing  
yeah  
uh the buttons are normal etcetera  
but i don't why why not uh so there will be other data their test data  
it's not necessarily what they say  
let's do it  
but nobody said anything about al being allowed to or not allowed to  
the selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five euros  
mm  
mm-hmm  
i think it would be useful yeah  
mm  
uh because of costs  
lime i dunno green colours <unk> whatever it's just an idea  
eyes and mice  
yeah  
it's you guys  
yeah  
the l. c. d. doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big  
no it's too much  
alright  
yeah  
because it seems like a very  
mm-hmm  
yeah the only problem there might be which know i if it's very sensitive they will i don't know  
mm <unk> before answering the questions uh th there's also a point of uh precision of <unk> if you use an array  
hmm  
so  
then a spell check might make make sense  
<unk> yeah yeah we had for muting yeah  
yeah  
oh yeah  
um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
gosh why didn't i think of fish  
ah  
yeah <unk> colour  
so it may actually be important to have the blinks registered in there because you may discover you need to take them into account to smooth some kind of analysis that you're doing  
i suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number  
mm  
yeah good point  
<unk> uh yeah  
so we have give him give it a cute name  
you can see the remote control is r. and r.  
type in your report  
which is really just maybe one or one and a half phones and then repeated and then you don't really know whether one is a long duration of one or whether it's actually two  
so it's <unk> um you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to <unk> to select the channel  
so it's just after just after it prints the line starting experiment uh uh yeah  
are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft with some fancy algorithm or manually or we're just taking the single most highly valued key word utterance for the segment heading  
the what sorry  
um and as for the the actual components um uh steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture  
or you can give them it depends which way around you wanna do it  
yeah wa wa you actually  
roughly  
christmas gift or  
have a push button interface  
okay  
the keys yeah  
okay  
grey and yellow  
uh is it uh possible to read p. d. f. <unk> or just standard text  
mm-hmm  
okay  
even if it's a jog wheel it's still repetitive  
i said i feel like madonna with one of these on  
<unk> it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control  
uh <unk> as i said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in <unk> for example with a pair of scissors or something like that  
okay  
i think you'd want the whole thing in some extent  
due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues  
so i'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause i have a slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about  
uh was that helpful or  
so uh how  
vote  
shall i take your uh power  
i only <unk> have three slides so  
good idea  
uh buttons  
um  
yeah i would type it as two  
maybe you but we don't know much about production cost  
but i think that's really unlucky  
yeah okay  
so we have seen the prototype  
i wouldn't be able to do it that fast  
both women and men yeah  
yeah  
'kay  
that's that's pineapple remote control  
i shouldn't have said colour but just  
let's go ahead  
okay  
yeah so it that is not a problem  
nobody will know  
it'll be like the old referring expression <unk> uh uh visualization um the map task  
it's not a big problem  
mm-hmm  
do you know what i mean  
cool  
maybe some minor will appears  
it's true  
yeah  
it's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree  
yeah and uh  
for two seconds then it brings you back one level or something  
because yeah  
yeah  
no  
but  
and make it you know we we um  
he's uh four and half months  
are we still gonna dump it into a database  
that sort of thing  
you can you can <unk> take my chair  
does it  
well i don't ha really have much to add um because most of things we already said in uh  
so i might take two weeks off two weeks off in uh may yeah sometimes yeah  
yeah  
and finally i i will <unk> i introduce some related work yeah  
um and they can look after themselves  
big brother  
because we have we have <unk> twenty five minutes  
do you mean an action in terms of what the group is requiring him to do or do you mean an action in like picking something up  
oh oh  
whereas because we had the l. c. d. screen here we had to move them downward so what you could say is that  
only the feel  
so it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about  
and and do we want um  
mm  
they are utterances aren't they  
no it it is pretty straight forward  
yeah  
alright  
if we change the <unk> uh the joystick thing into a button up button down button right button left  
yeah  
that  
functional requirement by me ebenezer  
yeah  
oh  
yes  
true  
it should only cost twelve and a half euros of course  
yeah  
because it should be an even  
so what mark should we give for that  
and just build one in memory  
um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that  
yeah  
yeah so that does doesn't doesn't that mu i think  
yeah where is that email  
but that would mean it would still play the uh in your audio unless we sort of also store what pieces we cut out for the audio  
but uh  
well i was thinking about design remote control with our uh motto and all  
i miss coffee  
oh nay a volume changing second  
we can either go for a really cheap model keep all of the costs down  
yeah but that's line ratios  
yeah <unk> good  
yeah  
we spoke about last meeting  
okay this is yeah  
so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional  
alright so based on this evaluation do we average them out <unk> thing  
okay <unk>  
of  
then linear access then random access  
or the rubbery we cannot  
hmm  
yeah ma perhaps just just an idea  
i have no more email  
but i think absorption  
yeah  
alright  
project documents sorry i put it in the shared documents  
okay but not more than well yeah it's no  
mm  
why why moving away from hand held why  
b. r. e. and something like that  
four  
so th  
it is  
alright did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about  
no  
maybe <unk>  
absolutely  
mm yeah  
i yeah  
requirements  
which i think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand shape like if we put the the scroll button on the side that could be particularly useful  
and then i'm coming back just in time for the conference  
like we'll <unk> yeah  
uh then i'm sure the target market is uh ten million units  
might use  
yeah  
uh i'm into marketing  
it was made for text classification  
but uh you can use it for like two three kilo bits per second and it works  
you know  
so and and i i like to use the ones  
yeah we'll go we've got the mailing lists out now isn't isn't it  
i would say so yes because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes and that is a separate unit  
<unk> why not to keep the same length what is the  
how long the how long the bit the batteries long  
yeah  
about nine in total  
yes  
a pear  
we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point  
i think yeah and then you have the audio settings channel setting video settings  
'cause if my grandad would buy this remote he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do  
yeah  
it repeats uh your saying  
do we incorporate the idea of trying to <unk> locate the remote control again via a beeping noise  
or was it just okay  
that's uh that's a good one  
it and you can train it like only your speech or it's general uh it's quite interesting yeah  
yeah line  
you're right yeah  
okay  
so we're gonna talk for a little while  
yeah  
it's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky  
yeah  
yeah  
are they doing um uh i are are they uh i as in the kick off meeting just exchanging information to get started with a project or are they uh actually addressing some specific design um criteria at the moment  
yeah  
uh it's more like means there are different speech technologies which are existing so d. t. w. could be kind of which is the easiest  
i think uh it gives us the advantage of  
um consumers in general the number one thing that was found was that uh the <unk> <unk> television remote control  
okay  
or something like that  
i don't see why not  
you have the report  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck  
is plastic  
star forming galaxies should be in  
oh you go  
at the moment we have fifteen buttons one l. c. d. screen one advanced chip on print  
yeah yeah  
so uh the first shape of the table the shape of the table obviously is one of the factor on that will change the collaboration  
and neither did the older generation but the younger generation who we are catering for  
yeah  
okay thank you  
and then secretary has separate room  
how do you look how does it look  
alright  
i don't think so <unk> either  
any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting  
yeah  
you take your uh remote with you to school  
and the volume button will will become  
are you sure i got it all head's kinda small  
normally a circuit board is made of <unk> uh and the wires are made of copper  
i don't think like that  
yeah  
um i just write  
yeah  
i got like this big black border uh on every side  
um  
good idea  
i dunno what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point  
go back there  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
yes i am  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
for the future prototypes  
so this would this would be straight  
yeah  
so we have to look at  
um 'cause i think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor partly something like a computer  
how the buttons yeah  
yeah okay wood is out  
okay  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
okay it's gonna have to be plastic  
no  
so maybe  
five  
omni directional  
mm  
yeah  
yeah okay  
anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting  
in the beginning yeah  
what is special colour  
th that's the button uh no  
a slap on sticker  
wonderful well done  
so based on that i think  
and uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot t. v. and uh who who <unk> can use a lot this uh  
does it provide enough energy  
yeah  
hereby the meeting is finished  
that's you you should have uh  
there is nothing  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
um another concept is what uh apple has come up with  
because you won't get it right the first time  
but i if you want to really construct the speech signal or the you need also the phase signal  
oh okay  
fronts is a bit thicker so th then it falls over your hands  
i guess  
'cause we it shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration  
that's a very good elephant  
ah  
gotta do what you gotta do  
okay  
mm  
okay  
blue ones particularly  
'kay that should be it  
oh <unk> it's not for that  
so i should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote or uh or how i don't really  
okay fine that's fine that's uh uh uh <unk> certain words it should  
a uh um a serious constraint  
oh mm  
yeah  
there is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter  
oh that's the okay sure sure sure  
yeah the results will be  
um yeah so if performance wise it generally works fine for the display it shouldn't make much of a difference  
yeah well <unk> the base station is made out of <unk> many units of plastic  
it doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours  
okay thanks  
yeah great  
yeah if if that that do then maybe we can talk again whether um i it it make sense  
then if it's just sitting on the  
the only <unk> the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers  
you know here and then a tenth of a second later here and then a tenth of a second later here  
so what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept  
least like expressive and <unk> contain less information  
you can have uh  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
it's all relative but it's still a <unk> of that line  
i'm not sure if this is legal  
well we understand  
we've done too much in the previous meetings  
yeah  
okay  
we didn't implement anything about that  
let's see  
it should be  
yeah  
i'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask don't tell  
and then and change the fashion of remote controls  
okay  
yeah  
which happens sometimes when you do compression or acquisition uh you you uh <unk> you will automatically find this in uh the signal right  
yeah  
um  
yeah i've got it  
um  
<unk>  
uh  
mm-hmm  
that's a good thing to keep in mind  
it just looking for improvements what what you could have improved  
yeah i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too  
anyway the the <unk> uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but i <unk> i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the  
having said that dave we could probably <unk> like if we want  
but then we we've got to uh run through the <unk> evaluation process again  
yeah but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working  
who would like to start us off  
he's <unk> writer  
yeah  
other uh things we used here  
maybe  
yeah i would say <unk> maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere  
okay  
what about  
okay  
the t. v. maybe the sound system as well all in one go is that kind of  
mm-hmm  
i mean that's this is kinda not exact case that exceptions are made for really  
okay so are you done <unk> with what you wanted to presented us uh in regards with these questions  
make a start yeah  
well if you if you take your hand before it okay it won't work but you can point it just to the other wall  
mm uh  
no  
yeah  
'cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries a docking station  
i think it's it should be i mean what do you associate with rubber  
the programme up and down  
it's there is no the construct right  
well <unk> four five buttons it's sufficient  
the locator function  
mm-hmm  
the  
it's it's pretty uh yeah i mean you have to look on on the menu  
um but it is like with a with a value with a density value  
yeah i like that i like that idea a lot  
yeah  
thingy  
i think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons and the cushions as well should be in another colour  
great thank you very much nathan  
because if i <unk> if i can't evaluate i can't do any better  
a false yeah  
mm 'kay  
i've  
if it's a little bit too small bit quicker now  
however i've got a couple of worries about that  
so we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and  
and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up  
touching the screen  
and then that's it  
okay  
try to write your name in in writing letters of course yeah  
with the changeable covers to fancy it up  
so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss  
width  
i think it's this one  
okay  
right  
hmm  
okay and we're not yeah  
so you feel titanium  
project manager  
fudge  
yeah  
or  
then  
mm mm  
yeah  
okay go again  
what you mean then don't don't use a google page because it's uh too uh <unk> root but uh another page mm  
volume  
'cause that's what i'm gonna need when i'm uh like getting search results  
in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side  
okay gabriel  
no it looks like a cat  
what effect the apparatus should have  
well alright uh you know who i am and what i do  
one thing that uh we're going to do is become more acquainted with the the tools that we have access to for our project  
yeah  
that's the problem  
and that's the criteria i i found more useful  
mm-hmm  
to reduce the cost it's okay  
so we're <unk> we're meant to comment on leadership and the means e. g. <unk> digital pens et cetera  
mm-hmm  
and so that is much more like um the um the literature from mcgrath about the different kinds of activities groups get into  
well i i brought up some exactly but i think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there  
oh it's okay  
yeah  
ah  
so we just have to <unk> hope we don't have an any subjects with the odd <unk>  
well she  
no it's true yeah  
yeah  
is that so  
yeah we're gonna do that but i think we should <unk> probably send out um separate calls okay  
uh  
i believe it's  
uh  
i don't know what <unk>  
yeah more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time  
this is it  
there you go  
yeah it's very difficult and  
so  
you know to integrate the fruit aspect you know the the in  
and like on the means <unk> since we're on the topic of the technology uh are there any like what are our options  
<unk> we got  
but i don't know uh if  
is that okay with you  
um  
do like this  
and uh <unk> <unk> <unk> so i had a little less time to complete  
i think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use than a manual  
guillermo you want to  
okay  
new  
i think it's easy to implement we should go for that  
that yeah that's a good idea  
'kay  
well just around that eight or or nine people that are  
so i don't think it'd up up the price that much  
so this this is the exchangeable part  
that's the wrong one i think  
ye  
it is let's see i'll find it myself um  
i want what i'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and  
uh the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh well  
yeah got notes and doodles  
oh they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on okay  
uh project process satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means new ideas found  
um  
this one  
and so we will start with uh an introduction  
zapping meaning they go through channels a lot  
i'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training  
not really in a in a formal language but mostly just you know tags right  
in two thousand it was held separately in october  
a well actually just there  
perfect  
new ideas <unk> uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta  
in fact i would propose another solution  
now well this is the idea about uh the bumps  
yes  
yeah <unk> it depends what what you feel about that  
yeah  
even though this is like what you're <unk> i'm initially drawn to just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different  
no um he thinks yeah right  
yeah  
that's true  
we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed  
do we need to do anything  
maybe the r. r. will be in colour as well so yeah  
that could also be built into the t. v. though which might make our remote control a bit obsolete  
in uh we can change <unk> so we have uh eight by eight uh two times <unk>  
mm yeah okay  
yeah i think of it in terms of you know not even maybe to well  
so ti time is running we have to we have to we have to to move forward  
mm well no  
um  
and same with missus m. i. s. s. u. s. i believe  
but that's bringing in the the language thing again  
but games  
hmm  
and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry  
well all the sony telephones use it for example for volume  
yeah  
hmm  
alright  
so we got  
isn't that more the the <unk> uh the user interface part  
l. c. d.  
it's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting but i'll show them  
hello  
'cause if this is all we've got  
no what i mean there's more than they're multiple pieces that look the same  
okay  
so yeah  
but but i guess you mean from the back  
yeah but let's pretend that it's not going to happen in any foreseeable future  
mm-hmm  
quite conventional  
okay  
one  
mm  
to use as a speech recognition engine so  
for example if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition right  
thank you  
and we've got they we've got an email address for them to send all this to haven't we  
well it <unk> it will be still more expensive but for the l. c. d. and this stuff is no problem in the price  
it was uh  
and the buttons are on the next page  
okay  
and that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it  
so okay  
yeah  
champagne  
we take plastic for the basic cover and  
however um alright uh means so <unk> um so really it's uh equipment  
so it <unk> it seems like we should probably get some of these things on the official agenda and say look  
so you so you should start the <unk> really early then  
huh  
and the new product should reach new markets which is the customers below forty  
yeah yeah  
well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in <unk> and such  
and that's it  
uh okay  
right  
but for us it's just like a normal <unk>  
uh i was just um let's talk about little about this presentation itself the slide number six  
well maybe where the one hand  
right  
so that means no locator does it  
so to have in order to have enough <unk> it's in order to have enough <unk> in the evaluation  
but you don't need to mark that as a separate sound  
okay  
'cause we're we're i well we're i assume we're gonna be making quite a small device  
the docking station is a is a little bit innovative  
hmm  
yeah  
okay so l. c. d. it is  
yeah  
mm-hmm yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay thanks  
what a what what about the <unk> speech recognition  
so she typed uh our and i i didn't quite hear that  
and take it to our rooms and uh  
yeah but it has to yeah  
well they they wanted everything we produced so  
don't then you don't see any anything like <unk>  
yeah they are the most t. v. watcher  
yeah  
yeah that would be probably best yeah  
so it would be cheaper to make  
i think that the logo could be smaller  
i'm claiming it intellectual property  
right  
so you know <unk>  
yeah  
at most okay  
but as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re <unk> or something  
something like that  
yeah  
bicycle power  
so how do you reckon teamwork went  
i think it makes the the interface really  
yeah but it takes time  
uh  
i th i think we can do that too  
alexandre  
champagne lunch anyone  
yeah so isn't hard to lose you  
so i think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much  
mm-hmm  
um can i just check if that's a cherry or an apple  
you've got x. ray source r. one seventeen  
but you don't do any voice un voice decision no  
hmm  
a t. v. for autumn and a t. v. for winter you know so it's  
janus <unk> uh mentioned it also  
well that was our brief and we followed the brief  
no  
here  
the fact that it talks to you i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says  
yep  
lefty <unk> righty <unk> right  
we can make it a one  
mm  
yeah  
it's an after dinner dog then  
yeah  
so you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it  
ah okay you do you have just your no  
okay  
huh  
okay  
yeah  
yes definitely  
okay i saw that uh  
no because uh  
okay  
okay  
no  
no i mean in the sense that it's uh <unk> is really big conference for speech so did you attend before  
mm-hmm  
interface to the microphone  
i'm manuel and i'm the industrial designer in in this project um  
damped lyman alpha systems and uh it shouldn't be either of them  
wasn't me  
mm yes yeah they are  
it's the idea  
so both of them have to go  
so that the whole button will shine  
mm-hmm  
very boring yeah  
yeah i'd say definitely a one yeah  
okay  
yeah  
um i i don't know if high <unk> are but low <unk> are  
yeah  
yeah  
because they can be looking at they could look sim simultaneously at somebody's mouse somebody's gaze and some object right  
i um i kinda like the shape  
just you know pick pick some of them redo them in in the <unk> in the j. c. d. format  
yeah  
well there should be after each conference there should be something like ten people should sit down read the papers and then rank them  
if we wanna expand our options <unk> be fashionable then we can get changeable covers  
no no no not that comfy  
we just never bothered to update the stuff because we were working on so we see that we have a very different density curve as well for this one  
i think that this is a human coding that is part of the action coding  
you can go one three or something  
um <unk> cases of <unk> where um maybe the transcriber typed them but really what was said was 'em so where you use the apostrophe  
so um  
um i just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect  
yeah but that would this was just in the design  
excellent so we'll go with speech recognition yeah  
you must have two two modes basic mode where um the <unk> uh left right left right for channels  
yeah  
uh  
i though <unk> it was gonna make a noise  
thanks  
sure  
and yeah and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words  
right  
what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups  
this is really a really basic battery a normal battery  
okay  
oh they've done the pilots  
yeah that's true  
right see you in half an hour then  
not like line width but you can point to line centre  
and uh but i think one thing we <unk> missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting  
and what about the teamwork  
l. c. d.  
would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition  
yeah  
twenty eight forty eight and uh sixty four are those that i want to by cycled with my next button  
solar cells  
and <unk> you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah  
okay that's good yeah  
i think those s. <unk> and e. <unk> and so on the single letters are because of the problem with my um first version of the text thing  
i mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in  
i i only uh received my emails later on  
but i don't actually know of other cases where people bothered marking <unk> anything higher level than the map than the move structure  
yeah  
i suppose we want almost everyone to be using it  
uh  
but the you  
um and when the corporate colour is yellow i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow i don't know  
yep  
ah okay  
okay  
mm is it no  
means  
something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can  
it is i believe also able to talk  
okay  
yeah well it's a bit biased  
um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used menu  
questionnaire coming up  
also with on off switch and infrared uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic  
yeah  
yep  
yeah and email them round  
okay make  
so if you uh  
yeah  
you could uh always see the <unk> actually you know  
but we've also established that it's not just speaker change it because if you have mm-hmm okay then  
mm  
alright  
um uh we i hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction  
no that was my presentation  
smells quite nice  
yeah but there's there'd be no way of coding that automatically right  
uh i it will be easy because there will be on l. c. d. <unk> screen  
it's made edible 'cause kids eat it and if it's wasn't edible then  
um i just um wondered so who's uh then doing um the frequencies on on the words  
no  
and simplified in with transforms in it ascii and it's just it seems to be harder to maintain something that's got that in it if it'd be better to break things up into like steps  
yeah  
but we do  
um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity  
well that's not bad is it  
but um before i do that i <unk> i want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also  
yeah  
reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons  
yeah just testing  
mm mm  
yeah yes say  
kind of like an internal egg  
that would be cool  
yeah  
well <unk> i didn't receive any new requirements or <unk> just no but we decided to use only <unk> basic functions only  
um  
yeah probably somehow it should work that way  
hmm  
the only thing is <unk> is accessing the account  
which  
i when i um let the um just calculate the average f. zero levels  
in the other yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yep that's fine  
the c. t. i. o. four metre telescope is must be what it's called  
no i do like the idea of maybe a <unk> titanium kind type of body <unk> and then with <unk> plastic <unk> around it  
yeah  
yeah  
there's mm  
so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi purpose remote control so uh that's one thing to keep in mind  
yeah and it'll make the costs yeah  
um just to avoid ambiguity  
we have the option of the speaker as well the <unk> the same thing goes for the speaker  
uh <unk> exciting ideas  
because if you have a screen on it you wanna look at your screen  
rechargeable of course because we have the charger  
yeah yeah yeah  
what yeah tape free sorry  
you may not want to have what's on your machine i mean to uh to be to be uh de erased or whats whatever  
well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them and  
yeah alright  
well snake  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
alright okay  
yeah  
yeah al alright yeah  
yeah  
then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh  
so i think we can build that in  
hmm  
about the uh the l. c. d. uh display so  
so again i reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups especially between culture groups and what not  
which just tells you of how much information the presence of a word tells you about which topic it is  
um  
that's talking about the line isn't it  
or not  
can you just push pen and then keep on  
or based around that  
jesus  
um no  
is a feature a <unk> feature  
yeah  
do you think they will be able to use gestures  
so you can still find triangle one whatever  
and i it would be like i mean if you could make it integrate with the t. v. then it could come up with new information about what's on  
yeah people are willing to pay more but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment  
yeah  
we have then the logo on front and on the back  
uh so yes  
yeah  
but that they want this remote control to only be for t. v. um with incorporating the corporate image colour and slogan  
wow  
yeah what is that  
inside the remote  
no it's yeah th it's i i <unk> stamped into it  
is it possible to fit in to that  
hmm  
what you feel  
on the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set  
yeah  
yeah it says a  
so the might yeah i'm sure there must be a way of putting big arrows <unk> or whatever  
so in in that way you're actually keeping the <unk> the same customer attracting them to come back in again and again  
well the nice thing about that is it will automatically be in sentences  
what i do don't know is we wanna bother with a part builder  
yeah  
the remote control  
yeah  
sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework and using their general classes  
yeah it's like black black and white kind of  
with different colours and i just showed you how to pick a colour and also with different pen widths which i also showed you  
i think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the  
but you all like this kind of thing  
it's continuous for dissolve yeah  
uh <unk> shared  
uh you know available  
um no no no <unk> that's <unk>  
you know they're extremely secretive  
right  
or part of it was convex  
and the options uh of teletext  
means looking at uh how much failure has happened  
could be flat you could insert your uh remote into it  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
and  
are we just gonna leave that  
yeah  
what's chip on print  
right  
there's a lot of sort of well does the quality stand up to legal sort of requirements or whatever  
thank you  
so maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more  
yeah  
okay  
i think those are basic <unk>  
uh-huh  
so just dividing the speech into one <unk> one second frames doing d. c. t.  
we should probably set those sizes 'cause that's such an easy thing to do  
okay but like kind of convex or concave  
mm yeah  
'cause the property of the line  
yeah  
yes  
play <unk> edible  
well well what would you display on it then  
mm-hmm  
okay  
we're not marking absorbers  
which i <unk> i really think we need to take into account  
yeah i it's tricky it gets ambiguous  
i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
we should make a big sponge lemon and then it'd be it would be yellow  
they're not used often but they are quite important when they're used  
everything you can do with with the menu  
look you got some cheap uh remote controls there  
<unk> yeah  
i'll th i'll ask her if she'd mind coming down and helping you out for uh a while  
we can make a docking station  
sorry about the small delay  
but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a you know a messenger will go  
it's not really it's not really true  
because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with <unk> learning yeah yeah  
alright welcome back fro to the second meeting  
no  
yeah  
no not this but the task  
okay  
yeah yeah yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
well you might be limited in space that yes  
'cause then you have  
we more used the face than the magnitude  
so electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble  
no  
joystick it's still uh an advanced chip  
let's drop the speech  
uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have  
the children's story  
well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to <unk> have a corporate logo  
industrial designer you are the one you know you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in i guess so um  
well i i i have to say i have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all  
little bit start thinking  
it should be fine  
new features actually  
but <unk> i uh this is with an l. c. d.  
and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use  
with <unk> it's between zero and one so you have not so much amplitude  
then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget  
oh yes sorry then then i would say two or three  
uh-huh  
that's it for the market research  
in you on your own  
so so so <unk> will you actually be doing much of the g. d. f.  
it's looks fancy one yeah of l. c. d. screen  
yeah we haven't actually made a rule that you can't uh collect extra parts right  
and how about some uh some flashing standby lights  
okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay  
yeah  
'kay  
you wanna go first  
it covers everything then  
whoops it's not working  
i mean we've got one of those um <unk> boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the t. v. and then you wait  
oh yeah  
okay so thanks very much  
i th i i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one handed  
um  
okay do we have a corporate colour scheme  
yeah  
yeah okay  
it's uh just it's that i think it's telling us to stop our meeting  
uh we don't move to that project  
that <unk> the hyphen  
eight to ten eight to ten hours  
i don't  
yeah  
you have to make people buy it and uh  
turn it inside  
okay  
built or uh <unk> plastic <unk> 'cause <unk> <unk> that's easy on the cost  
um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this  
two yeah  
um and i mean colour wise what does everybody think  
you say one battery is cheaper  
uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device  
um how exactly  
you know it happens  
yeah i think it's quite easy after the  
which i don't know if i can access the web page from here but i can show you uh  
okay  
have you got a component for displaying lists of matches  
if if  
yeah exactly  
um we've sort of eliminated wood  
what do we this quick what we're going to selling price twenty five euros  
thank you for your  
no  
yeah  
like you how to say all the <unk> and this thing system how <unk> but it's really funny like  
that's true  
yeah  
hmm  
oh sorry just just a screen like a computer screen  
and uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh <unk> razor  
so much better just to go and  
and speaker  
yeah  
okay um are we sure this is double curved  
so this was other costs  
okay  
well a beeping device would be uh furthermore the learning time is a problem  
okay 'cause well the designs are very bright so you're right they're gonna stick out but um  
yeah  
you know the meeting browser people have a lot of constraints  
mm-hmm  
mm right okay  
um and i think um for all the corpus it's just from i know from other times  
oh so  
but so i mean i guess that's not a surprising result then  
i mean we have to look for a trade off  
oh it's that's the that's the would be a pity right  
okay  
uh we have a r. f. for um for beeping for beeping  
you don't have to look and and search for them  
they give a range of products a range of shapes like if we see  
i don't actually know what the results for that were so  
um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially but i think that um from a manufacturer's point of view from a person designing the device  
um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine  
yeah  
yeah  
and the l. c. d. is this one on the remote  
or if you hold it up like that it'll send it  
okay  
i mean the thing is every time we have a break there's a question of whether we actually serve coffee and biscuits and things  
yeah  
so are everywhere  
yeah  
so  
mm-hmm  
do the kind of um truth conditional semantics that you know asher and <unk> have done right  
because the worst thing that can ever happen to you is you discover that you've done huge amounts of analysis and th you actually had the data but you threw it away because you treated it so grossly  
uh thank you for your participation  
so i guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market  
but <unk> maybe we should put some <unk> uh i know that the younger people will most likely have a d. v. d. player they want to  
yep  
yeah i th i think that's difficult because uh that's different material and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of  
mm  
do you plug the computer or something  
well but if you could attach them to the t. v. then you can  
it has to be fashion  
yeah it says right here  
no  
not quite actually  
green  
interface  
is there some already  
it's it's not  
no really  
so yeah <unk> if you do see um something like um u. h. m. for um you you would change that to the <unk> <unk> version  
yeah <unk> but  
well i think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
well i <unk> if we did a <unk> version of the ami data and stuck it into c. v. s. under the automatic contributions then um people would end up using it  
that's prototype  
yeah  
if we want to show him something on monday we definite have to work together  
you two guys  
let's see what did i get through the corporate website  
mm six something  
yeah  
good  
right  
okay  
yeah okay  
mm  
not quite sure what about  
maybe not  
uh and then um there was talk of <unk> uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use  
or do we <unk> make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer  
yeah  
yeah of course  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
but i think that should be i mean um i can speak with the button department  
i mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but  
i think we've come up i think we've covered everything we need to here  
and uh i know that at <unk> they installed uh already in in a in a big uh amphitheatre for students  
i think smells really good  
yeah  
to this together is more expensive than <unk> it's almost the same as <unk> keeping this  
one week from today i shall hear the freedom ring from the hills and and everything and shall then throw myself into new slavery  
yeah  
our competitor  
mm-hmm  
people you know people are saying oh standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury  
so what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain  
okay  
mm-hmm  
oh  
okay  
i don't know  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
uh cutting edge technology i don't think we're gonna have that these were ideas i was putting together  
yeah  
uh i think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product  
and uh then we have to look at something which is less nice the finance uh aspect whether we can afford what we have designed  
alright okay  
it's different yeah  
but it's probably a stream if it exists in java it would be probably some binary stream going in of some type  
maybe it would be interesting if you could look um  
so maybe we should think of yeah  
go jurgen  
okay  
but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell  
yeah  
yeah it <unk> it it'll need uh more than a conventional one it won't be uh just maybe you might use a a. a. battery actually  
it's a giraffe  
<unk> what uh what our new product should look lite like  
okay  
so tuner up and down i guess  
i understand  
okay  
it's overdone  
i guess perhaps it is  
oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back  
so on a scale from  
well it depends on how this i i mean you're talking <unk> yeah just the carrier  
most votes count  
but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident uh the more we sell  
i guess so  
i'm responsible for leading the meetings keeping the notes uh and coming up with the final presentation  
oops  
so  
okay  
yeah  
and what else  
yeah i yeah but uh yeah it's t. k. through for some other task i've run it's t. k.  
yeah  
and twenty  
uh <unk> i'm pretty sure that i can uh always find something to improve there  
yeah  
so it have to it has to be symmetrical  
mm-hmm  
mm  
just fill that one in  
right  
like the <unk> <unk> <unk> the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it  
we don no  
mm  
you can't really see uh the differ from different sides  
oh  
absorption line systems  
okay  
so um i dunno just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking  
mm-hmm  
you know this thing in itself is th bunch of <unk> right with <unk>  
a <unk>  
battery battery use  
mm-hmm yeah  
yeah  
that's not needed  
so um <unk> <unk> kate and kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of <unk> or play dough  
but there are <unk> few  
i like i like it  
nice  
right  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so you didn't save it maybe  
remote control is nothing special nowadays  
just a basic idea of of of the most uh most <unk>  
i think <unk> and i we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two  
it has to be like the the game cube you know where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold  
rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels  
it is sensible  
next slide please  
um  
but um i it it had a lot of buttons on it and you didn't know which one was what  
i'll again be the secretary and make minutes take minutes uh and it will be three presentations just like the last meeting  
and that's the only thing we have left  
i think i'm going to buy it  
it's done both in terms of words and in terms of segments  
maybe the uh the logo  
um  
yeah yeah  
that's true it's true  
yeah it'd be nice for a presentation yeah yeah  
uh which is of course um part of the back actually because it's also titanium  
well then you change it  
well thank you all  
volume up and down  
mm-hmm  
okay  
as long as so are we gonna say <unk> we have to keep an eye on the time as well but we're gonna say um single curved design  
so at lea especially l. v. c. s. r. in really big systems then people  
but that's ex that's expensive  
and a third thing is  
oh i've received a mail with uh some additional requirements  
you have heard that uh already i think so  
does it match the operating <unk> of the user  
so but for instance because the l. c. d. is not uh touch control touch screen you cannot go to channel twenty five directly  
if one of us could email claire  
it's the friday  
i heard a beep go  
sorry  
transmitter receiver speakers  
yeah  
yeah not the t. v. <unk>  
yep that one  
yeah  
um yeah  
and also with i don't know how to use <unk> so it takes me forever to get something done with it  
uh we use kinetic energy  
so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light  
so it after the after after these five minutes you have to  
however the colour we don't have a say in that  
right  
okay uh just wondering if i need to include it in the minutes because if you're submitting it anyway then okay great  
yeah  
and  
i was presuming bigger than the other ones or were you  
and what if we use only one sort of um  
so so am i right in thinking you think that you can segment meetings maybe into two <unk> types of areas interactive and non interactive  
okay  
or  
i'm impressed  
okay um so what are we <unk>  
yeah  
if the  
yeah  
and this board does uh the <unk> compression on the fly  
you know two  
yeah that's the one  
okay  
does this prototype match the operating <unk> of the average user  
<unk> you went to the company website  
physical sense yeah  
ah right  
okay and cases  
it was to do with cars basically if you have you have a topic that's uh representing  
uh i think uh <unk> when the selling price is twenty five uh uh you got two million two million remotes  
tape free  
yeah it's okay  
uh-huh hi yeah  
for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible  
like that  
okay  
yeah  
and that's exactly the same  
would you like to plug in your have you got a <unk> or not  
okay  
so i <unk>  
i think uh for the remote um uh less is more  
which which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a  
you can  
um  
should we do <unk> make them very big  
mm  
so  
oh it should be interesting  
yeah  
because it's quite easy in perl as well it's just a line of code for counting all the words and yeah it's it's by hashes  
i think i think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote  
okay  
did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo  
or have you ever seen something like that  
yeah  
now  
i dunno  
i see i see  
yeah  
'cause i think positioning is we're kinda <unk> into the the telephone kind of  
some sort  
we've got an advanced chip we've got the use of the l. c. d.  
okay  
yeah  
suppose we pick up an we we we screwed up the first time we put the triangle with the square and we threw it away and decided we didn't like it  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
wishing i hadn't closed the damn right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device  
and you transcribed that speaker entirely  
<unk> we're done  
um  
twenty five  
hmm  
well i'll buy one here  
was it the nebula thin yeah  
okay  
if they have the same uh yeah  
so if you've got a settings if you  
yep  
okay  
yep  
um i've had kinetic things before  
well uh if not if you guys are using it  
hmm  
because i find with um channel changers that um a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button  
ah  
so what about the <unk> the prototype as it is we've got we've got the speech recognition on it haven't we  
we did send it to him yeah  
nice application  
yeah  
it should actually uh it should actually be loose from the television because it can also be used for other televisions  
when you push a but a button on the t. v. then you hear some uh some sort of bleep  
i was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned you know so you know something similar to a summer dress  
so you think case  
well anyway i have this point  
mm-hmm  
yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is  
because at that point there is no interaction between humans and capture  
but you have to i if you want to consider in terms of recognition have to make it overall  
okay  
this is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out  
yes that's right  
i guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something  
how <unk> uh uh how many colours  
so i'm dealing with the components design  
i guess so  
maybe again  
um do you wanna present the potato or shall i present the martian  
but you know that's not that's not fast enough for little things like this  
mm-hmm  
mm that's a nice world  
but since we have the the eye tracker i th we're gonna have to answer their questions about gaze right  
yeah  
or uh  
yeah  
so for example um i'll just start at the top  
fine  
the ones we want  
<unk> right  
mm  
yeah that is  
i don't think uh i don't think uh darwin would agree with that  
which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business  
but i'm not i'm not sure if it's worth much bother though  
but <unk>  
okay  
i actually like um um i are you actually sure that rainbow is doing a measure like is returning a measure of what we are trying to measure  
we are selling it to an existing market  
oh  
um  
um i want to know why it <unk> uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber  
we need an  
and suddenly we ran out of time basically because what happened was that uh it was supposed to be three hour lecture  
sky or cable one does  
no no in <unk> <unk>  
how many different words can you have for a remote control up down left right  
right  
we have to sell a t. v. with the remote control too  
but can you can you go back to that slide  
mm  
but it's more it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries  
yeah  
one one  
but it it would have been uh useful if i i could show this on the screen  
yeah  
well well the  
new inputs and also it's i'm not convinced about this l. c. d. because you need uh internet connection  
so high quality low acceptance  
mm  
yeah  
yeah yeah of course  
currently you're <unk> the <unk> maximum of your wave form right  
and uh i also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder so you can see them and review what we have discussed  
yeah it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty  
i've some couple of pictures here  
okay  
yeah  
or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it  
okay  
and uh is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment like your t. v. and your home stereo  
yeah  
perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh  
mm-hmm  
got it  
so it's between one and seven  
well i was just saying  
hmm  
yeah sure  
yeah  
so it's just something to consider  
you <unk> you know <unk> as well  
but i i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels  
so it uh <unk>  
yeah  
well we're under cost then  
we could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on  
<unk> true  
uh interact with the buttons the rubber buttons uh  
you could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply  
that that's a fact  
uh uh it it may be reflected as the um intensity or size of a <unk> a cycle  
so are we doing that at all levels  
yeah  
but i um if the order stays the same it's no problem at all to i just write back again  
the <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
you mean that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control  
yeah implemented  
um  
okay cool  
but it is flat you look  
i'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers <unk> <unk> for different people  
no  
which is just uh the current probability of topic one given z. so that's probability old plus uh  
yeah but is it that's not expensive than uh joystick is better  
okay  
and we should sum up its favourite <unk> characteristics right  
mm  
free i like the elephant  
hem <unk> is using difference  
mm-hmm  
mm  
but  
yeah  
no no but yeah yeah  
yes we we should really uh include that one i think  
no no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute we don't have to do some basic research on this field  
yeah  
that's us  
i'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one  
means  
so then i don't have to go up and down  
and associated shouldn't be in  
where is th  
but we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions  
yeah  
oh  
no so we we should use something else  
something like mm like tactile  
well alright  
but job  
mm-hmm  
so it's and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per per unit is fairly high i think  
just like <unk> on a sort of side view  
certainly keep me busy until this time next week when we can start suggesting things that might might need to look at for the next stage i guess  
that hilbert envelope  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
yes  
<unk> uh yeah  
rather mango or something or  
no  
i think it's just t. v. i mean if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say  
but like 'cause  
yeah  
um  
uh <unk> oh uh this ma this johann waters or like no they <unk> what they did portland o. g. i. they did l. p. c. based synthesis  
yeah it it has some cost but  
i <unk> have no idea  
yeah  
we're not trying to to fit yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah the project is evaluated  
we've maybe lost  
but rather than saying it is somebody's at the white board it'll be you know that somebody's explaining something that the others are focussed on  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
unbelievable  
oh we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want  
well we can't with the price range  
mm-hmm  
okay 'til you spoke and when i wrote this i don't know what i'm marketing  
so th th this would be double curves  
yeah  
okay i'm convinced  
so i think a two  
so we need to examine each element separately but we're designing a full thing so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole  
you can the logo can be on on every uh front  
um and i think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay  
no  
oh so yeah  
so we don't look at the other things like the radio or something  
twenty six to thirty five years seventy six percent and thirty six to forty five thirty five percent  
okay  
i would say <unk> i'd say scrap that straight off  
if it is kids uh things like that  
yeah  
it was not something like speech coding or that d. c. t. transforms  
but uh personally i think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design  
yeah  
written down that it was really there  
yeah  
yeah but i think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad  
a automatically um lights up at first touch  
yep  
thank you  
where does the number four come from  
yeah exactly  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
right  
it's not a competition  
<unk> you know like up arrow down arrow for for volume  
mm-hmm  
yeah so when i think it's  
will you buy one  
i mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say i mean it's not a one definitely  
yeah  
inspiration  
okay  
basically what we want here is a remote control right  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
and then you can more or less uh <unk> those segments somehow and use it for encoding let's say or and it worked <unk> yeah yeah  
it sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender  
no signal  
mm  
and the last <unk> parental advisory function  
and what else  
i'm not sure uh i really i'm no i have no clue what we could use the scroll wheel for  
because this is huge uh this <unk> very very uh expensive paper  
so if you have five black triangles there gonna be five black triangles in the parts box  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but i also like the <unk> the side buttons on that one like i think that's kind of neat  
and what kind of supplements we'll have  
i'm trying to <unk> i'm trying to interpret my note here  
okay  
well i mean it's probably more fruit and <unk> than most other things out there bar fruit and <unk> so what four  
the trends from the past years what the people like what the youngsters like what the elderly people liked about shapes colours  
twenty five euros  
mm-hmm  
you're probably going to be using or learning about the same techniques that you'll need for doing other things along these lines  
if you're all ready  
okay so not too fast writing  
okay  
sounds good  
yeah  
management  
mm-hmm  
<unk> <unk> only only the last point your no <unk> not not out of question i guess  
um um  
to be with it and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience  
we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate  
with you  
'kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then  
yeah yeah yeah  
rubber casing because well if you use an uh <unk> a touch screen uh it's just a casing uh around it  
that's the intention yep  
yeah then he can split that window at point n. say point n. so then you will have gyro two no you can segment it maybe  
ooh  
at the end uh i will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder  
the the configuration should not well i also saved the configuration somewhere in the temp  
yeah  
but it's al is that also the name of the source  
yeah  
yeah i think yeah  
<unk> yeah  
that's its head  
yeah  
yeah  
the sides  
basic requirements but of the pro of the project  
yeah you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office  
uh by pushing zero after after the first one  
so i'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls  
mm-hmm  
so  
but still we we need to continue on this  
is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any  
i guess i'll go first  
getting destroyed  
what about a smell  
yeah  
okay  
no me neither  
our characteristics sum it up  
yeah and uh we're going more for the trends than for the <unk> anyway right  
oh it smells good  
yeah  
here  
two curves  
mm-hmm  
or escape  
hmm okay  
but um this button um because it's red it's sort of very prominent  
i mean we have a option in the remote control  
and then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time  
l. c. d.  
mm-hmm  
th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change  
no i think they got good results with just using diagonals or definitely yeah  
yeah i i think  
associated again which means nothing  
yeah  
well what i think i might try and build is basically a class that you just feed it a linked list of um different wave forms  
mm-hmm  
look at the smallest thing toffee chocolates they give a variety of different things  
uh just in general  
well that's next channel  
'cause we we won't have run out of our pot of play doh  
mm yeah price  
right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing  
so i wouldn't need it  
so this is gonna be from the  
i'll review some of these things um after i go through this a bit um just to re cap  
'kay thank you  
is that it  
but  
so  
right so i'm just gonna start this <unk> real quick  
anything that they think has been missed out  
although i haven't come up with the final circuit yet  
yep  
<unk> fifty five euros  
after that we have to make a conceptual design and then after that a detailed design  
it's only supposed to be proper names  
just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh  
like random which we have no other place to put but we need it somewhere there  
get  
uh that's the menu  
or did you  
it depends uh on whether we will use the l. c. d. and mainly the speech recognition because the speech rec yeah  
you know we don't need to <unk>  
hey now i understand the random like <unk>  
should i write the banana down or  
'cause it's so 'cause it's green  
hmm  
well it is it is more uh i mean it is more eco friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
huh  
alright  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like  
i was having a look in it a look at it as well and i noticed the um the speakers are all in that separate file  
real reactor  
uh um i mean we still have to uh to make a profit huh  
as a well i mean there's two two cases in here right  
so as you see <unk> uh it's working uh better than the standard h. m. m. g. m. m. system  
it will probably um no i don't think it would  
no like  
yeah  
that  
no no no  
okay  
it does also lie flat but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand  
no no you kate you're exactly right there  
yeah  
one scroll button and  
this is the orange button the microphone  
yeah  
we can also just not use them  
but  
yeah  
'kay  
yeah  
technology technical technologically innovative  
and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume  
or  
me neither  
could have up to <unk> i mean the buttons could <unk> could be up to three colours 'cause that how it's designed there  
yeah  
that sort of <unk> probably go down well and the market research has been on that side of things hasn't it  
alright  
even though the cost may be low  
right but but you're  
yeah hand dynamo  
i mean to say i i mean to say that it's okay  
yeah  
and if you puts a ye  
mm  
i'll i'm pretty sure it's just yeah  
it will be bought by people under the age of forty  
because apparently yeah  
yeah i mean <unk> we can't my my t. v. has but we we can leave them uh away  
mm  
can you go to the next one  
i think it would be difficult technologically  
from like your personal coach person and stuff like that do you think maybe  
yeah  
plus  
okay  
market is a of remote controls you know it better it's very  
<unk> <unk> uh anna  
at twenty five  
you know it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing  
ah <unk>  
most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the t. v.  
okay  
what are the measurements you'd apply  
yeah it's no problem  
'cause i thought it was only men so 'kay  
okay  
yeah  
so it was kind of the whole thing would be removable  
but if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this if you put it on the top on the side i dunno  
i don't think insurance company will give  
the chip uh produces morse code um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed of course  
okay so i mean i think that um there are a lot of things that we have to look at before i mean  
i don't know whether the trend will change  
fox  
okay  
i thought it was only for television  
we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control  
with the lights it it's it's kind of future  
dialogue act yeah  
yeah  
if that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction  
exactly  
but apparently not  
you can hear it but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is  
just play a ten kilo hertz sound over the over the speech and then just um compare the two signals basically  
go heather pauls  
okay  
i'm not a hundred percent sure but i'm not having crashes at the moment  
yeah  
alright  
i as project manager ha don't have a clue  
which is referencing to these segments here and another attribute which is the the value  
uh that <unk> that's all  
mm  
yeah these are <unk> <unk> species ions again not individual lines  
we can uh well it look like this  
so  
four  
uh  
nice user interface  
okay well thank you very much  
uh  
mm  
yep  
because you don't always use the menu  
okay  
johan  
that would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such yeah  
so that's the most important thing for our customers  
we already we're uh yeah we already have the the th th th base station gadgets  
mm-hmm  
and uh i'll ask you later on like if you still have your notes  
it should be possible  
yeah  
wireless uh-huh  
we agree on that right  
i think for example it's it's huge i think the l. c. d. is huge it consumes batteries like hell  
yeah but just  
the solar not many remotes  
and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one  
i guess that's true  
and that's what we're gonna do as well  
<unk> do you have numbers <unk> <unk> on that  
yeah you had information i didn't have and then uh  
no not anymore  
and uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it  
and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um  
uh  
oh they're a bit clunky  
mm yeah  
yeah  
i think we can launch a couple of packages  
yeah  
cool  
but it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the <unk> and the fruity looking uh type  
yeah  
so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip  
so and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push button inside the <unk> thing  
so  
in that uh <unk> in the mod  
so they don't mean they mean photons in the lines escape  
hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless  
we have very demanding clients  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
they're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it  
but it isn't  
it has to uh not be loose  
there are a lot of um strange event tags that the eye link produces that are fairly meaningless i think  
yeah or or the integrated scroll wheel push button  
um i suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one  
after this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that <unk> mail  
you have one in mind  
yeah yeah i agree  
so even on one we can tell  
this was the first step yeah  
things  
okay  
so <unk> the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it <unk> this practical function  
i'm not sure if it costs a lot that that's what he <unk>  
okay  
yeah and following  
ah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
next  
okay  
mm-hmm  
like if i want to put volume up i like do mm i take my remote control do like something like  
like holding something and the l. c. d. to be just on top of it you know somehow  
just to participant one  
okay  
but basically the thing is we have this technology available  
right so it's got like a limited memory and programme it  
so just by pressing the button with some code you <unk> you put a lock onto the remote so that he can't use even  
so is that gonna be an extra one on each side  
okay  
or say this can be back  
i'll be the vanna  
um  
uh you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed  
and making this plastic  
uh i will address them uh in a moment  
yeah  
yep  
but even you can use as a can you use that phase directly  
or of course the amplitude is just not constant all time  
it's the box below it huh  
and um that's about it  
that's that's the smart  
yeah right  
yes boss  
really  
yes  
nice  
now it's my time to ruin everything  
so we just add that to profitability in effect  
yeah  
no no <unk> no th they will  
um we want it to be something original something trendy and also something user friendly  
to make this product unique  
yes 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know  
mm-hmm  
yes  
but but you can open a from your <unk> from your laptop  
yeah  
well th more less they don't care what's uh what will be the quality of the of the or the bit rate  
yeah  
just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings but  
okay  
of channel  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
uh  
so uh what is the task is usual just take the speech of course somehow to encode it into as as small number of beat as possible and with a reasonable quality of course  
yeah it says a lot but  
well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand mean uh the the the the  
yes  
a long  
yeah  
and a see through uh  
thanks that's what i was asking  
okay  
yeah but you don't have much money generally  
yeah  
i mean all we have is two push buttons and two <unk> do we really need an integrated circuit to  
think is also rated higher in the non agreement than in the agreement  
yeah  
he wrote it well  
yeah  
he has a lot of uh phone calls to make even if it's here if he's here only fifty per cent of the time  
yeah  
if you  
but is emission line a. g. n. a separate class from a. g. n.  
yeah  
why not  
but it is smallish  
now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result  
mm-hmm  
in or out  
you wanna know whether it's one of these little post processes going wrong or whether it's just the thing that dumps it into the multiple files for the and g. d. f. to n. x. t. transform is <unk> is pretty simple  
um what we could use is or what i was offered or what we could use is a basic <unk> battery  
but yeah  
so we have the teletext we have here we have the mute  
<unk>  
you should perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off  
yeah  
and they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control they want to zap between channels on t. v.  
doesn't need to be completely yellow but just mm  
no more question  
yes  
ah  
yeah  
okay  
so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board  
rubber  
a and no <unk> before like uh  
but uh  
a apple  
uh using the scroll button on sides uh <unk> uh i uh um  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
that even if she's here only half time  
something a bit squishy and  
she uses it to make phone calls and that's it  
well you have to use the advanced chip if you have the l. c. d. screen  
mm  
and i think uh everybody's uh very happy  
yeah g. s. m. <unk> band  
will be hero  
oh yeah  
yeah because it has to uh <unk>  
or like the rate is probably a property which in the worst case we'd have to set public  
alright thank you  
how many colours are we going to  
i think that uh  
real reaction remote  
she's using but she's actually relaxed that somewhat  
so the power button obviously in an hour is only used once  
yeah  
um you might have to do some <unk> basic separation  
yeah okay let's give it a six  
well what <unk> what was the question  
yep  
uh yeah  
i think that's it isn't it  
so it's curved it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker  
right  
um back to technological in in innovation not quite as important but still a big issue  
so you can always expand it back so that you get the <unk> that you get a fit to the to the original thing  
can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now  
no  
yes but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button  
well it doesn't it doesn't react to it being changed automatically  
so they're gonna be yeah that's right a. is gonna be on triangle one and various other places  
to what are the experiments you need to do  
yeah  
no  
or with exterior designs  
okay that's great  
i depend on you  
it's true  
and you're sitting down in front of and you could see yourself but not only could <unk> you see yourself you see yourself bounce back two seconds later  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
there there are time stamps um for well  
so we're okay this way around  
what do you say  
right that that that those are features  
innovation for this one is two  
two is an ionic species and it'll have a number of  
it's crazy  
perhaps you can then copy page or so  
but you haven't looked at it no in very much detail  
mm-hmm  
or what if it looks like a pen  
that is main uh uh information provider uh while the customer is the information seeker mainly  
and we couldn't replace the joystick right  
<unk> okay so we're  
uh-huh  
but i think probably for us like in developing it it would be interesting  
or you can replace it by some <unk> one <unk> generated in a <unk> centre frequency of that gaussian window  
<unk> been a lawyer  
alright  
yeah  
so then c. d. <unk> are not enough  
uh  
mm-hmm  
because if you get new information it's essential <unk> for the other team mates to know that as soon as possible  
<unk>  
uh oh export  
um  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
how do you call that  
the <unk>  
but um i've also included this turbo button because i think you know every design should have a turbo button  
alright  
then they end up modifying building new kinds of relations with new kinds of semantics and adding them  
or if you're watching studio sports on uh on seventeen and your wife is watching some soap on two well yes i think that's a good idea  
i haven't received any specific  
mm  
so  
okay  
but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well  
and inspired colour and and very sophisticated material so  
okay never mind  
this is really interesting change from past years because it is much more organic um some would say approachable  
um if you go to the next slide then  
uh  
okay so these we have to work it out  
i uh now will show it  
i it might be okay  
it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons if we can help it  
but th first uh how big are the chunks  
well we have to decide on the concept  
i think eight hundred six hundred is better  
yeah  
hmm  
<unk>  
and autism  
<unk> advanced chip  
good  
the first kick off meeting  
i it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but i mean <unk> <unk> second question  
i prefer the laser remote control  
mm-hmm  
please  
yeah okay  
what the  
okay  
does anyone have a good idea like at the moment to play around with it  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours and they don't use uh wood  
uh no i think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions 'cause i'm confused  
segment in here attaches actually can we not tie it to the segments file  
okay yeah  
well i i don't think yeah i can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology  
sort of have its little dock that you could put it in  
yeah  
a horse  
yeah  
but  
you with your brilliant ideas  
um  
yep  
um is this your  
actually we had  
so that as long as i as long as it's not a <unk> event okay  
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy  
and also you can i i think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design  
yeah you can fit it into your palm you know  
this is a team building time where um okay cool um  
true  
yeah  
how much  
you've just gone off the window into another one  
it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be  
well what that's what you want trying to say  
yeah  
ah  
yeah  
or <unk> <unk> multi media thing  
yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control  
i think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members  
mm-hmm  
yeah but but why not work here together for example  
mm-hmm  
so uh the important point that i read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make  
okay  
yeah they are more less they are same like  
personally i think it's really ugly  
but uh but i think we don't have to make  
but uh <unk> i've <unk> ni <unk> has gone dead for all those last two weeks  
yeah that's in the functional design uh folder  
yes  
they wanna dispute that this is what they actually said by the recognition  
i i <unk> yeah  
we'll meet each other what uh we already do so that's not uh very much trouble  
so  
so maybe if you could have some kind of  
they are smart boards  
special colour or it's only on the  
you know you're we're inviting like from quite a wide audience we give priority to linguists  
yeah  
some some sub window or the the whole ten seconds of speech or what  
yeah  
embedded  
right so uh are the costs within budget yes  
i don't know  
so  
okay  
to potential customers who have to take this questionnaire  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah you can go back up to the feature you know  
we got it to be  
it'd probably still be work out fine because you'd only be comparing to ones within the context  
so not to have one empty room when we have no visitors um and uh then a very full room when everybody is is here  
no it could be command control kind of thing  
mm-hmm  
that's uh  
i think because yeah  
that's right  
well the first step is find out in the what how much of the material does the collaborative problem solving cover  
okay  
that for uh this to be a high tech thing it's gonna have to have something high tech about it and that's gonna take battery power  
oh before you change anything maybe you um save it first  
what do we have to demonstrate  
i don't  
email uh  
mm-hmm  
at the top or at the bottom  
oh  
it was me and him  
so how much of a genre clash is there here  
the interface is push buttons  
i actually tried to transfer it to my documents but  
so it can be  
two  
i think you're supposed to mark the whole thing aren't you  
mm  
okay  
so do they mean the v. l. b. a.  
i think this is in frequency domain this in time domain  
yeah  
but since we're <unk> concentrating on uh the younger group  
we'll probably have to re rate it  
then there shouldn't be a reason why we shouldn't be able to use it on our laptop  
yeah  
right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool  
um  
so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside and so  
yeah  
right  
mm  
i dunno  
but they keep generally their <unk> slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah you can only have one bit  
'kay  
finish meeting now  
but now i don't know where it is  
casting  
no  
so  
so  
so you can say right  
<unk>  
yeah certainly possible  
it's too much uh maybe uh with with the l. c. d. and the docking station and  
but it's just not very clear  
mm the soft excess you can definitely point to on an x. ray thing  
yeah so <unk> so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another <unk> model another another version  
yeah  
mm  
i thin why why shouldn't we take a basic battery  
you can put it on your table with the l. c. d. screen you don't have to put it get it in your hand  
so this is blue  
no okay but we don't have to uh when we don't want to uh control other devices i think it makes it even more simple  
okay so special navigation linear access random access and there's a fourth one no  
yeah <unk> but we we're designing only the remote we not design the t. v.  
some contribution to our project  
yeah to do list or something  
uh add some more underneath here  
i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made given our options  
yeah  
yeah a small <unk> control that they can hold in hand  
not not in the user interface but  
a two  
well  
the basic okay  
one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is <unk> doing some he is knowing about that technology  
mm  
yeah it's uh yeah  
current trends of fruits and veggies desire for <unk>  
why a cat  
<unk> give it a one  
okay so here is my presentation about technical function design  
yeah pitch at least  
good morning  
mm  
but we definitely if we have scroll things on the side we definitely have to have 'em labelled  
well the voice recognition has the main <unk> has another advantage  
but it's also like texting you don't  
we have to incorporate the lights too  
does it with with sax  
and that would actually look very nice yeah  
uh-huh  
um i've just got three sections first is the research i made on the on the remote control itself um  
we we might check with our r. and d. department to see if they have this product ready for market  
mm  
the  
continuum flux you can have  
does it work if i put in my email and uh  
or is it oh right  
i'm bad at math  
they were using like s. v. d. stuff singular value decomposition for that and it worked pretty well like i was surprised like  
um 'cause i think all the answers are gonna be run off the g. d. f. format 'cause 'cause we've decided that if we went and looked well if we're looking at dynamic reasons and whatever else  
okay  
so  
yeah  
and in the sense of <unk> with l. c. d.  
cool thanks  
but when you plug in when it's recording from microphone it records in mono  
two threes  
oh yeah  
but  
yeah  
sure looks smooth  
you're right it's two  
going very <unk> pragmatic uh there is a submission uh deadline for example thirty one december for conference on multi media and expo where i think these two little works on  
no but you started with <unk> hilbert envelope no  
i can see games happening  
yeah  
mm  
'kay  
definitely  
well not all  
but we have a vested interest <unk> profit sharing  
so we should get together probably in about four weeks yes  
so  
we can just query it  
so change  
it could be a meeting  
i'll just make it a little bigger now  
so  
see uh i i'm the one that uses the white board  
yeah nothing much in the project  
yeah  
<unk> that i'm not concerned with  
uh what what are gonna be the size because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on  
yeah  
so i i cannot design something without your agreement right  
what  
he only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail <unk> the living room  
i mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands  
<unk> you have to detect uh an event on one microphone and uh know when it's happened on uh on the other one  
this  
well i'm  
okay okay  
make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of  
i'll just  
yeah  
i'm sorry maybe you can do something if we are at your own place or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something  
know like yeah that is <unk> the <unk> airbag kind of thing  
just when you are one and you go to two you can or if you go to five you can go back to one with that button  
yeah i i i think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent <unk> choose the button so uh i think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality  
yeah  
so you you you can find examples which are not the web i think it's good to work in closed set  
uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot  
it's <unk> but it's not curved  
per hour one hundred and sixty eight  
so we just we tie uh <unk> just a very short x. m. l. file  
um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring  
um i mean what does everybody think about  
but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote  
but <unk> but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh  
yeah  
it <unk> visible visibility though 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery  
it would have to <unk> store up the energy  
where do you guys come up with these numbers  
because  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> yeah but but then you have it  
exactly yeah  
so yeah that's um those are the two important uh features i think we need on the remote  
so  
you could expect  
um and then seeing what comes out of that that might be useful for the meeting browser actually trying to say yeah  
mm-hmm  
change slide change <unk> which uh of course what i understood is also they try to recover the layout somehow  
yeah  
it might worth making making a <unk> part of the requirement for the g. d. f. stuff  
yeah  
alright  
and uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point  
'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours and with a lot of shape  
so that was my really my part for uh this session  
um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design  
yeah  
um and uh i dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not but anyway  
yeah  
no  
um  
well like um maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots  
yeah  
otherwise i am also much more available than i was  
flap yeah  
so do you need the difference between information and opinion to do this analysis  
a part of <unk> folder for the minutes maybe  
but  
i think it has  
and they get less uh complaints of r. s. i.  
i mean  
and so in the research that i was doing  
so technologically if i understand it uh t. v. <unk> t. v. <unk> working exactly the same way as video remotes and d. v. d. remotes  
no <unk> i didn't know  
t. r. i. k.  
so 'kay  
so the com the um the uh the <unk> is the following we don't go for speech recognition technology  
you could get the entire <unk> of the task out of a language  
something like 'cause we need a deadline for titles and a deadline for abstracts  
'cause if you don't you'll i'm sure you'll soon get an <unk> mail about it  
that is my  
and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
maybe a little less for your <unk> presentations and a little discussion  
mm  
or should be  
mm  
good thing plastic is free we're at eight  
hmm  
oh  
<unk> what was it again that i was supposed to look into  
we're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button  
problem comes here as you can see in the interface  
what's the op the option was maybe not to have rubber buttons but just to have the one that was soft and spongy and therefore  
um  
mm  
webbed <unk> oh right  
so we've now had to the three presentations  
only the experts  
like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste  
early new year gift  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and you have a file which has each word and a time stamp  
and did we make it a cherry officially  
and as far as i know that's it for me  
so we we must adapt to the to the receiver  
okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes  
mm  
so like one through five or  
yeah  
so let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet uh what kind of energy source uh i i we didn't speak about that  
yeah  
go  
how to say okay  
a a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their <unk> and <unk>  
okay  
okay  
so i mean so  
oh i see what you mean  
i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control because maybe parents will lose these uh  
hmm  
how many push button  
on  
mm-hmm  
special colour  
wind up  
and uh you and you and uh uh uh well think about requirements eh  
oh yeah we did our special colour for the line widths now that's a ten  
i will start to work on january on that point  
yeah yeah but the price is two  
machines to to to to put two <unk> uh space ships because it's it's known to work perfectly well or pentium  
yeah  
i have no idea  
so you'll so you'll know what they're replacing  
mm mm  
<unk> might be you just forgot the channel name you <unk> only know the number  
you would prefer it <unk> okay  
so true  
yes  
i yeah so in that respect i think we'll go with that respect  
the titanium thing uh  
so they have the speech coding standards again  
uh it it doesn't work well but but it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing  
yeah we do not want it in to develop a little tree display as well for multiple results  
oh  
um i still don't have any information about user requirements  
without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah it would be under two  
mm  
i see  
wouldn't that make uh arguments  
yeah  
i think that that's a good idea because you know that's one of the most important buttons  
that's it  
uh-huh  
hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
see the thing is  
and <unk> galaxies <unk> should be one you're right there  
yeah i'm sure he had to deal with that last year  
yeah  
interesting question  
'kay  
what have we done <unk>  
that was it  
yeah  
huh  
<unk> technical functions  
yeah  
the cost of that is very high  
so  
yeah yeah  
okay  
i'll briefly go through the uh  
right well  
but with different cards  
uh then the the the nine uh channels  
on and off  
well i mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah  
yeah  
so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition  
mm  
right  
okay so six is a  
yeah  
<unk>  
and uh  
maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that <unk> and then you could dispense with more otherwise  
<unk>  
in red whatever that is  
i'd assume like an internal light that comes through  
except that you're just going to give a different label to them <unk> depending on the context  
right so  
right and having personally worked with all these products uh i have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these  
mm  
'cause we don't wanna get into um working with <unk>  
it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t. v.  
mm-hmm  
mm  
every time  
yeah  
easy  
project <unk> project documents is for showing uh on the white board  
now  
yeah okay  
so the remote control has to be original trendy and um user friendly  
but readable enough of course  
um  
yeah  
when you got a regular button th the button of stand by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the  
we can just use this red  
right  
and then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up  
so should we expect that all the slides from like the work package six meeting or the joint work package five work pa will be <unk> up on one of the work package web sites  
and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative  
and as i was in increasing the number of slides which were affecting the the utterance i was re scoring um the performance was improving <unk> <unk> uh slightly  
yeah but they've been brought together in a remote  
it's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad  
yeah  
yeah you don't know how much it costs the l. c. d. screen  
'cause this is about the analysis  
ooh  
yeah one to one  
okay  
yeah maybe it's possible to have a list that it's <unk> that is ordered by  
mm  
so we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at  
i don't care  
thought that was interesting  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
i think ah you must see it as  
yes the the the there are changeable covers  
or just like you know really make it a quite abstract if that's fits in more with what we're doing  
yeah 'cause that's  
so it's something like a microsoft product update  
if you could uh  
what uh what did you wanna say  
yeah  
all the parts are unique  
is there anything have i forgotten anything  
be like a shell shaped remote  
and <unk> shape  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so we really have a incentive to make this remote work  
yeah okay  
maybe a can opener underneath it  
i mean if you have reversed question you have to reverse the scale uh yes  
not that one  
yeah  
yeah  
that cost less than eight pounds  
as we have voice recognition i think  
this this would be uh single curved uh  
yes  
it's a physical thing  
i'll tell to get it off my  
yeah yeah  
you know  
uh yeah he still yeah  
okay  
i think it has to be yellow  
well wonderful  
yeah  
and you have saved it  
hmm  
next is it easy to use  
and also in the in the u. s. a. the the current the <unk> the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy  
you know what the current state of the art in components is and some of the exciting new things they've got  
they had a hundred subjects and their <unk> lab and they watched them watch t. v. and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had  
so so the question would be under what tool should we be looking at these events  
okay  
you can move to the next slide so  
okay fine  
uh teamwork  
mm  
to like  
i think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has  
how you uh <unk> what you described uh just early  
and one is in in the america uh yes  
and also <unk> you know for mood lighting and and stuff that would be rather cool  
a new remote control for t. v.  
and this is uh  
yeah  
the uh remote control  
you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip  
okay  
and do we need a a logo on our uh remote control or  
and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on now can we do that  
listen with that that's that special but button you're talking about eh  
this is your real remote  
uh okay  
um okay so that would take away three which would give us  
uh okay  
and we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either we can stick with what we've already got  
you push the button to find it and it finds th the phone beeps for you  
uh there will be time for discussion  
okay  
mm  
yeah i don't like it  
yeah well i i was  
yeah  
the material used is spongy that that's uh that's a one that's <unk> rubber  
and so people say that they typically lose it as you yourself know because you probably lose your remote control all the time  
yeah  
oh  
yeah okay it's handy  
uh-huh  
so i guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were  
um i've done some marketing research a lot of interviews with remote control users um and some internet research  
so it'd look like this kinda  
but uh when you when craig re compiled it and did his new version it started <unk> <unk> it seems to work fine  
yeah  
um the current user uses his machine just about  
but that's done  
what about the integration of speech recognition  
instead of having three keys separately for four keys to model the <unk> will increase actually  
you can't put it out  
the first time so  
oh  
yeah it has yeah  
one question  
yeah so dave you said you need the frequency counts actually for per document would you say not for the whole thing  
so for instance if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five how would i do can i do that with this  
'kay  
and  
so i i think i think it's yeah  
i'm sure  
well business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image so yeah it needs colour  
okay  
alright  
uh no  
kinda like a beer glass  
yes  
you ha i you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh i figured that's a bit boring  
yes  
and buy the extra case  
nothing to add  
i think the tools that they were given the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration i think that's the word  
<unk> by my  
two  
yeah  
yeah  
alright  
mm-hmm  
draw really nicely over there  
i said that's the claim  
yeah uh i don't think that's a feature  
i i'm pretty confident that it'll just be writing a script and it will just go  
true  
galaxy with the galaxy  
i'm not sure if she did  
yeah just a lemon t. v. it'd be yellow lemon  
or  
yeah yeah  
because i see only my own presentation yeah  
yep  
yeah  
twenty two  
we can put it in it  
perhaps we <unk> done  
obviously there are some outliers so  
yeah got small writing  
yes  
yeah  
we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look and feel  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah extended emission is extended  
first one we can use simple battery or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic  
'cause you're not absorbing any new information and that's what the critical sort of deciding factor is  
oh i think no it's uh is it a scroll wheel and <unk> push button th this centre one  
in some cases we might if it's really tough we might be in need of a of some sound system to play recordings  
is it raid one has more compared to raid five  
looks like a pistol  
or i the distribution learned for every page has information incorporated in it from every other page's distribution as well  
like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink  
mm yes but  
mm-hmm  
i dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things  
uh furthermore buttons  
yeah  
alright  
he's crying but  
oh it's included beside mark it all as one entity yes  
the little r. r. yellow thing  
um i'm the user interface designer  
and um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room  
is that right  
yeah  
no  
i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of  
yeah  
well actually just to have the the <unk> <unk> uh possibly to to branch <unk>  
yes  
so i'll just have to have check that  
mm-hmm  
so if we do a sort of a one  
and as as per last time you'll get specific <unk> instructions from your personal coach <unk> mailed to you  
mm  
we're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance  
i mean maybe in terms of recognition it's zero point five percent  
yeah that's that is a thing  
okay let's start from the beginning  
has oh yeah do did have nah <unk> you have the black one  
mm  
otherwise they uh it's fully automatic  
i'll search um  
and a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co ordination of your finger on the screen  
you don't want to have ever have those problems and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable  
e. s. t.  
oh  
but  
no  
uh i mean you can bring your paperwork along and <unk> well of course if you have a lot of paper if you've if you've  
yeah  
yeah  
um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand  
there you go gun metal gray  
i assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control we can't kind of build it into other uh products  
well <unk> except for the surfing shape  
it just came out of nowhere  
mm-hmm  
no  
it this one is single curve  
if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not  
okay  
'kay who has most free space on their  
yep  
uh no no no  
okay  
tuesday colour  
yeah  
and um if you uh take the double curved uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll wheels  
okay okay  
i think it's a good idea yeah  
anyway  
okay we'll just say yeah  
and in fact yeah  
mm  
so mm  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
the only trick is the phase  
sure  
yep  
did she say circuit  
yep  
okay  
easy to learn  
mm  
something like this  
yeah  
hmm  
just after th mm-hmm  
but why do we need it  
and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery  
this is a <unk> well i was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect which is the technologically <unk> innovative um side of it  
um so these will be an important feature for clothes shoes and furniture  
yeah  
i always feel like first i wanna know what it looks like before 'cause if it's something really really small  
you need a docking cradle for example for you to put it in to charge  
and uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh l. c. d. screen to it it uh won't look anything like this but  
oh we decided upon that in the last meeting  
so it's fine  
uh so uh fancy look and feel what do you think  
mm  
yeah  
okay so we're definitely going for rubber  
yeah  
gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money  
mm-hmm  
limit again the the the use of certain materials because they would be too expensive  
like yeah  
hmm  
although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural  
oh  
yeah  
um right  
yes  
but i was just thinking it might be difficult to calculate the t. f. i. d. f. off line for all the different levels we might want  
you <unk>  
as soon as i get them now rather than i was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting  
uh th that that one  
yeah  
i wonder which level they are using out of what is there  
it's just exchange structure in this area that you're looking at and then that's a solid boundary between the next bit or something  
yeah  
oh yeah yeah we'll need that  
we can i can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um  
yeah yeah  
yep  
right  
so i think we should probably include the flat spectrum with your <unk> with your quasar is a very different from steep spectrum  
two  
so you cannot see them  
i'd i'd i don't think fruit and <unk> is the sole criterion  
but i have also a que  
twice  
no sorry <unk> one is true  
all these buttons and then they buy new t. v. because their previous one was stolen or whatever  
yeah yeah  
you <unk>  
i was thinking that the  
alright aye  
and what are just the <unk> buttons we have twelve buttons are you sure  
yeah  
and <unk> you know what they want and what are issues with with um existing products  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
i'm not i'm not a hundred percent sure what needs to be changed to make it work with the to make it not crash if it doesn't have a sound card  
yeah it is clear this  
i went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us  
yes  
your bag  
yeah  
we're not th actually throwing anything away  
i think a button  
but those things you can add like if you're really familiar with festival so you can add always these  
yeah  
that's basically the idea  
uh no we just use it as a scroll  
and um making sure that this can be feasible  
like a hidden panel  
yeah of course  
now  
i mean we didn't talk to them  
okay  
well i guess i mean  
like a like a mobile phone  
mm-hmm  
yeah well i think so  
okay  
<unk> big loop under the table  
it's not seven  
we need it to be seen  
but maybe i'm not trendy  
yeah  
it's a how can i present it  
so i'm not su so i'm not not sure if you wanna keep the mould or not  
thanks  
it's possible but it's it's not really much point  
uh this is the right segmentation for some of these but so but this is another point which for motion <unk>  
okay  
uh i mm-hmm  
yeah  
so here are options for our power sources  
mm  
so that is uh that is uh for both th  
yeah and our method is going to be provide simple  
in the basement  
alpha  
yeah it's just i mean it's it's exactly this thing but just i would i would just have to re scale this factor here  
uh i could not drag the pictures into the the slides so <unk> so i don't have examples of how it looks like  
the remotes that i've got  
yeah  
oh we get the general ideas yes  
so uh so for  
that's plastic  
user interface mike  
yep  
there are presentation  
i think it's done  
so you you finished it actually and so we just have to read it and say yes or no  
well i think it's a bit too much but  
um i'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting  
so you don't have to fiddle with that  
i don't think it  
but not let that confine us technologically  
yeah can we do some what ifs 'cause it may i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself  
yeah  
like like if if you look at uh if you look at your task and you see that i dunno uh  
yes but if it's if it's in a form which is easy to read in at the moment that would be fine  
maybe we could make one button to switch between d. v. d. player and t. v. and make the other buttons uh multi functional or something  
it's on your computer  
um and uh the i. d. and the u. i. d. need to work together on the prototype drawing on the <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
so for example at my f. zero um deviation  
an <unk> an <unk> and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that  
yeah  
yeah that's true  
there's no way you can integrate l. c. d. displays  
mm-hmm  
um we <unk> kept a adding things randomly  
yeah it's somewhere in here  
but if you can imagine that in like a <unk> just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic <unk> finish or something  
'kay i i think now that the <unk> clear  
because i think it will oh five minutes from to finish meeting  
uh yep  
to to switch <unk> uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a c. d.  
um so i'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder  
i don't have a problem selling a product that's not the issue  
mm-hmm  
once you have the fifty for each frequency you have uh the magnitude and the phase  
seven but  
more nice more kind  
okay  
so we wanted to have open possibilities  
when you hold on it it is comfortable to hold  
anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to  
i'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board  
yeah  
it's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana  
i don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station  
and galaxy  
right that's great  
okay  
well the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it so  
just  
<unk> well that  
and and then you'll get this type of display with that file  
think fruit and vegetable  
um so first of all just to kind of make sure that we all know each other i'm laura and i'm the project manager  
prepare to die  
production cost ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make  
i actually use one of those when they are they are kinda kinda troublesome  
and but of course you want these two streams to be <unk>  
better to draw with a with  
and the you know that that solves one of the problems of <unk> of battery life  
yeah <unk>  
so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever  
in terms of uh position  
i'm a little i am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote because that was kind of a big point  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
with j. p. fairly soon  
um is it a paper you can get  
um the only thing is with with the pull out panel that is can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface  
so for example you would um give a high value to those um sequences you want to display in the meeting series summary  
'cause yeah  
<unk> yikes  
yeah  
so um this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair um  
uh yes i have to look at the uh market potential for this product uh like consumer <unk> and everything  
um  
so you can when i tried and comparing with l. p. c. ten on a uh twice bigger or higher bit rate this work works better it seems to me  
can i get a cup of coffee  
yeah but it <unk> it doesn't matter because um if it's jumped to in the end text area  
how  
zero for the others  
'cause we've evaluated and we are within budget  
that not  
yeah i think the  
no then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make  
so it's not so bad  
so we should look at at what they are  
ideas for what people want  
definitely one  
not yet no  
and a new pen width uh also format  
yeah  
it is in th in in the base yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mean it's completely flexed i mean it it flexes to whatever they want it to  
so we'll market it that way too  
yeah  
is ah  
we don't need to have like the <unk> the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down  
thanks  
yeah definitely it's not optimum  
um forty minutes i believe is the time  
yeah  
yeah <unk>  
um but then you have you could either do it by raised type which could be you know iffy um sort of old fashioned in a way  
just cut  
let's see if that comes up  
if you think that that's something that you might want to look at in one of these tools that shows you the tracks against each other  
oh dear oh dear  
maybe with different type of fronts or uh well <unk> has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it we gonna skip back to the goals probably  
it's really like like a <unk> regular <unk>  
yeah  
can you reach that would be great thank you  
yeah my computer is not functioning properly  
i mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating  
okay so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to  
what  
people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out  
yeah  
yeah  
covers is covers is good  
that has to go as well then surely  
okay  
no no  
it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something you know  
well <unk> have to be  
well but i think we said that <unk>  
yeah  
of or the other way around uh  
cool  
test it out  
remote controls are often lost somewhere  
okay that's uh  
and it has specific to the environment and all that sort of thing  
yeah  
are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for  
yeah  
yeah well <unk> we can put functions in it when uh yeah when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it  
yeah i mean that wouldn't actually cost any more  
yeah  
you know is it just interactive and non interactive or is there are there there more grades of shading than that  
you're right  
maybe a little bit  
so yeah you need one one here and one on on the other side so you got volume an and channel  
<unk>  
mm  
like a phone yeah yeah  
i will speak about uh latest trends trends latest fashion updates and uh things we must not do  
yeah um what it actually does is that you you put in some documents and you have several documents per category  
wouldn't the <unk> the design we talked about  
so you <unk> so every time a part is added to the construct it becomes a new part  
okay  
eleven divided by <unk> one so equals average of one  
it's true that this blocks one of the one person rooms but uh on the other hand  
the original the very first one  
okay yeah  
yeah i understand what you mean  
yeah  
let's find out  
the look how it look like  
yeah  
yeah  
this is the first meeting uh for developing our our new product  
and the next one is i'll have to get it back up now  
i think that's more i think that's more durable anyway than printed on to  
'kay  
i mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds we could go for the fancy stuff  
oh  
unbreakable yeah  
it's use uh a lot of uh well well cell phones have uh integrated <unk> also and well it's it seems to work uh quite okay  
amazing  
and it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons including five <unk> set channels  
so what is that uh what would be the next possible direction you want to take  
okay  
uh does <unk> is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment  
f. five  
uh question number five  
right now it's just the idea of simplicity and <unk> cute and small um  
yeah  
so  
yeah  
it's pretty good  
well it doesn't actually make its way into its my salary i'm afraid  
it's plastic  
hmm  
yeah  
so now we we have the okay so ma <unk> will explain you the user interface there  
<unk>  
no that's true  
no no no no no no  
or hard uh hard plastic  
and it will just string them all together with maybe i don't know tenth of a second silence in between each one or something like that  
it's in in in some way it can give us an advance because you will save on your batteries  
i think it's a nice idea to make it more <unk> that the next to the logo you have the slogan  
you could imagine it to <unk> like be in all in all the contexts  
mm  
i mean uh and uh that's why we have it here right so that  
rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually  
yeah  
one point eight isn't it or something  
yeah  
if you hear some click  
yeah  
<unk>  
well maybe  
well  
we're saying per unit  
yeah so  
yeah  
it's in a in a way that <unk> is user friendly  
uh they don't do any slide  
okay  
so what is the <unk> standard now  
oh yeah yeah that's true  
it'd be verbal plus action  
they're really at the same place  
yes yes is it like that  
it consists of three phases namely the functional design conceptual design and detailed design  
this  
well we should wait till we have it ready for um you guys to use  
well i don't know  
well you can make profit with them and it's a way to make them trendy  
after that we have <unk> thirty minutes for work  
yeah one  
yeah  
we can wind up  
yeah  
um so <unk> from the  
yeah  
what exactly we're looking for here  
in the eighties  
functional design perspective um <unk> i <unk> we can now uh know <unk> what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other  
though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is we might need to have some kind of inner frame  
and it becomes construct or assembly whatever two  
yeah  
uh  
we'd expect that if we put people under time pressure they'll look at the clock a lot more  
yeah  
new  
and again i mean this is a question  
yeah  
can't use titanium  
alright  
but in frequency domain there is a overlap  
yeah they have that little solar  
another remote control slightly different it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions  
i i think <unk> i i think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie  
maybe in the middle again three or four or something  
oh that's alright  
um so hopefully you've all been working away and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder  
we only actually needed one computer  
yeah  
a it <unk> it has it it has a that's <unk> th th shape that it fits your hand  
and uh we closed as it ran out of time  
okay well it's time uh for some discussion  
yeah i mean do they is that something they want actually written on it 'cause it's quite long  
which is over seventy percent of our market is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old  
but banana is not so handy i think that's <unk>  
okay but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh <unk>  
two  
i think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings screen settings and channel settings but as sub menus  
um  
yeah  
but i'll just draw a different kind of dog  
okay it's uh decline  
the <unk> the rate i think it's better to do it without l. c. d.  
it doesn't have to be a real trial  
so it can also from this angle it can flip all the way up to there  
we had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool  
is he gonna define this kind of building sequence in a way that we can get out  
um  
since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics  
weird  
yeah the new thing in the paper and well some  
or what was it i. d.  
oh <unk> i would smart board  
it it can travel <unk> from clothe to furniture same idea  
so these are my views  
um the interface contents  
okay then  
so  
possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones  
yeah i mean i'm it doing it for all of it  
yes  
yeah  
yeah  
we're wicked  
that's  
what do you think  
okay  
okay  
i like the <unk> the different shapes of the buttons and stuff  
uh  
yeah  
okay  
it would be like going a step back in time  
instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know so <unk> so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore  
oh okay the ipod thing yeah  
yeah  
um because if if it is then i think voice um voice activated  
but because we need to shed what was four euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired  
it has to be uh yeah  
uh it's  
it uh there are a lot of options there so we can really make uh yeah how do you say  
energy over length is power  
alright  
cool okay  
so uh zapping uh should be very easy  
oh i've read  
but you no specific uh views for mountains or old town or i mean people prefer any windows  
hmm  
um so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples  
um  
so it's it's also like doing along along the diagonals all again  
yeah this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro  
yo  
it's it's just uh  
you  
i mean i think off hand thinking about this model it would have to work better because two things in the same category are going to be linked  
it can be operated with the same set of buttons yeah  
and uh that much money will be required for the base station which is not there  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
uh and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half euro  
okay  
smaller and smaller yeah yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your t. v. and remote controls  
different setups  
then we the same  
it's a bit nineties maybe what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point  
alright  
yeah  
and on this one you could have a large value  
it can be stored  
yeah  
um the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them you know neutral  
well management would like it  
like it's it's referencing here it's referencing to  
hmm  
yeah  
only thirteen euros  
course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour  
if if i  
i would say  
i think  
in the basement  
then it doesn't matter  
uh  
on the side i've done some single channel work which can maybe help  
yeah  
but uh if we decide to go on a <unk> uh um l. c. d. screen we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set  
um defined in some them  
and it sounds better for some kind of speech signals  
yeah it  
um there's a problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control um i get 'em with the the red colour button for stand by and <unk> the other examples of that um  
and uh yeah  
'kay  
uh yeah and <unk> that's yeah  
yeah  
okay  
it isn't in my information so i don't know it uh either  
mm-hmm  
uh <unk> no  
so you could on their <unk> you could on their <unk> create a score like for each for each of their segments  
okay  
so  
oh and save this uh board  
so that's <unk>  
you agree  
huh image  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
it has to have big user friendly buttons and <unk> <unk> definitely we wanna be inspired that the current  
and then uh you know <unk> for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the <unk> the look  
there there's a so you so so you appreciate you appreciate the cost of  
on this normal  
uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device  
mm  
is it doing  
and but what if uh maybe this this board uh <unk> is malfunctioning or someone  
for yeah  
i think it does very well  
that you estimate actually using a number of lines  
so yeah  
okay yeah  
i dunno where to put it 'cause the  
yeah or <unk>  
what percentage of time is given to looking where the other guy is looking  
yeah  
huh  
um one interesting thing is that these numbers are not uh arbitrary things  
okay  
eleven or twelve  
it sounds great  
yeah  
right  
i think it is  
um yeah  
so either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable  
mm 'kay  
well so we hope  
uh  
i don't know what the se the basic colour is though  
ah it's not necessary to have it maybe  
this is just experience that um if anything can screw up it will  
i i uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have our company  
i mean that's that's a description of the type of data  
yeah the side exactly the sideways  
nice  
at least for male females  
uh i think our customers will go insane  
oh yeah alright  
but when we want a <unk> wheel <unk> we also need the expensive chip so can we use same chip so with one expensive chip  
yeah that's fine  
just make it an option in menu ins install powerful profiles or something  
mm-hmm  
right  
of course i'll buy the banana  
yeah  
mm why  
does it will so it will be a two point five  
oh can you  
so um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add  
yeah  
okay  
no uh <unk> no  
welcome to the meeting everyone  
do we have an idea of costs of different components  
they're very cheap  
yeah  
some of them admit of multiple parties and some of them assume you're in one speaker's head  
even line if it is line width  
in the base or in the actual remote  
and could you put that in the group folder  
yeah okay  
wait  
mm-hmm  
okay  
well that all sounds good  
maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels  
um  
but  
is there much more in it than he <unk>  
just some ideas that i had um energy source  
okay  
it's loading your data i'm not quite sure is this it probably looks like <unk> data from from the looks of it  
okay  
because battery changing is usually okay  
bright <unk> hard to lose  
yeah so we should also implement se screen settings  
yeah  
with one thing special  
yes  
yeah  
senior citizens uh  
right  
certainly for now yeah  
curved  
yeah yeah  
'kay  
alright  
i want uh to list all the programme tonight  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so thank you  
come up with the same same kinds of yeah  
so would it be easy slash <unk> difficult slash impossible like at the moment if we skip to a <unk> treating a whole series as one thing  
so what we'll do i mean the thing is the the main call will go out before she's got round to it anyway  
but <unk> you can have uh of course different between d. v. d. <unk> and televisions and between  
yeah yeah yeah  
so it says if we make a slightly more fancy then we lose points innovation  
yeah  
uh i just took one for every step and then a conclusion  
okay  
a single curved  
<unk> and slightly organic then i think <unk> too  
well this is you can buy or you can order for free on internet  
minimal  
uh yeah i ca i ca i could i could show you  
yeah  
so  
wouldn't give it more  
i mean  
oh <unk>  
i think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker  
mm-hmm  
yeah well by by the by the time by the time they're doing that they must have already broken something  
it changes it maybe  
i think the logo would definitely be <unk>  
using the remote control ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels and that's for flickering through channels  
mm  
and <unk> how uh how do you want to go about it  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
we should do it  
jose he man is  
um i already took the liberty to make some suggestions  
'kay  
right  
it's a horse  
i mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television  
but uh we <unk> were thinking for example of a task like um trying to uh see if uh where a speaker is talking i mean if the speech is actually correlated with the slides uh where the slides uh which happen during the not correlated  
yeah yeah  
that's that thing  
um  
and you true or false  
okay  
but do can your can the department make  
it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime because it's too many buttons and so on  
mm  
yeah  
yeah they've been cut out the ones that don't have any words  
yeah  
the very rare blue zebras  
we went through the use of wheels and but buttons  
zapping you know zapping  
that might just so  
good  
right okay um  
the information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or  
and <unk> uh titanium is uh is is it a no  
it could be like this  
oh yeah well that'll take forever  
but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you  
well i had basically  
so so you already hear like <unk> suppose this is full signal you're already here  
i mean think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example  
okay  
um <unk> <unk> <unk> da is you mean on the plastic or  
yeah  
i haven't heard referred to since  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
it's not just uh straight  
we didn't bring it up yet or at all in the meetings so far  
so no l. c. d. no teletext and no voice recognition  
so we need to know how much data you need hand <unk>  
no  
well i don't think we should remove the button because there are always people who are using it  
yeah  
because um when when uh when i use a remote i <unk> i hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom  
yeah  
this is basically what people are accustomed to so  
yeah  
and which which colour should uh should i give the the display  
i'm not sold on this it's pretty dear i mean twenty <unk> that's like you know  
but then there's the rest of p. p. l. s. and i think we need to decide whether  
yep  
uh yeah  
what kind of user <unk> interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that  
yeah  
it's related to the number of microphones around  
just going  
i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision  
yeah  
anyway yeah  
oh  
um uh okay  
right  
there's i think the only constant people are susan maggie andre  
okay  
we have four types  
i mean so far i've got um on and off um switch the channel up and down and put the volume up and down  
um so the youngest age group fifteen to twenty five  
yep  
mm single curves  
yeah  
unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side  
or some bump  
combined with the low cost circuit board so it's uh  
but it was based on like you were using kind of <unk> there right  
mm-hmm  
um so i'd give the company strategy  
then we looked at the components um  
don't it in include the derived property  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
so i have no idea how the booking system works  
oh yeah yeah  
yeah  
it's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something  
uh well what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared not like all probably know  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
microsoft though  
is  
mm-hmm  
up we go there and this is um in fact it's a perl programme that outputs in <unk> instead of <unk> h. t. m. l. or text it outputs uh j. peg  
um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than <unk> rather than buttons  
yeah  
for the first yeah  
um think of it <unk> kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete  
great  
okay adjusting  
<unk> with this paper it's too mu too expensive  
you go ahead  
yeah  
so it gives them much more flexibility and allows them to be where they want to be  
periodic pulse yeah  
<unk> <unk>  
okay the <unk> i mean the other <unk>  
okay  
save  
well i think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the <unk> and the volume buttons  
it's probably worth mentioning this to the to the guys in the garage in toronto right  
but if we all have a think when we go away from the meeting  
it's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty  
okay but it's okay  
yeah you have <unk> you use this one  
um  
so  
dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun  
<unk> yeah  
um you  
but anyway um we might come to that later  
but well as you saw that hadn't made no sense because we had to drop it  
i think we have to go for the first one  
yeah  
we have tactile buttons  
hmm  
it is it is jumping now  
yeah but then you don't have <unk> yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time  
we'll just say three  
okay  
mm-hmm  
that's that's true  
uh  
so basically um in order to save our two euros  
so um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um  
does anyone does anyone know in which file the actual like what's it called the splitting into the utterances  
<unk> uh do you want to mention your speech coding experiments  
five  
and uh this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a v. standing for the volume  
and the <unk> the light blue and it's also in yellow  
well it's not quite so essential apparently although i don't understand how it couldn't be um and everything else  
uh okay so  
the production price twelve and a half euros approximately  
wasn't it interesting that um i thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um  
but yeah  
no uh three or yeah  
mm-hmm  
alright  
think  
so if they're noisy that could disrupt the quiet of the lounge  
sure  
from up there  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
just one colour okay  
oh well they're probably away then  
so the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase  
okay  
a volume okay  
yep  
alright  
hmm  
because if we know sort of this is going from word to word or it this is going from time to time and then there has to be a way then for you say okay  
'cause there's quite often lots and lots  
all all buttons  
oh  
maybe we <unk> that should be sold in in the <unk> in stores with with a standard cover or something  
mm  
well they they just bought a mobile and based on the o. s. it's using they they they developed the software  
i think oh give us the <unk> and something on your screen  
line comes out and and should come out as well  
i <unk> love that one  
no  
on the lower side i think it you have to turn it  
hmm  
controlled by a brain huh  
mm  
exactly  
that's true  
we have to make one design i th i i think  
so uh yeah  
uh  
well you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds they'll still remember it  
yeah  
to the automated topic topic segmentation  
<unk>  
then we uh won't <unk> uh go further with it  
uh uh it's uh it's uh it's yeah  
and uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes  
yeah okay  
okay  
i i <unk> i especially uh liked the the means the the <unk> and uh  
yeah  
well i will draw what i had drawn on the screen  
oh there we go  
and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing  
'cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten  
broke  
i don't feel strongly about it  
mm-hmm  
yeah i like that yeah  
can we see the white board on our laptops  
well maybe not but  
um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television  
yeah  
yeah  
what's the first thing we should drop  
but what did we decide  
i wonder what button i press  
okay  
i don't know how much that's going to uh  
yeah but  
so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote  
oh good idea  
yeah you make a screen menu or something  
it was yeah  
so what do you want to do with that  
so maybe that's a possibility but i'm afraid it will be a bit costly  
yeah  
yes <unk> there there will be a <unk> a little a little p. on that and a little uh yeah  
yeah  
uh if we do next  
added extras would be nice but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window  
okay  
yeah  
that were designed for dialogue right i mean and can be expanded to more than two persons  
fifty per cent  
hmm  
well we can still design a two piece uh remote um without having a base having one of them be a base station  
that's right yeah yeah  
no i didn't do it myself  
simplification so  
'kay  
mm  
okay  
so that was it for me  
as a profit  
if um he he asked me all you know could i <unk> segment the slides for him uh  
so basically what decisions uh have we uh made  
so this is the technical functions design  
yeah  
you want to see now  
and also when it's was uh going uh the idea was appearing and  
so that's like another <unk> um i mean these are three examples sort of looking at it  
yeah  
this is your problem  
uh  
i what  
i mean obviously we can just abandon this it's fine  
so that was just just an idea i had  
mm  
yeah  
yeah but what kind of features  
so you have to keep that side flat  
well that's <unk> what i'm <unk> pondering really  
a very simplified cow  
uh yeah  
mm  
yeah  
yeah buttons will be on the upper side lower side we will just put the casing  
mm-hmm  
you get these very bizarre results because the data is not really very good  
yeah you'd have to count it yourself yeah  
it's <unk> hmm  
they'll kick into this battery so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery  
i don't mind running it  
mm-hmm  
that's all here here it says  
people want an easy to use device  
yes he's he's been <unk> emailed it yeah  
yeah  
welcome  
i don't think that uh just a <unk> a little light  
he's happy with us so uh  
maybe a spanish name would work well  
no  
uh  
it's better  
draw  
yeah  
so for the first one we need to decide did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote  
mm-hmm  
yes  
and if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product  
it's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper  
it's come in under budget  
so it's more of course this will look like a bone then  
okay uh  
okay  
or  
and then there is the f. d. l. p.  
yeah if yo  
uh i was thinking about four so i think three is uh  
they could be <unk> initially i thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand held  
you can have as many of these as  
she was allowed emission from high excitation what not  
yeah  
and that yeah  
yeah could be grey  
okay  
and uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design  
right  
yeah that's true you should i think the <unk> the power button should be on top 'cause it's the first thing you do turn it on  
not i'm not saying i'm not saying that there's a particular set of tags or relations that have been defined out there that are the right ones  
it's it <unk> it <unk> goes it's not the best we could do i guess  
was it was it fifty or five  
yeah  
and on the back of it have the logo  
i guess no um  
yeah  
yeah mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the  
okay  
point point four million  
uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used  
yeah  
um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme  
mm-hmm  
so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength  
yep  
and um they also like uh familiar material uh especially wood  
the user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly but that's pretty obvious i think  
but it's quite uh advanced and it's  
there so that <unk> basically what i've got is well there there there's places where you got the i. d. though  
but it's not just absorption point five k. v.  
and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip but also very sleek and  
yeah yeah  
uh it hardly ever wastes any resources  
fifty million was uh <unk>  
i haven't got message  
well i i if if you want if you want the blinks <unk> merged into a fixation  
two is okay  
so was there result  
no uh well the agenda says evaluate now so i think we  
it's not really english  
yeah  
no  
so  
are they not ordered or oh yeah from w. fifty two down to w. what are we talking about  
okay so it could be you you would have to publish the results on this standard task  
yeah  
two  
what what the algorithms are still coming up with is in this way you're looking at a clustering of marbles yeah  
may be incrementally emitting but yeah  
and the source can be a noise signal or it can be some uh sequence of uh what is that  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top  
in fact i don't know  
um should have interchangeable <unk> so people can <unk> it um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms  
mm-hmm  
and it's also more fun yeah  
i a <unk> a v. l. p.  
but they like dark colours you said in the <unk>  
and then it that basically  
we put it out  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah  
okay  
yeah  
kendra anyone  
it's quite a high bit rate  
and fire wire gives you some um some way to be <unk> in fact  
hmm  
or i won't send anything to philosophy and informatics till i've got your email  
i can rope people in to to doing it a few people at least  
um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x. obviously go with it  
the groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay  
<unk> how well these particular prototypes work uh <unk> find out what people think of 'em  
well out of this one we like you know the round section of um <unk> or we'd like the the button size on this  
well for me it's i think we uh it's fine  
mm  
mm  
mm  
this is it  
different colours  
so these are the different options that we have  
if you have a lemon lemon t. v. for  
well  
between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software  
no but  
mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
just give it a name and we call him  
right  
hmm  
like it might be necessary for a t. v. but not for the remote <unk> you know  
yeah  
so that people with uh with  
yeah i think  
yeah and since you're holding it like this i suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah  
its own button on the front  
say fruit and vegetable colour scheme but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours  
it's meant to be one yeah i don't know why i put two in there  
but it's a strength rather than abundance  
current trends  
okay  
okay  
nobody uses teletext very much anymore so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control  
okay  
we we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse with which you can change uh and so if you  
wow <unk> why no li look at now we got two  
let's see  
yellow in the back because it's <unk> trendy more trendy than black anyway  
no you don't have to  
like it it's a very it gives you like i've looked at the result  
um students are there  
yeah  
<unk> in my opinion we should have only useful thing and because apparently they want the simpler it's is better  
it's quite logical al all of it  
option for key frame extraction okay  
draw it  
ah it's okay  
yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive yeah  
pitch isn't is not enough sometimes  
but from the side it's it's flat and the screen screen is just well you just have to hold it like this then  
well you know it's it's handy it's ergonomic but it's a banana  
can you make the promise even i'm not making the promise realistically that the girls will very soon get  
or it could be like this as the people say if they have a l. c. d. on the remote not on the television  
temporarily simplify too much so that yeah  
uh according to the coffee uh machine example i have batteries to supply energy  
but will give you if you look at your table uh what we have developed here  
three euros  
no that's the <unk> dried  
well thing is that with  
okay let's oh how much of <unk> are we putting in  
and th the last thing here was a an l. c. d. screen  
um but the buttons on this i think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons  
yeah  
i didn't have it <unk> uh haven't brought it  
oh yeah  
yeah  
because i know at the end of when i'm done watching t. v. that when i'm done  
but  
you can still play with it then i guess  
so like when you say change except that's being said quite a lot on t. v. so maybe like you know remote  
and they were then  
next time  
be careful  
but they're they used to implement all these <unk> g. s. m. and i. t. u. standards  
um well from the point of us developing it it doesn't really make much difference  
yeah you made up  
okay  
then you hold it in your hand like this  
so  
but i mean i've no real idea how that works  
um  
i don't need the <unk>  
yeah two or a one i guess  
yeah  
it's not uh fully real time so uh watch it  
well uh yeah i i'm gonna do something right there yeah  
no problem  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um i think the important points we have to <unk> talk about are uh it's functional design it's conceptual design and <unk> detailed design  
hmm  
yeah  
my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things and i don't know how to work half of them um  
oh is this <unk> to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay  
okay  
okay  
thanks for your attention  
and i would think  
no time on  
but yeah  
huh  
um  
well the old the old tasks are the best  
you can have the video and audio stored separately  
i'm pretty sure i'm top  
yeah  
anybody have anything to offer  
energy source i think we've i think we've decided batteries although not exciting are probably our best bet  
um so i want the controller to be easy to use but with sophisticated functions  
if you have all of them all the old and new t. v. <unk> summed up so uh i think uh it is possible  
yeah that's also  
and maybe with uh graphs or i don't know uh user interface designer you could maybe uh help us on that  
right  
and we can apply some other technique for that you know  
ha  
just um somewhere  
yeah it was s. t. l. p. was called <unk> transform linear prediction  
so the <unk>  
okay  
um it's already uh oh we have a blank  
yeah  
but we'll have parameter for that  
but but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course  
the power device is is i i is very cheap  
when you use it your remote like once a day or maybe even less i i it  
okay  
um it's only for the television which i'm presuming means it's for a specific television  
yeah a few variables  
so we <unk> would need a value label for each of those segments that are not dialogue acts  
yeah yeah  
you would say like good morning <unk> and it would respond good morning jill but  
how can we make it trendy or something  
and the difference in the history of construction right is an important thing and i wonder how we can get that information back  
you will do the evaluation  
and that's a pity if you uh if you have uh thirty forty minutes uh for this kind of things  
thank you  
mm  
and then we the speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put in we may k. i. v.  
so it uh should be technologically innovative like glow in the dark or speech recognition something like that  
so it's obviously a dialogue  
yeah  
oh  
so in my opinion the  
that wouldn't they wouldn't let that pass  
mm 'kay  
we did a training set didn't we and then compared to see  
i think i'd be surprised if we got sort of four out of them  
'kay  
or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody  
no  
i don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but  
um and you know as as external fashions change then we get new new covers on the market and you know readily available  
yeah it  
and um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty euro per remote  
we could meet up and have a session  
right  
um he's a mixture of uh various things  
we're really having just push button interface  
um the three presentations  
so uh we discussed an  
well i can't get no satisfaction but uh i think it's uh well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best yeah  
yeah the see at the moment the dialogue i. d. <unk> just they start at zero for each meeting they don't run um continuously  
you see this beautiful presentation  
like that that's not that important of course  
yeah ma ma uh <unk>  
they believe that children uh are influenced by the television and uh well we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years  
press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well i was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession  
we have two smart boards  
okay  
mm  
and we've got a student starting in january who's gonna start working on on how to actually efficiently <unk> the um the h. m. m. yeah yeah  
more complexity and it probably just won't give us any brownie points in the presentation  
and it's very important  
mm  
i agree  
um  
you you you seemed to hesitate a bit  
mm-hmm  
we could put those on display  
the compression number of bands and lengths of the so what you what you were playing with and what other result  
and on my personal preferences i don't have any mo more time to come with that but like i said  
so um  
so no we're not doing d. v. d. we're not doing anything else it's just gonna be a television remote  
uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best  
<unk> circuit  
at least uh what we should also have on i just remembered um a menu to go back through the first uh  
right  
uh yeah at the back  
yeah age sixteen forty <unk> interest in main features more critical  
uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button like mobile phone  
the response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited  
uh furthermore uh material that's your part should be very strong  
sony  
mm-hmm  
okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card  
that i don't know  
is that a good idea  
uh i'm not quite sure how to make that but i'm sure it will work  
yeah  
and then when you in the menu  
okay we all ready to go  
yeah  
if you  
the base the charging base with rechargeable batteries  
so uh i think i have to finish that page  
they're more expensive though too  
that's  
so too bad we don't have any finance information apparently  
okay  
i bet <unk> just talked to 'em  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but that's another representation then i think <unk> for the importance measure  
yes  
or can we  
um something easy to use you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way like with fruit and vegetable  
now basically we have all this kind of general view about all the systems maybe we can take this opportunity to come back to our system  
yeah it's that one and this one here  
hmm  
okay  
shall we  
if if you want to like read full text then you can say like the full text  
technical functions  
yeah  
okay  
mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want  
yeah  
okay  
some a little white  
okay so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control  
iron and absorption  
a and an end time  
and then um if i send it out tomorrow we'll say something like the el  
yeah okay  
yeah  
people say this is a cut this is not a cut but like for dissolve even sometimes  
not yet  
is it rude  
it's impossible  
th they are used to use it when they can see the t. v. so i don't know  
thank you  
so so probably we can yeah  
well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale as following  
um this is sort of an example of going for a <unk> certain demographic  
does anyone have a preference for going first  
so next slide please  
the voice recognition thing is cool  
<unk> two functional design options  
okay here's a space  
so i'll i'll double check the g. d. f. specification against that just to make sure it's got everything you said that you'd you say you need from that list  
so <unk> we can maybe even start to cut down on or i was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use  
f. five  
no  
and i don't <unk> also it's also really not innovative it's more  
mm  
well most i think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey  
um and you have  
technical problems  
yeah  
and uh 'cause then they don't have to <unk> they don't need special colour as well  
right  
um  
oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under  
i'll close 'em down  
okay  
hmm  
if you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out yeah  
usually at the top  
uh yeah well i think so also  
mm  
<unk> oh so we could meet at five and i have the display code ready by then  
hmm  
so when it gives you the kind of answer you get is that okay to go in that in that direction maybe is not the best thing  
and then lastly i thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition  
emission from high excitation lines  
mm-hmm  
well they gave me um an idea about what people want  
and um <unk> maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do  
what was i to say more  
aye that would be a good idea  
so  
mm  
and uh the the children think oh this is my remote control uh i made a picture on it  
mm  
because yours would sort of give just the segment i. d. <unk> and mine would give the start segment i. d. <unk>  
i think you should make it more vegetable like  
just uh clips of <unk> that you record yourself  
but you can have you can ask for a student a <unk> a diploma work  
mm  
what what are the costs  
um  
uh  
yes  
why not  
no  
and of course the four arrows  
are you okay  
but  
oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in <unk> our target group i think  
four  
i can't remember actually  
but uh i i i personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model  
how did you cope with what you mentioned some time before  
rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say and then  
um so we need to make sure that <unk> even with the joystick  
with <unk> various lengths we were trying to to start them from from on the ultimate length of one one uh frame up to one second or even more  
uh no that did not come up at all  
'kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button haven't we  
right the there was no um damped l. y. alpha something  
yeah  
so uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um  
well the the well that's a reason to to to put the l. c. d. screen uh of course on the upper side but  
yeah  
here the uh financial objective of our project  
i don't think that's applicable because  
mm-hmm  
mm uh uh it's <unk> uh <unk> um a avril has ordered them from somewhere possibly  
depends on the screen  
alright  
and and here that you use only for test so this is your  
that's me  
so you have  
for example i dunno here escape you know you have escape in computers you have  
the user interface controls um of course we have the push buttons and uh we also have scroll wheels  
it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it but again th it's it's swings and <unk>  
just cut off the <unk> yeah  
i think it's exact the same thing when <unk>  
and i mean how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon  
right  
well i was gonna start off i've <unk> got sort of half way through implementing one that does just i. d. f.  
i'm the user interface designer  
maybe when i put on  
and they're not so great to dispose of environmentally  
doing the marketing  
yeah  
yeah that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it  
so maybe you can go ahead  
mm-hmm  
red for power um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not  
mm-hmm  
because it do doesn't have to flip then  
uh  
fruity loops  
yes  
google  
yep  
yes  
um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that  
um i was i was getting that <unk> actually sorry i was getting that wrong i was getting it from what i did my project  
we also that you're just busy with it  
wow maybe i should market it to some remote control company now  
let's let's have party  
paint it  
so  
where part of it's useful  
um now programming it actually <unk> this is one thing i've found with um the replacement remote control  
yes  
channel is just up and down  
okay so no time button  
yay  
okay  
okay  
ten years  
and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod where that one way <unk> through channels that way th other way through channels  
um so so far just to recap you've got volume and channel control and  
yep  
they know her  
well  
no  
yeah  
or even just the entire corpus  
ah yeah  
uh we need somebody to develop that  
we have a a basis um how do you call it  
so would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things  
yeah  
yes  
it's  
and i found a good few examples where you had a site that looked uh well one that i remember off hand was it was a page and it was a big picture  
yeah  
right okay okay  
and then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time forty minutes  
flat spectrum  
yeah  
two  
yeah but we we going to yeah yeah that's true  
yeah i think so too  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> that sort of assumes that we think it's better to do this by deriving chunks from um some parsed format than just hand <unk> the stuff  
mm  
do you know <unk> are <unk> are we um so at the moment the configuration is that word importance file is test three and t. d. i. d. f. file is test two  
yeah  
it depend if you had so a bunch of people all just giving information and opinion around the table and they never actually ask questions of each other  
a banana shape  
or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged  
um format  
you should probably speak  
so and uh that's uh that summarize well what i have said  
and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work  
but the ex  
think  
makes sense makes sense  
yeah you can yeah you can be very picky about it  
uh the <unk> the actual design  
no it's it's uh it's okay  
hmm  
people change channels people they change the volume and they they change channel they turn t. v. off and on for example  
i didn't even read those  
yeah or we can <unk> do the kinetic cells  
uh i is it just uh more detail uh as i understand it  
um that's a speaker at the top so you can speak into it like a little walkie talkie as well for speak recognition  
yeah  
okay  
these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that  
yeah  
it's basically like a just a long <unk>  
um and what do i like about him um that's just to suggest that his tail wags  
you'll you'll know all too well what was said in this meeting by the time you  
mm-hmm  
so we have to safety point of view also we have to take care  
if they're not still <unk> on it when they come back out of the blink then  
possibly even a five  
yeah well maybe because of the cost but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh  
yep  
so i'm gonna give it a smiley face  
the i mean just like the more advanced it is  
yeah below forty  
just few words like so but if for or something  
i've not got it reading in the topic segments yet  
so does anyone have any overall  
um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off  
do you know what i mean  
but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we <unk> the um the uh voila  
maybe you can <unk> okay  
oh mm no  
well this is all your department  
well yeah that's the thing  
and i think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new  
when you scroll  
yeah  
so this is uh one of the the possibilities that were offered to us  
mm neither have i  
yeah  
yeah but there is no colour here  
true  
cool  
yeah but uh  
i have no idea so  
but they're actually sort of carrying on the sentence do you have to <unk> each time you transcribe a bit if it's mid  
yeah  
<unk>  
and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier okay  
people can change it every month  
um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations  
this is this is the stuff that i can use to okay  
look and feel and  
you know we don't wanna a big <unk>  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
mm  
wait  
right that's okay  
yeah  
but this is given a gaussian space it maps that down into the simplex of what a topic can be about  
uh it's a. c.  
yeah  
so i'm currently looking what is available on the web  
but then there's a kind of awkward question of where we put first years because they don't need to  
you know to change the channel or to uh turn the t. v. on and off  
and  
so that's that i guess  
i don't think it would take that long anyway  
there's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button  
yeah  
uh that finished  
yeah  
hmm  
<unk> how does that work  
did you say one rose  
so we can uh just uh  
uh just something else i need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote  
when you need you can use it and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing  
but if you were looking at say this one so only went like this  
five minutes left  
mm  
um  
yeah  
or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism  
okay  
so i think there should be a prefix to some numbers  
then next week you're planning on recording  
including price do you have any idea about price or other features  
to make it as uh as round as possible  
and i think if we're to <unk> our view of what we want in a remote control we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics  
the right  
we're now including nebula aren't we  
this uh  
no no no  
and it's fabulous  
seems to be useful  
oh god why is it doing that  
ah yes it was the second one  
yeah yeah  
yeah i think you should add  
um i'll show you  
<unk>  
i'm sorry but you still don't answer to my my question  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh make a new blank sheet  
often in the form of infrared bits  
well  
yeah  
what happens if we do  
so i just put all those components in  
yeah  
and especially notice that uh the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board  
sometimes it's a lot more  
yeah that's effectively what i'm getting here  
is that an implicit request for me to do something  
they'll be like say something british and you're like oh shut up family  
alright so no button for that  
the fronts <unk> you can do anything with them  
um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which i i quite like having on the controls  
yeah  
uh first i think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries  
uh we uh we were busy with that  
yeah  
so it looks like a big screen but in fact it isn't  
what should be um  
do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls  
so something like that  
so um  
mm-hmm  
so why not on your remote  
so that's  
two more things  
it's difficult to lose it  
yeah in the middle  
to you  
'kay guys lot of success  
yeah  
so th <unk> that is really simple like so what he does is like so he he computes the residual  
i put the minutes on the i made on the on the <unk> the the project share so if you wanna review them they're there  
i'll give it another go  
yeah  
i mean why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway  
because i'm only using three or four channels but  
yeah that's what i meant actually yeah  
because it would then say how it find that it's that speaker  
do we we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something right  
yeah  
i uh have found some interesting things  
are you serious  
okay so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting thank you very much indeed  
u. c. l. a.  
i i i assume you were finished here  
since it's not feasible to add a cable to that  
all set  
mm  
alright  
yeah th thank you  
so be attractive to look at  
okay  
sure  
yes  
oh okay  
oh yes why not  
okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so  
that's it  
so so the idea is to help them <unk> <unk> their own work  
mm-hmm  
how many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh <unk> uh <unk> only five minutes left by the way  
so so that whatever he's whatever he's been doing uh is not uh forgotten and then people can stay on his shoulders and uh i hope that he won't get out entirely out of uh out of uh this problem  
you can place the screen here which can come  
hmm  
to <unk> to <unk> lock it  
<unk>  
experience with remote control first ideas  
but um so they uh yeah i think the mouse is slightly bigger but it's not you know it's not it's not hugely bigger  
and general opinions about current current remotes  
and l. c. display  
uh-huh  
yeah  
because i i tried you know those th those papers  
which is a a plus for us if we can make it look better it'd be uh  
right  
mm  
well i think this is a i think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh  
mm-hmm  
oh you don't want it to be coding th uh based on that though and then that seems a strange way to go about things  
and so that brings us to my personal preferences  
logo  
and then select current colour or line width  
and so if they were black it wouldn't be possible for them to light up  
mm-hmm  
or the the sign  
could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model uh for instance  
yeah we can leave that  
to refill the  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
the functions  
figure out what to do with the furniture either distribute it between various offices or put it into storage somewhere  
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah that's true  
okay  
so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative  
l. c. d. screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons  
yeah  
which is which file to load and and then it's just there  
no  
fall over  
okay go on  
mm-hmm  
or maybe you have to to show some specific <unk> for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically  
yeah  
but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh  
well i <unk> uh you could <unk> you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just  
somebody around must have a uh probably steve  
mm-hmm  
um  
under the cost  
one battery right  
save it  
so you said you want to do separation um but ex exactly yeah  
yeah  
just doodle something on the board on the left  
it's here on the  
this one  
is that a name or a <unk> campaign  
i don't know  
no  
we have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually <unk> willing to spend money to do to get more features and uh among those features l. c. d. screen and voice recognition are very popular  
yeah  
so you don't touch the icons that much  
i have got i think we should also have a back up plan of i 'cause i i i just think that it might be expensive to make something that i mean we don't  
okay right  
mm-hmm  
alright i'm jessy  
finish your meeting now  
things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu because we have no buttons for those  
so basically the idea is that uh in the moment you are in the slide somewhere your language change accordingly to the slide  
your <unk>  
but this is what you would like to ask the user first and i don't think the user would be ready to have a  
special <unk> okay if you lose uh if you lose the  
well we're only four euro over budget  
mm-hmm  
you can print it  
yep fair enough  
you yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
what documentation  
well we discussed it in a previous meeting so i figured i'll just leave it at the l. c. d.  
well i i mean i th i think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those  
i also spoke with fashion experts in milan new york and paris  
okay welcome everyone to our next meeting  
uh well yeah  
yeah that's the point  
you don't have to play with it  
yeah  
oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes between going through your <unk> list and just hitting up one up two  
yeah  
because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip  
so i see ya  
yeah that's yeah that's how we did in in our proposal yeah  
so um  
one  
you go man  
that's the the the mm the new and the funky things that's yeah  
it's really hard to figure out right now  
um the black on the back is the slogan  
and then the so the yeah  
<unk> <unk> better  
yeah mm  
uh but  
difficult  
yeah well don't let it drive you crazy 'cause there is one speaker melissa just played for me today and he stutters horribly  
mm  
and you would otherwise it would be too complicated to cope with the <unk> uh system if you have to re adjust it uh to a different zoom level to get better results  
ca can't we make a docking station of that  
okay  
well i mean i don't think it i just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products  
i mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five so most people  
wait are we are we using this um for the for the for the do for the weighting in the end now this this measure you're calculating  
so  
not freaks the <unk>  
we have to consider it  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah the and this shouldn't be should it  
want it a reasonable size so that if they're looking at it we know they're looking at it though  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
a fashion fashion remote  
hmm  
if pen is selected yes  
yes a one  
the banana  
no you have to put uh switch channels uh at the top because that's the most used function and teletext at the second  
no  
special colour yeah  
okay well i think we're ready to begin  
you can tell it just to again lump them all together that's not a sort of reliable enough fixation  
yeah  
big microphone  
we did mark nebula yes  
maybe one of you can paint it on the board  
will you be presenting that in a bit  
yeah and different televisions  
so that we could reduce cost  
i have i've yeah two or three because it's not just uh the <unk> question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty  
mm  
too expensive yeah  
as you said uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that  
how would you program it though  
um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost either lower or develop an integrated new <unk> technology  
yeah so we would we <unk> wouldn't do it by word we would sorry okay  
i don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that  
yeah i dunno  
so you see that um i it does something  
okay  
so it doesn't actually make a difference for your algorithm 'cause it just means that if you're working on a word level  
yeah it uh and it's too different a genre yeah  
so the these are independent  
and so  
if we if <unk> if we were going to have a product that worked for d. v. d. <unk> v. c. r. <unk> and everything  
um well the buttons etcetera we get from mike  
definitely  
uh it sounds sounds like  
we could use to um to do this kind of segmentation if it's important to the analysis right  
so um but i and nobody has expressed like massive interest in <unk> in <unk>  
on off  
and then you can just resolve those all one by one as as a different set of um changes altogether  
yeah  
smooth keys  
yeah  
but uh it's speech coding at least  
yeah  
okay  
yeah i i think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this  
once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back just so that i don't have to scribble everything down  
um so uh the number in the first brackets is how often it occurred in the um utterances that were annotated as agreements by the uh dialogue act agreement  
okay  
um i guess i should close it here  
i i have one of those <unk> <unk> phones and i mean the back is essentially straight but it's curvy so  
but uh i i think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could  
yeah i have  
the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel  
okay  
yeah yeah you try  
probably so  
yeah it could stand yeah  
so so <unk> yeah we definitely need to operate within our constraints  
okay  
and the area could be smaller  
we well we'd want to use f. zero when it's present  
two  
um where is that  
if the mouse is on the construct then right right  
mm  
oh this you mean  
yeah  
oh okay  
well this is more or less what we just discussed right if i understand  
mm  
well it  
okay well uh it's almost at the end  
because all the t. v. <unk> will have them  
okay um i have to go again  
do you know  
uh so you have a the the side view  
yep  
then we can probably make ways of playing with it in the software and sort of <unk> you know like adapting some sort of control  
so that you can feel them  
we also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control  
so and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh  
okay  
mm mm  
yeah  
right  
yeah  
we put it on a two  
yeah yeah yeah  
so um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep  
okay  
yeah so it should fit right in into your hand  
but if you use uh green on blue those kind of colours will look the same  
if you have black and white or something or grey that's  
with the scroll and the l. c. d.  
but if you just lift it up and say channel one or b. b. c.  
so  
the prices  
uh because we're uh being watched by uh big brother  
mm  
directly  
no no no  
basically this is what we've talked about already um from the marketing point of view  
that happened to me all the time though  
because it'll be more about uh what you guys are bringing to the meeting today  
that means sort of we have multiple levels of of representation which we probably  
i think that's closer to what i said  
yeah it's not that's not streamlined and sexy having a having a wind up  
yeah i think that think that's a good idea  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
exactly  
the channel going up and down  
mm yes but <unk> we're targeting i think on more on the on the twenty to forty group  
you also need how many times things occur within each document  
yeah  
excellent  
um we're down to the prototype presentation  
and i think that's in the shared if i did it right if anyone wants to look at it  
yeah  
ah right  
<unk>  
i uh  
these are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a t. v. remote but the technology  
how how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it  
hmm  
so we should do  
yeah  
and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want  
the little  
hide  
portable seven inch <unk> um lightweight computer screens and uh i'm thinking do you know one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in  
oh yeah yeah  
yeah that's uh their clock component  
one  
we still have problem of two euros  
um the environment will be quite different so a single fixed threshold value might be a problem  
puts fashion into electronics  
oh  
so we've got tool training  
ah  
okay  
and we go to the party  
yeah  
yeah  
i think that's a one  
mm 'kay  
so so we're gonna go through the requirements like that and did did you think that's that was reasonable to after that to try and um actually  
um but i mean like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour l. c. d. screens  
but should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the  
okay mm-hmm  
i don't mind going first  
exactly yeah  
then uh i think it's the same actually i th i think it's data isn't even needed  
right  
yeah  
and uh it's  
mm mm  
and we could have some like you <unk> you could have the fonts you know special  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well uh well i <unk> i know on <unk> if you got a ca if you've got a <unk> project  
<unk> definitely an option technically  
definitely  
and on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone which is somewhere  
i thought we had we'd put in  
so for the financial aspect it's okay we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if  
yeah  
um having the numbers kind of like not a bunch of grapes but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle  
yeah  
yep  
but  
yay  
okay  
seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though  
so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or  
yeah that's quite cool  
yeah  
oh okay  
are they made out of any special material  
but if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything  
um no that's it yeah  
and we've got forty minutes to do that in  
so it's not a place for discussion  
um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah  
um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute it's a  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
what were we doing for things broad absorption line quasar for example  
take notes uh of this meeting and uh i will try to work them out and give them to you  
the one that doesn't have the sound on it it won't  
yeah that's that's the issue  
um  
which puts us just barely under budget  
okay  
yes something like that  
okay  
it's when you have the word set and the word distribution that you <unk> you can tell something  
so that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone  
so no  
functionality  
no  
yeah 'cause i don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment so  
no otherwise we don't have an l. c. d. screen  
uh for the aim of this  
four  
mm-hmm  
that's what it of of course of course of course  
hmm  
yeah  
hmm  
so why don't we just make a swap ins why don't we make a switch instead like  
well i i drew this  
what i was thinking about is just a menu structure when you don't use it is simple  
yeah  
oh  
so um who wants to start off  
mm  
okay  
shared documents  
yeah  
are people maybe not happy with but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case to keep the l. c. d.  
the product um  
which i can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television  
i think he's participant one aren't you  
uh it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world  
so are we basically back to the original one now back to the first version  
if you fill out a four  
oh  
so then it's uh very handy to to scroll down you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or  
yeah  
so just to well to be thorough then width wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something  
yeah  
that's it is possible to get that data out  
yeah  
and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one  
so what is a possibility that you can cut the context instead of having the context from  
oh user friendly  
i know  
right and then it would do just you know uh <unk> kind of cancellation of the noise  
but uh i got uh i got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan  
no i think it's just the casing rubber on the outside  
oh star burst active star burst like activity that's i don't think that's a class  
uh <unk> <unk> well we can still test whether <unk> runs anyway  
yeah uh about  
maybe  
yeah  
okay  
oh yeah that was that was it  
it's under a proper name 'cause it's got a capital t.  
so but he's uh like he's he discuss i mean describing this because even this itself is a problem  
too great for email then  
uh space or ah okay  
small  
uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of <unk> twelve euros  
hmm  
you're going to redesign something  
that you just combine them and then order the time stamps accordingly  
i think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing  
we have plenty of space on m. m. m. so the this is not a problem ah yeah for a new window  
we can transform the double curve into single <unk> yeah  
so it has th the spongy uh feel also  
you all saw the newsflash  
or uh  
just trying to move mine right now  
for all remotes  
right okay  
yeah  
i mean people have argued for ages about exactly what relations were in any of these theories  
oh  
mm-hmm  
so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing  
um  
and yeah the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate <unk> uh more <unk> the answer was already no because of the last minute update  
okay  
and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
so they well they need to be serious about it  
something very cheap  
yeah  
so now we all know what our  
<unk>  
okay  
mm  
leadership sorry  
yeah  
no you don't have to write but you could read no  
yeah  
that's just as <unk> just as easy  
voice recognition of course  
'cause you ten you tend to watch t. v. in the dark but you need to be able to see your l. d. d. l. c. d. display  
sure why not why not  
yes  
then it um then you can then it exports to word automatically  
they're <unk> yeah omni directional yeah  
'cause if we are i reckon we should all read our classes out of the database  
so um i was thinking perhaps at looking um at the um acoustic measures i have  
here he's proposing variable scale because the fixed scale is non optimal for it's non optimum because like for vowels you can have <unk> much longer  
and the fact that <unk> peterson comes between it  
yeah  
there's but it's the board so there you go  
mm-hmm  
okay  
rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure  
yeah  
no no <unk>  
i yeah i don't know if you want to add anything but i would say that for the c. code uh  
and the the casing hard plastic also lasts forever  
no nothing  
yeah  
ah  
yep  
okay  
yeah  
do you think it says r. r.  
yeah  
main controls and a key pad  
okay  
it is going to be kinetic  
still  
yeah  
oh yeah  
no i've i've th i've sort it out  
okay  
<unk> go back  
um so probably  
it's a psychology  
um but that's still sort of that's good  
but but also it seems that  
we do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be  
just maybe talk about um how you would give me your data file  
so um about um foreign words what do we when we're checking um if we come up something so we just leave it as  
hmm  
initials  
um and obviously in p. p. l. s. we've also got english language  
okay  
oh yeah  
<unk>  
twelve euros what's that like eight pounds or something like that nine pounds  
so  
mm-hmm  
so that's not really interesting  
so rubber would be  
well like the integration  
um as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control  
uh should it be equipped with the  
oh right  
but i suppose once it if it gets eaten away a little bit at one some point it becomes <unk> and then yeah  
um  
i would guess so  
yeah  
so like you walk in you're like oh i like that remote control because it's so bright and then  
because i'm eastern european and uh but if we would just play it i think to a <unk>  
but the the text for the actual call is she going to re work something or uh she should  
yep  
ah <unk> hmm  
so  
oh  
should we ask meli should we ask our technical expert melissa  
good  
okay  
oh yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
yep  
yeah  
je croix que c'est <unk> de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype  
yeah  
but that's not in it  
so and we ha we have answer now  
yeah yeah yeah  
but how many remotes do you see like this  
very basic internet yeah  
it's the wind up  
during the session like how many can you have going on at once  
um  
why three  
yeah but it's that's a similar one to what herve has for example some he was showing it uh live on m. l. m. i. <unk> last m. l. m. i. conference  
we'll first look at your uh presentations  
it i can become painful you can have <unk>  
yeah but you you gotta make it clear on the on  
yes the moustache  
yep yep mm-hmm  
uh so drawing it on the board  
um okay then a long battery life like you were talking about earlier and um  
that's the tricky thing  
yeah  
so we <unk> we use uh  
yeah uh uh  
yeah i think today's meeting is really the one where we where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that  
maybe switch t. v. on and off  
well it's one of them out um over here i think actually at the moment  
uh-huh  
so yeah  
yeah  
mm mm mm  
a particular species of cloud not just a general cloud isn't it  
thank you  
um  
yeah  
mm yeah that's true  
there's a option you can choose either t. v. channels or or <unk> or the or the contain or the contents of the programme  
when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went  
which one was the last for you  
well uh uh <unk> what we're i would consider that two parts yep  
um i think there is a way around that  
yeah  
and uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like  
we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black  
um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal  
and the speech uh shall we implement that  
yeah so  
that's right  
yeah because maybe some people prefer a red remote control some people prefer black remote control  
all uh <unk> uh fruit and vegetables are round  
i think it would be better with a personal reference but okay  
mm-hmm  
simple desires into simple actions  
because they only use ten percent of the buttons really  
i think they are counting uh we would prefer yeah  
in the phone that i was thinking of as well when you change the um covers of it the  
so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings which are low relevance and rarely used  
we <unk> we use uh sound cards to to get uh the signals and to detect to uh on to ha and we have a threshold to detect uh when someone is talking  
yeah  
okay so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting  
yeah  
and that's also easy just <unk> when you have a thing like this and you get it here  
yeah  
and the design  
industrial yes  
so titanium coloured plastic for the back  
uh yeah did we achieve that  
six seven eight nine ten  
you know  
but for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition <unk> eventually with use  
you picked a hard one didn't you  
so  
okay th  
and it's just the and that annoys  
part <unk> part from basis it can give  
as in it's not  
uh maybe they will just by seeing an explicit uh feedback of that they will um take profit uh of it and um  
no may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something but it hasn't got  
the <unk> the stu yeah and the remote control might not yeah it might not even function with the old t. v.  
we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh  
so you don't have uh a part for specific uh project  
the conceptual or  
well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable  
a three  
okay one  
it will uh cost a a bit more like i think the advanced chip maybe  
and per perhaps uh  
and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price  
twenty three yeah  
so uh oval <unk> those are here  
but thing is it's not you don't need the solar all the time  
yeah but what do we ha we have l. c. display but but the <unk> but the <unk> spinning wheel  
right so i think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you <unk> presentations um we've got uh <unk> the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
as we we we we agreed we do have a l. c. d.  
yeah  
yeah  
well you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements  
i really see but the cost i  
yeah  
oh  
but i don't know any decisions on  
no it can be disturbed by by noise and  
well  
no it's not sound proof  
those are probably the <unk> four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control  
yeah  
so you you you you select d. one so in this set which is the most similar to d. two according to the distribution from one or the other model  
it appears in correspondence of one slide then of course it seems to be very related  
yeah  
okay  
see as soon as as soon as i'm halfway through my l. s. a. like basically as soon as i have the the matrix built  
those things just refer to each of each of us i think  
no  
i understand  
yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to <unk> yeah contrast and brightness  
yeah but i can't can <unk>  
um  
from the  
and it's just you won't have to think about it  
um kate steph sarah and myself in our four capacities were present  
yeah  
caramel  
what what would be on that touch screen  
without <unk> taking your hand off the remote  
so i just got an email saying that  
so isn't that different  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base  
as you write your personal coach  
okay  
yeah i i agree  
and it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep  
or the interaction designer  
but have you ever used like dictation system for windows  
mm i haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet  
i don't even know what time scale they had in mind  
at least  
mm  
right  
yeah  
yeah <unk> lights on and or flash as well  
uh alright  
it's basically it has some futuristic  
ye uh  
mm  
what are <unk>  
yeah  
no it's not right  
i think it would be annoying though if i don't use teletext that much  
yep  
alright  
so  
so  
they could buy cases maybe  
yeah  
that suggests he's done done done  
so could you say uh video name <unk> slash something  
mm  
that's a good point  
did they jointly look at square one  
yeah that's just  
uh and also think maybe a little bit about <unk> <unk> <unk> what would just wanna be <unk> easily accessible  
so trends  
yeah  
okay  
for normal sketches  
uh a <unk> a few things i uh i noticed uh were um  
it's slow  
okay  
five years just because of the floods bringing the ceilings down  
oh yeah  
okay  
i think that perhaps the project <unk> just supposed to be completed by me  
my project documents  
um where did i put it  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh  
'cause it's not well i don't know  
okay um uh i just want to hear uh <unk> um input for this meeting  
yeah  
can be moved around all nice  
because if you're watching uh i don't know you're in the at day uh cartoons will come up <unk> on maybe friday night  
uh  
it's just  
and different different people sort of prefer different things  
like what it's like if you just take single words out of utterances  
for um you can have a switch menu so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions  
so that  
now i'd like to give the word to you two  
but it's good to keep in mind  
yeah  
but  
but we lose the locator  
right it's like those watches that you <unk> so  
so you can adjust which buttons you want on that <unk> screen  
i think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then  
i mean the it's probably very dependent on the speaker as well  
'cause the model builder um assumes that there's an existing set of of original parts  
well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that  
yes  
but not with rabbits  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
and for you that would be quite easy to translate into those segments  
if you have a <unk> box you've got like you don't have to buy all the channels you've about fifty channels can you imagine trying to  
mm  
mm yep  
but even this maybe really huge data also  
so it has voice control  
how can i say this  
so um the approach we're taking here is to answer both questions the same time  
'cause it's very big and chunky and child friendly and  
is there such a thing um as um you know dual track video  
it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway so i don't know if a lid is a good idea  
interface button push button interface  
sorry too uh  
so i will start with the presentation of my work  
right  
okay so these were the basic findings from today  
um i don't know how it is exactly but they got very very famous for this for that <unk>  
titanium the really strong metal titanium  
mm-hmm  
it just occurred to me that they all  
scratchy  
we <unk> we couldn't grab information information which is not there  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so so is the <unk> evaluation depending on us or other users  
well well <unk> <unk> maybe <unk> maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a <unk> very normal case but  
yeah  
so but that means in the general structure we're actually quite lucky  
now don't get excited yet i've got more to say on that  
uh-huh  
oh  
yeah okay  
so you'll get it on your em on your laptop  
uh fruity like  
hmm  
yeah actually i have <unk>  
we have lunch break and then we have thirty minutes of individual work  
what did  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
receiving  
as a manufacturer and as a as a um distributor <unk> to other wholesalers  
mechanisms  
mm  
but good to look into renewable energy always the way  
well another thought i oh sorry go ahead  
yes  
and channel  
ah such yeah  
mm  
that's all  
oh yeah um yeah  
and also the bleep when what i told you about uh when you lost it  
oh yeah yeah  
the real reactor i don't find that uh that bad at all  
uh may i say something about  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
ye yeah  
so i don't know what why it doesn't appear but it just uh a simple problem in the get frame  
mind if we move on  
so the method is <unk> there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like  
yeah yeah au <unk> <unk> that it yeah  
yeah  
yeah and fiddle around with it and press it  
yeah that's okay  
and we also had a remote control for our radio set  
yeah  
uh i think we use di distinct train and test set even se the different sets of phonemes  
and we we did right  
never mind  
so what do you mean by just not print out that  
and then there is a. <unk> mouse not their eyes is on an object right  
the banana is also ergonomic  
are they expensive  
oh okay mm-hmm  
um  
yeah we want something easy to use and so i think maybe something very low level <unk> would be enough  
yeah  
um  
mm-hmm  
right  
what have we got  
or to detect that someone is more that was not talking before is talking now  
yeah  
hmm  
okay  
so my name is mark dwight and um i am responsible for user interface design  
we should see if what it costs if it's possible  
yeah  
well i dunno  
i ha i ha i have the i have  
okay yeah  
no just the remote  
yeah i had what i just uh i should again  
um well i don't remember that about the <unk> i mean the  
yes  
well i think we can i i think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the real reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools  
mm yeah indeed  
uh it's uh  
that's because the way how we handle it at the moment is that dave prepares an audio file  
mm-hmm  
yeah but  
um i thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the t. v. set  
right  
but there's a different set of tags in there from the kinds of relations you see within r. s. t. for example  
after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be <unk> a cool remote you know  
i think the the the real point is when  
yeah uh five  
yeah  
change the channel you know channel up channel down  
the the there is not uh <unk> uh perfect uh clustering <unk> <unk> what is the how do you judge uh what is a good clustering  
oh uh i'm not sure  
ours too  
i dunno i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later  
if  
with the remote  
um um we yeah  
so some findings um um  
so i tried to sketch it out  
i did have one other um one other frame i thought i mean i i <unk> not knowing how we would deal with this information  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
they just need a a desk and probably just one drawer under underneath  
it's just a wish list  
one with and one without l. c. d. <unk>  
we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber  
the electrical cable uh does  
yeah  
i like the idea but we have <unk> we have to find out  
yes  
mm-hmm  
um power buttons are mostly at the top  
i think it is good also <unk> to have a spongy material yeah  
yeah  
this is nice tea  
okay so  
a as a and then you just measure it against you know the <unk> the <unk> yeah the cumulative total time record or something  
<unk> and just use basic l. p. c. ten style  
and you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information  
those are the the <unk> the channel buttons of course  
okay so we want the remote to be the <unk> the side view actually what i'm gonna draw  
'cause she's the one that has thoughts about the language and stuff  
oh yeah that'd be fine that'd be great  
uh the buttons are lit  
oh <unk>  
i think they're talking about l. c. d. type things  
like  
i hope uh you both did some uh some work uh  
um maybe for the younger market  
yeah  
yeah  
well i i haven't replied to him about yeah i really don't have anything more more recent from him  
pretty confident  
yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into  
yeah that's fine  
yeah  
um  
i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the <unk> on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay  
but that's easy 'cause mine can take uh any number of parameters  
so we're quite fixed  
so nothing  
yeah  
you uh got uh  
hmm  
no no uh  
uh said about uh the components uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those <unk> remote controls  
yep  
it's uh you can say that's very yeah  
mm-hmm  
but i wanna start with uh stuff you did first so we can see what everybody came up with  
yeah it's size al almost  
generating shapes no problem  
uh  
something like that  
mm  
oh it's not working anymore  
okay  
uh but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
whatever  
yes no but but in fact we have uh yes we are designing uh a noise sensitive table just <unk> from your ring  
<unk> resistors and a <unk> all those basic things that make a circuit function  
that's why  
like uh  
yeah  
yeah  
if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the <unk> with uh with uh the button  
uh well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant i think  
<unk> <unk>  
yeah sorry introduction and get acquainted and  
yeah  
yeah yeah i understand but no no i don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course  
okay  
okay  
mm  
but we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme aren't we  
so you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all  
no  
yes  
into your screen  
are you finding it okay or  
so yeah  
a <unk>  
that's okay  
yeah  
uh there's been bit of uh are they just for distribution at conferences and things  
so the only thing it would be that the display gets information about where they are and displays them as hard boundaries  
but it might make much more you know i mean  
ah  
well if it was if it was absorption and damped lyman alpha clouds you'd not mark absorption  
personally  
mm  
well it's not okay i mean this is kinda what we were talking about before this confusion about what's in the g. d. f.  
yeah  
i don't know what else but  
it just you press the buttons on top because your finger is on top  
different functions of of uh  
it's just too many things at once and it wasn't important that it be then  
okay yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one  
it's still an option if we need it  
so you're like oh did i just do that  
that's  
or it can be like a a shape quite uh with curves  
so  
yeah it is  
it's all about the buttons  
um  
ooh i'm designing a remote control i dunno if that's just me but  
so that's why we might have to extend nite clock and like override the function that react to that  
i'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have <unk> want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones  
it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to  
hmm  
yeah but actual environment  
yeah but the wave file is th that's in the temp only right  
yeah  
i'll be your project manager for today for this project  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm and <unk> basically they are programmable specially for children  
for the higher bands you if you put in just <unk> some garbage some noise it doesn't really <unk> <unk> matter all that much  
sorry  
so that would give us a chance of meeting in for an hour before that to discuss the questions that we had  
and so you know which shape they match  
well  
if somebody says where is the remote then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something i dunno  
then i think also two yeah  
are we all gonna draw a cat  
but may what i've already started doing is <unk> i created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine  
mm-hmm  
so you are user interface guy  
in the word files  
mm-hmm  
we might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there yeah yeah yeah like that like that  
oh okay oh like a wave okay  
yeah  
alright yeah  
um and and i presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or d. v. d. remote control  
is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi device remote control  
can we uh power a light in this  
so teletext can be skipped  
right  
yes  
okay  
yeah  
yes i think it was ma maybe if it was star forming like activity that would be different  
increase the price  
'cause i'll just tell 'em a modified version of that  
mm-hmm  
think so  
so what kind of <unk> can we put on  
it's a scary cartoon dog  
so uh um we've got thirty minutes to  
not too many  
yeah  
common the students yeah yeah  
tuner would that have up and down  
if  
mm-hmm  
so um if you can look up at the screen  
yeah yeah what's yeah yeah  
so any income is welcome  
we don't have to design a protocol so  
okay and i also uh yeah  
right  
the logo and the and the  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
well i already uh <unk> uh explained some properties of that material and i think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component  
yes as well  
maybe we will  
count it  
you may think that they're missing something then we we could certainly augment them  
i think that that's fine just for the t. v.  
i think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double r.  
um so i guess the rest of it i think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are  
yeah i i will continue  
there's examples of those but they don't look as sleek as other models  
but we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control  
really  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
'cause it's i thought they were thirty percent each  
well yeah  
um but um yeah  
yeah i think infra red  
okay  
mm-hmm  
with a fruit uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
one second  
mm  
not just yet  
it's uh your it's your job  
um  
so we're <unk> <unk> quite far over  
we have to market it  
well if i give it a one  
thing uh yeah it speaks for itself  
uh it is <unk> uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as <unk> it is as easy as uh printing a page  
evaluation  
and then we are just going to have an average which will give us the value of our uh remote control  
in memory yeah  
<unk> let's say that th <unk> it has to be basically you can only take two sides  
yeah  
so these are two example  
that's okay  
then you lose it yeah  
um i i think for the moment  
optional  
mm  
okay  
you have to  
okay  
yeah and that's also fairly easy to store along with our segments isn't it  
um but this is how the basic system works  
so these are people who are <unk> right  
that will only save you one  
uh  
yeah each television  
yeah  
mm  
oh okay  
they've identified this product <unk> that's why i say i don't i don't see the market niche for this  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah yeah  
thing we need to address is our financial department to meet our our budget  
nasty  
so we have to <unk> we have to do something about that  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
how do we <unk> wa how do we start  
you know something where it's uh a a more advanced <unk> form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it  
and that's what you they use more or less in t. n. o. also  
i like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable something that you can drop and it doesn't matter  
okay  
process any arbitrary x. m. l.  
um  
awesome  
no i <unk> i think that's more in  
what are those <unk> tooth uh brushes or so  
people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition  
but it won't get that small because you have how much  
yeah  
but that's not for our that's not our decision to take  
yeah is that so this whole thing is an instrument you say  
okay  
is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it  
that sounds good  
yeah  
but th but <unk> but thing is if if we if we got if we got tracks for each for each part we can we can easily <unk> it down later on  
yeah so i'll i'll go with that actually so um  
because that's with l. c. d. just will increase the price and i <unk> i they have the same rate so without l. c. d. it will be  
get that one  
so we can call our remote control the mushroom  
i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really  
uh first a little opening  
yeah  
i think it's uh as easy as uh can be made  
well that might be com problematic with um copyright issues  
you see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh  
two three  
um if you do then the people formulating research questions will ask about them  
so sounds crazy  
besides look at what the l. c. d. does to our lovely remote  
mm-hmm  
and then uh tying in a trendy look with user friendliness  
yeah  
doesn't mean that we <unk> we have to to stop talking yet  
yeah 'cause you said about disposable didn't you  
and do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark  
okay yeah  
so not yet i'm afraid  
and uh kinetic and and and <unk> are are not very practical i think  
it automatically goes yeah  
there you go  
oh  
that doesn't look like a cow does it  
no  
<unk> uh  
no you wouldn't do  
cool  
the more we can make uh at once uh in one piece uh that is cheaper  
oh is that what that means  
it's true that these one or two last one or two years we didn't have uh a visiting professor  
do you have the cost or uh  
yep  
and yeah  
six  
um the way it works is that you have the keys here  
then whatever the data is like it would always <unk>  
and <unk> the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh <unk> uh perform a a some kind of uh  
yeah you have the re remote in your hand like this  
well yeah  
yeah  
we probably have to make the segment lines a lot bigger  
sure sure  
oh working design i got it  
um yeah  
i don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand  
like like a book  
thank you  
okay  
yeah  
but we don't know  
um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition  
and then i was throwing away some some of them you know  
you know how to submit costs and stuff like that  
we we <unk> we'll just give them an uh we'll design it and then they can give comments on it  
but suddenly we <unk> <unk> he said well so so where are you  
and then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype  
so i don't think many <unk>  
oh  
and uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths  
but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something there wouldn't be any point  
yeah  
well if if it's fruit and vegetables it have to be <unk>  
so uh it's a point to discuss  
i dunno  
but uh  
yeah yeah  
right okay  
in fact this is a video card with four um inputs  
note that the push button requires a simple chip chip  
i think the official le sort of the official description of what it tells you is um how much that like the fact that a given word occurs tells you about what's the next word's gonna be  
exactly  
somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement  
but this this but this would never happen anyway  
you know <unk> we can find the time whether it is your time whether it is the time of someone else  
if we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick  
very easy to use  
we didn't <unk>  
it is home or home speech or something  
i so i don't <unk> i think there was a lot of room for creativity  
um so what i'm trying to run through in my head is that we can always tell the difference between um something going out of existence 'cause it's joined to construct something going out of existence 'cause we threw it away  
yep  
yeah  
i don't know  
so i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to say about it  
when you got children their their stuff gets inside the circuitry they get dirty they get messy with drinks and stuff  
that's quite what <unk> does  
i don't know if it works but it should be saved  
this is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control  
mm-hmm  
maybe maybe we can make a t. v. guide on it for the channel you're on  
yeah that's very good 'cause the highest we <unk> got is one  
but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons so those always fade first  
that'd be good in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually  
until here or something  
otherwise you will never find it  
oh <unk> yeah we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed  
components and user interface concept  
or  
twelve euro fifty  
it's got to change  
um that you you sort of hold in your hand um well i'm trying to think  
i think we <unk> i think we did very well uh <unk> even if you look at this score we did quite well  
give a lot of information how it is audio programming and so on works cetera  
and um you know ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control  
well project evaluation  
uh the findings i've got some pictures to show you as well  
if you have uh it have it in your hand  
uh it fell off  
do you think it matters whether something is knowledge or opinion in the way it contributes to the group process  
three  
so you have some special tools from uh from real media  
so i think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use  
and if they do not very often  
yeah just another five euro to get  
yeah  
so um presentations were you anybody got <unk> to go  
no it's not  
yeah it's in the should be in the <unk> project  
it's a really good style it going to be look like like this  
yes  
hey mouse  
so so we need to still preserve some uh sense of the activity  
you'd you'd have to the the ami recognition system that we have now is either for these microphones or for the microphone array  
alright yeah  
marketing expert  
and um yeah  
well yeah  
ah <unk> we went to like far south to lagos and yeah that wa uh ha yeah  
okay time for another animal  
so if you've um if you're back to a page then you tick it again to leave it for the second time  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk>  
maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote  
let's go ahead and start off with your presentations  
yes  
i think it uh has to be a <unk> it has to have round forms or something  
mm  
yeah  
or is it just gonna be displaying single meetings and you'll hold up different ones  
so have a wheel for incremental have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected  
all the other things can be controlled through the screen  
so  
and <unk> i don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff  
and uh well round shapes primary colours  
that's i think it's a good idea  
young people probably because it's a buzz word find it very relevant  
and then  
then this is an option  
um uh to go back and forward between pages and of course uh to save it every now and then  
basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market right  
yeah  
and then you have the the current colour you can change  
okay  
i'll give it a one  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
mm  
um  
um is there any room for a little presentation  
a fairly simple uh not fancy but not totally minimalist i mean just pretty simple plastic  
but well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set up  
<unk>  
all over the place  
yes  
so we're moving in the right direction like  
yeah  
but if you don't they'll probably ask about them anyway and then you'll have to add 'em after the fact  
<unk>  
industrial designer  
so i here it's fine to do motion compensation but <unk> rather than yeah  
is that some long division  
line feature need that  
and volume is <unk> yeah  
yep  
so it doesn't matter  
so hope you have good ideas  
but would that not require three clocks and i but that but but that also means  
nice  
um  
little smiley cat there  
uh i don't know what product evaluation exactly means but uh you'll get uh the specifications  
yeah it is it is harder to  
but we have to use the solar cell  
mm  
yeah  
yeah i suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit  
just every once in a while or constantly  
you know like go to the base  
it it does  
was there a questionnaire already sent  
no  
'kay down here case material  
um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh <unk> functions  
i <unk> i think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here i mean  
<unk> you could include a pen  
what do <unk> what do you what how do you plug that into the rest the stuff right  
yeah yeah  
okay  
yeah yeah so this yeah  
it's one special colour  
m. m. r. mister  
yeah  
grapefruit is what we'd go for when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps  
mm-hmm  
so if we have a l. c. d. on the remote rather than looking onto the t. v. you just look into a remote and navigate it  
yeah  
they they've recently brought out this new remote control for people to set their favourite channels or um to record things  
<unk> you know you lose the monkey the banana  
<unk>  
yeah  
huh  
so there is  
yep  
one on this side one on that side but they're opposite sides  
if it comes to it i'll just um install <unk> and stuff on my linux machine and work on that  
uh twelve point fifty euro  
yeah uh the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it  
yes that's a rabbit  
yeah we could come to blows over soft excess  
well i'm not sure because um for that to happen you <unk> you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control  
if um  
mm  
use the pen  
i think it would be simpler  
oh  
um do you have a <unk> or no  
and so i there's no are you planning some kind of partition between the lounge and the offices or <unk> how are you gonna keep those things i think should ask the question to you  
so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget  
okay  
um for one thing  
and then <unk> just sort of that initial shape we had just which is uh sort of banana <unk>  
i don't suppose we have to stick to co  
<unk> they probably clip to you  
we need time <unk>  
uh <unk> what did you think of our project process  
we can't use that to  
no that's true  
one point five of a euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right  
two or three  
in in fact i'd  
yeah  
hmm  
thanks  
and i think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user  
i wanna know how our product would fare  
is that okay with you  
how we can make it work  
uh <unk>  
uh  
oh yeah sure  
yeah but uh when you use more than one colour it's a special colour  
terrible  
yeah  
just in time  
mm  
okay  
so my personal preferences here  
it says menu  
we could just make that uh like a run time flag and then make a few ifs and say if  
i mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote  
better make it  
mm yep  
okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve  
huh  
yeah okay  
it doesn't matter  
yeah  
an infra red signal  
mm-hmm  
so we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost  
i hope our industrial designer does this better because uh this is uh  
uh i mean uh i mean the <unk> main actions might be some it might be yeah built built  
okay  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
so we could do like a <unk> a hard base plastic and then we could give two latex covers to start  
uh  
okay let's move on  
yeah  
i usually hold it in one hand  
turn uh turn up the volume  
uh chi fong went to t. i. and uh and uh uh uh <unk> barry is at lawrence livermore lab  
just  
uh  
right right right  
um  
don't make it wood  
yeah  
but we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved  
yeah that's true  
production costs  
yeah  
the circuit board  
the but this being a head set mic channel <unk> may make it easier to hear  
but it was blue on the board  
does anyone have a general overview over the whole time issue like as in what date is it today  
<unk> maybe  
that seems unlikely  
it's uh you can listen to it yeah  
but then the buttons would have to be very small  
um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects  
um so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think  
i hope i didn't go through that too quickly  
yeah right  
something i was wondering about was the power  
bob  
mm  
the elevation no  
okay  
once somebody will come with something new okay he he's showing it works for some <unk> but still yeah yeah  
um well i mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control  
either at the library or uh or or come back or go and see joe <unk> or whatever  
you mean of  
not really  
i don't know  
why not  
and him  
it's just a location  
yeah yeah  
i think i think we have spent  
okay  
the only problem it's done if we've both been not marking it there might be other instances in the text where it's not marked  
so second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
it'd be nice to have some sort of <unk> coding scheme for the for the voice signal as well right  
yeah  
so that indicates our technological advancement  
maybe it will be in <unk> the summary constructor then  
oh sorry  
okay  
this something what's projection from behind i guess  
i mean what other what other fruit and vegetables do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow  
and single curved  
uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it  
okay  
i doubt they are trying right now  
mm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
no no no  
that's not our that's not our <unk> design  
but young people want something different and it is  
mm-hmm  
uh yeah this is getting all  
yeah  
so so a small speaker you mean  
it's a very complex animal and um yeah  
oh yeah  
yes  
th so there's this part um which is made of hard plastic the front  
hmm  
i was  
here think about removable covers as seen in mobile <unk> telephone market  
mm-hmm  
i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one <unk> and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan  
mm-hmm  
op mm 'kay  
uh are there other things about the market we should know  
you can  
um  
i think that's what they probably mean  
yeah this is a bar scale we are using  
so there is no major problem except time  
um  
mm yeah  
right  
um it'd be a lot of word for really no extra <unk> feature gain at all  
but i think i <unk>  
okay well i can do mine  
<unk> do you mean something like that  
yeah  
but don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther  
yeah yeah yeah  
that might be a next step  
yeah  
we could  
so it sounds like well <unk>  
like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby  
so  
that's our what makes it special  
ooh that's a bit difficult to see  
oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros  
mm mm mm  
definitely  
mm  
<unk> doesn't it work  
no no  
so you can't collect them  
there was no decision made on the <unk> or double curvature or straight  
i would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work  
four  
yeah  
maybe or an update software update  
hmm  
um  
okay  
and um there's one other feature that we were debating but we decided to go against it  
uh that must be made but i don't know here is uh standing uh whoa we can celebrate now but the end report is  
if you have anything to add please interrupt me  
i think everybody should do it so  
so we just we're sort of running different types of queries on it  
yeah so you can do you have something  
yeah  
yeah  
i've always loved tigers  
it's a very basic one  
uh  
it's quite complicated  
no that's good  
yeah that's gonna be what's communicating with the t. v. but the other bulb i think  
yeah  
yes more robust  
it's not very flashy and new  
is there any dice machines in this building  
components  
which will be used for for the television for the recorder for the camcorder and all the others  
document and settings  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
at the end then they will ask you to <unk> some sentence and you have to <unk> them and then you have to send them  
so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case  
and uh make it <unk> or uh like cell phones <unk> exchangeable covers  
yeah  
yeah  
so it detects  
so  
ah yeah sure  
um  
yeah probably yeah yeah  
what if i really needed something  
your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies  
yeah i'm  
say no  
i kind of like that look  
suggest ways about doing it and um be able to play them back and see um when we think we've got these things right  
some function or like a  
um but we still need to <unk> think about the colour of our remote as such you know just keep it black or  
um i am here  
uh  
oh sorry  
yeah it's normal colour  
okay  
how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device  
we don't  
so you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and  
but uh if it is uh if it is related to the <unk> what he is giving a presentation on the slide then you show the your a. s. r. if you detect this even then you can show that how where you can really help or not help  
okay  
mm  
okay  
um second i received um some new project requirements  
all right  
yeah  
but then probably it's the only time that mm was spelled with a dot at the end and stuff  
ah it could be it could be um  
you could have an option to turn it off  
and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing  
'cause that would be more specifically a digital box mm-hmm  
the most boring fronts possible  
no  
width  
so if you get if you drag a new part out of the parts bin  
well uh a f. p. g. a. is just a chip you can uh you can <unk> programme it uh <unk> with <unk> whatever you want  
between one and two  
and so on that you can just much in the same way as an existing sky remote scroll along scroll up and down  
that's great and it's very bright as well  
okay  
i wanna find our if our remote works  
yeah don't worry about it  
that's just the wrong colour as is that  
how minutes  
yeah  
th that's the most that that's very easy  
so we've listed a couple of uh  
no no no not very far  
um mark the user interface design and uh sammy uh the product evaluation  
yeah  
yeah so it's a  
um yeah i mean i <unk> i th i <unk> envisaged that if if this was the the thing  
<unk> however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert  
and after that uh we <unk> 'cause this mm is not in the hub corpus  
no  
really  
yes  
up and down is  
marketing person  
the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at  
okay  
yeah so i mean either a channel up and down volume up and down  
aren't you  
okay  
then you also have to have different languages if we go international  
do people uh when they pick up a remote know that they have to do that  
and yeah i didn't see anything else i could take out  
you can point to <unk> emission rather than  
um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria and that's with courtney  
we couldn't dump them from their start points  
right and  
yeah  
with get frame  
so we can go to through to project evaluation  
once once we've done that it's whatever whatever you <unk> whatever you whatever you want me do once i done the once i've done the g. d. f. i guess  
yeah  
yep  
you push the one  
so  
so it's just the complex operation  
so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be  
right  
okay  
where  
at all yep  
'kay next  
yeah turning yeah yeah  
okay so here are a a plastic  
cool so these are what they are  
'cause we've lost the overall spongy feel  
yeah  
ah yeah  
yeah a audio settings mono stereo pitch bass treble  
alright  
can try to plug that in there but  
we we have to use yellow  
yeah  
oh yep sorry  
so maybe i can  
um here are two example remotes  
okay  
yeah  
because they don't really need to put lot of uh memory and these things otherwise if they want to build a real  
maybe um the  
but is it really costly the system is  
et et al et <unk> is the full word and et cetera means and following  
yeah a three  
yeah  
so i was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies one is the usual batteries which are there  
so basically we  
we might possibly have done  
yeah  
but why are they buying one in the first place  
could granny do this or are we just not aiming at granny  
uh  
does kinda make you wonder i mean how much can you do with a remote control  
mm-hmm  
mind you the the figure last was was different but it should be <unk>  
okay what do it's eyes like  
'cause i was like <unk> and then i'm like wait it won't let me google  
if it was  
it's um  
any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference  
i mean is it fancy everything i believe uh  
mm  
so does this i think <unk> oh and information was a bit low i think  
and um they are the biggest terrestrial animal  
hmm  
different colours maybe yeah  
it's based on the <unk> <unk> right  
and another nice feature that i would like to implement is uh volume control  
and eight is uh is good  
yeah  
yeah i'm i'm  
i don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about  
try uh try yeah  
yeah  
and you can adjust the resolution so that oh  
are you dissing my drawing  
or absorption at five thousand <unk> would all be one anyway  
we figured it could stand up like this on your table if you wanted it to if i made the <unk> the bottom flat  
the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls  
and then there is translation on the right yeah  
i think you'll all be paid uh well have you not  
but we can some way find a guy  
for instance here it's it's it's it's  
well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the t. v. for example  
some some  
mm  
an orange banana whatever  
<unk> why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white board  
okay  
uh i just had a thought actually sorry to interrupt  
so uh i i think we've done an amazing job in uh  
and <unk> <unk> but it's tragedy  
um are they uh if you say so  
they feel kind of like um you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not  
yeah sure  
right  
this not on the card  
yeah  
yeah alright  
just think that fifty percent of the words on average whatever corpus you take are stop words articles et cetera  
you know you see the modern d. v. d. <unk> just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of <unk> through the menu like that  
okay so  
mm-hmm  
where are you from in california by the way  
then you shift to twenty five and so forth until you  
yellow a real reaction  
cool  
so um you can save on that  
you mean this one  
not too many uh gadgets and functions  
uh  
and then one way of compressing the harmonic <unk> is just storing the smooth spectrum  
so we are asked to  
yes but what are the other things that's uh some kind of number  
okay  
yep  
no  
yeah  
no uh  
well it it it's if you uh  
so now we have to ask whether um  
interactive display  
i don't really feel it  
like that's kind of fruity or something  
yeah i see  
copy paste uh this story into a into a word document and then uh put the answers after the subjects  
it appears in almost uh uh it is if it appears in all the slides it says a hundred percent correlation for me  
yeah  
oh actually it's not a problem of doing it  
so that if you yeah like profile so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of t. v. uh  
yeah so so they they we're allowed to do whatever without without source code  
or uh we should have some agreement on that before we  
this is the first meeting  
we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l. c. d. and scroll  
no more expensive maybe  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
so you <unk> so uh you mean to say that um like when one case you were saying that if you include the context and all those thing it helps in your a. s. r. improvement  
uh  
if i <unk> if i'm thinking of the right one i've got the same thing in front of my monitor  
uh when i saw your <unk> oh  
okay  
this is a model yeah  
not user friendly  
you know so if you have like  
so this is our product or prototype  
yeah  
that's still a lot  
well you <unk> well uh yes  
so  
yeah because the <unk> was provided to us while we had time to prepare whereas i can imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush  
yeah where they do all the <unk> with with them actually  
it's a favourite channel  
'cause in san diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern california they steam them  
so  
yes it is  
yeah they cannot speak at the same time  
just give some questions uh  
uh i only know that if we are using that we need <unk> uh an advanced chip in it  
ah it's not an <unk> but it's for all kind of t. v. <unk>  
um do we have  
exactly  
but the l. c. d. is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons  
<unk> function  
and maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself  
yeah  
uh i'll be in um the appleton tower anyway  
yeah yeah  
oh we skipped introductions  
so which might uh speak change <unk> uh uh would be a very good indicator yeah  
yeah  
yeah and it mm  
at the the percentage score  
so that'd be six hours  
um user really really want a fancy look and feel  
uh quite big also and they were selling something like a hundred euros two hundred euros  
uh-huh  
expert  
yeah gives you the options  
so so that would be a boring that would be definitely boring meeting  
yeah but i also meant the the blinking li <unk> you know the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote  
six  
yeah  
mm  
if we decide to use the speech recognition then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards  
i don't know anything about user interface or design  
yeah but  
quite <unk>  
two  
alright  
yeah  
i that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters  
mm-hmm  
it  
well it's a statement which uh i disagree with  
pitch um the uh uh timbre en francais  
i'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print  
i i think i can remember almost all of them but <unk> it's it's a bit uh uh stressful  
i'm not sure i what you mean  
um ryan is our user interface designer  
zapping your favourite channels eh  
can make several uh concepts  
so um the developments i will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours  
huh  
um  
so let's <unk> say three  
yeah  
well you can <unk> them because they are th it's there's a structure on the on the web page  
um so <unk> but other i i'd <unk> i'd be very surprised if there wasn't a free package for doing it  
design  
yeah  
no i'm going to listen  
a little chat  
that's just that's somewhere to start from  
could it it it would be good if it had the actual programme that was on and what was next  
uh but i'm trying to uh to to to see what is very important and uh what is not uh for  
but in terms of the actual technology none of it is actually new  
two or three  
it's really ugly  
i figure if she is a person that calls circuit circuit  
but we don't have any scrolls  
so the titanium case is the normal case that i'll show you some pictures that i have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not  
so i've got a new um trainee who might need amusement at some point  
so i was <unk> i was hoping you could use that to  
yeah  
if  
wrote nearly a page but not  
uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can <unk> you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way  
uh the push buttons  
um yeah i think uh sort of triangle shaped bottom or something  
and then you could say well i also tried on this and this  
um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points  
yeah  
yeah  
uh it's a one or a two  
alright  
let's see where my  
is there the scroll wheel okay  
'kay i've speed up  
so basically there are five systems  
mm  
yeah or just different colours would be uh i don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control  
okay  
yeah something that doesn't  
uh oh now i've gone too far  
if you hold it like that the one on your thumb yeah the thumb button is the power button  
yeah but then the the the <unk> the <unk> script will tell you how <unk> it will tell you how far apart they are  
within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control  
i have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented  
durable  
we can discuss that off line  
something like <unk>  
and the data we have then uh enough for the for a thesis of course it must be much better  
so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very <unk> looking graphics on it  
sure  
yeah  
yeah  
um okay then i think we are uh quite finished  
yeah just figure out how we're gonna help him to to try to make this more efficient  
yeah  
i've already got more than i can keep track of  
so  
mm-hmm  
just type in the digits  
well i don't think uh  
excellent  
it's my turn  
well for example this phase information right  
same  
yeah okay  
yeah  
huh  
yeah yeah i mean it that's what it makes me think of mobile phones  
okay  
okay  
none of us will buy it  
yeah i was gonna say thirty five to fifty  
but yeah all the you can get all the utterances  
yeah  
'kay  
and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative  
okay  
uh i think the idea uh about uh touch screen  
talk conference  
it's only that the event gets triggered by the search routine which sort of push that into nite x. m. l. and says please go there now  
and i was sent a report that was i think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed  
um well um i thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up  
mm-hmm  
it's  
my computer crashed so uh  
mm  
yeah  
although of course i mean at twenty five euros i don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device  
an elk  
is  
yeah  
that's that's why  
um one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as  
yes  
yeah you <unk> you would  
even <unk> petr <unk> is not here you probably know a lot about it by now  
so  
andrew  
yeah it's stolen technology  
what is the folder that you put yours in  
oh there is no ha ha  
twenty five to thirty five there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group  
yeah and it's <unk> more like presentation and some points were discussed  
so it'd be like  
mm-hmm  
right  
otherwise i don't care what i put there because it's the chip which i buy or which we buy  
anyway the recording is finished i think  
okay  
yeah  
sorry  
no  
so does anyone have any uh thoughts  
um  
sorry  
oh  
yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box yeah  
this is just like a rough schematic  
at least when there is t. v. you can get light from the t. v.  
mm  
yes  
so counting then is two and a half  
mm-hmm  
i think so too  
oh  
yeah  
but i think wood is not an option either  
okay the other one is just a static dialogue acts box  
so yeah i don't know if we're <unk>  
yeah  
it's it's more like if you were giving the people you you said to them okay  
yep  
bra  
yeah  
for the menus  
oh it's a shark now  
mm-hmm  
um to research it i've um had a look on the the <unk> again  
so maybe we i've seen a lot of purses with olives on them you know  
yes  
yeah  
what technique <unk> use is it's your choice like but that database and then the results analysis is they decide so  
no i didn't  
but but  
no  
maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside  
uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million euros  
well another thing you have to remember is these models have been tuned to include ami data  
i um i think the <unk> the only thing i've got left to do before the experiments can be run is get <unk> is get the check <unk> works  
that's true  
it's like those fancy <unk>  
oh your remote control  
like when it's being accessed  
no knew that  
and i have to go up onto the <unk> and do this apparently so i'll go over here  
um some of the uh remotes that i looked at one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um  
<unk> broad <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah but when you use covers it basically easier to have a <unk> have a neutral colour on the base  
you so we open up that blank here  
well the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side  
very well  
so we're now on to project process  
this one is  
probably all these <unk> and uh <unk> are spelled differently in the thing or what's the problem  
mm  
yeah i think so without it being too in fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here  
yeah  
it does  
you can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself you don't need basic station  
yeah sort of like that  
mm  
sorry about this guys  
okay some other time  
yeah  
our own people can make that i think  
so there's two issues here  
okay  
yeah  
is the department growing  
<unk> not  
for you too yeah  
i'm uh slightly unsure  
then you have the seventy five percent of users find it <unk> ugly  
and it not a lot uh  
i i'm part of design perhaps  
yeah  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
excellent  
mm-hmm  
i shouldn't admit that  
more  
well my presentation is a bit uh <unk>  
yeah  
um presumably i have to  
but that in the worst case it will just be a static sort of arrow up button in the right hand topper corner of the display  
you don't use batteries  
and okay in closing 'cause we only have five minutes  
okay so voila  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but you'll hear more choice language at the point when we've all done a lot of work and and then we discover we can't use the session because of some thing we didn't think about  
okay yeah  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> i i guess that really you should be talking more than anybody else because you should be asking questions  
but when you look at the percentages  
or do you think it will i mean do you <unk> like  
but um unfortunately i i do not have any data so uh i just identified the functional components for that  
so to remind me so to to just add that analysis to yeah to to it  
yeah what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition  
yeah  
mm okay  
okay  
i mean no you if i just send them a thing saying the linguistics department is is having um a <unk> thing  
then yeah we could just uh  
well shall i go first with the users  
right  
yeah  
right  
yep  
<unk>  
that's what people want to do  
again i'm gonna take minutes  
mm-hmm  
is the project evaluated  
and <unk> maybe not too expensive well it's not my problem but well okay  
the agenda  
um and at this point we get try out the <unk> over there  
yeah of course we've got here  
you sometimes want to get a basically good estimate of the of the envelope  
so those four and of course the main  
and it suddenly becomes and there could be more than one construct at a time right  
do all you all know my <unk> mail address  
<unk>  
yeah  
and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the <unk> fashion in electronics uh  
i i like commas and then uh steve <unk> who's project manager had a look at <unk> i think it was my transcriptions  
yeah  
yeah  
participant four  
have you been uh counting the time  
each helium two optical depth i think that's elemental species  
no  
okay  
yeah  
so how do things fit it  
from the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more  
and that way we can focus on our form  
yeah  
it's a front  
like some uh little uh <unk> things or some hmm  
and something hmm  
yes okay  
yeah especially the power it really consumes because it should be all the time on and  
its image  
it's just sort of a very pale blue and a light up yellow  
that went okay yeah  
we just  
yeah  
you are okay  
if we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch  
no  
yeah true true  
yeah  
six point five  
whatever  
huh  
yeah it was stage one so  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
women would be going oh look at that <unk> cool it looks like a it's  
okay so which ones are we going to scratch  
no it's not it's not this this is very general yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
um we tested it <unk> uh with uh a hundred uh men  
yeah  
yeah it is  
so well we can probably wait until <unk> we have more knowledge on that  
then components  
well we designed it to be good looking  
but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the t. v. or something  
yeah yeah <unk> yeah i think i think you can do the festival you can just call like uh this there are different kind of again  
what the  
it still has <unk>  
is it and that was for half of it  
very standard one that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things  
okay  
but the problem like  
what t. v. shows are being watched um to influence our remote control  
or are we going for the regular  
so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons  
good work guys  
there's nothing like that  
uh-huh hmm okay  
it's not the uh abundance of it or any derived property it's just the strength of the lines  
so uh  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh <unk> huh  
no  
mm-hmm  
i would either  
mm  
it's bright yellow  
um the agenda for now uh uh are there any <unk> discussion questions  
or maybe just start with just two like without even combining them in any sophisticated way  
i mean it has to go through the gateway  
a cow  
is that right or is it just one  
are there any more cycles in this process  
because then we can also do the display about who's speaking  
um it is linked to this value yeah  
that's right yeah we need that yeah  
hmm  
yeah like a palm sized  
wee while when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and you know filling out silly questionnaires and things  
but i don't know i mean that  
we mark broad absorption line in that  
mm  
'cause i <unk> i don't think that glow in the dark material um like the actual soft plastic um costs that much more than other colours  
you need a on off switch um i don't know how that got in there  
i don't have it on mine though  
one of the number one complaints  
as far as i know that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements  
and um what we consider a <unk> gonna depend on our context i think  
exactly  
mm  
we have the right to use any frequency  
mm 'kay  
um and not <unk> right so more low tech and not too many buttons  
so i'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role  
industry and oh  
most of the words we use actually whatever we talk about are common uh words  
i i think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so  
uh i no  
not a not a normal shapes  
yeah but we're here it's uh an object  
i mean that was just an idea that i had  
i'm not sure it ah  
i think we're all happy now  
mm-hmm  
mm uh  
and it would actually help with the component build as well  
yeah we we had some trouble with the pen but  
uh yeah  
'kay  
yeah  
okay thank you  
and you can record it uh using yeah the the the back of the <unk> <unk> device  
okay uh i could put the microphone here  
so the point is you want to verify whether you can improve the recognition rate by using as an information the words that uh are contain in the slides  
spongy  
shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we <unk> resume that we'll <unk> use this idea david's proposed  
but  
then the remote control gives a signal for channel one  
and that shouldn't be there at all  
but that would probably be  
needs to be <unk> uh wrapped up fairly quickly  
it it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but then then again which colour should the buttons be  
so we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs  
um it must be uh simple to use very clear what to do and at the younger people  
i can say maybe there is a market for it i dunno  
and seven meaning no it doesn't <unk> at all  
yes i was <unk> it i was just thinking the same like it's it's so tempting  
still yeah  
well  
what's a good way of displaying two types of information in the in the colour display  
right which which we think is what's critical  
okay  
yeah and i think uh that will be exactly one hour and uh uh fill the tape  
think about it  
and the others were in your presentation right  
okay  
'cause i should <unk> i should check that  
um but uh the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most  
try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and i think that's a great idea  
i'll just i'll just minute that  
yeah  
yeah it's not done the very clever way but it does work  
um the eye link  
okay  
do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original  
right  
and it's got the <unk> the black and yellow and blue  
okay  
yeah why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the t. v.  
no no it was it was <unk> written there  
mar  
see it's a little bit more than <unk> single curved  
so what's something we could uh do to remedy that  
that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it  
if if it if it  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
i don't know if in another experiment maybe in another project if we want to have comments of different people around the table or <unk> elsewhere  
i if if this is a channel one  
so people are used to that kind of shape right  
oh yeah well th that's one i <unk> that's one i sent you  
i would think yes yeah  
yeah we'll kick your ass later  
yeah  
this one's so much tighter than the other one  
but if you want to install it personally uh  
or we can leave already i guess  
well what kind of coaching is that really  
fine  
yeah inside but this is for the coffee uh machine  
and how important is it to listen to it really until you've got the exact number of a things right  
no  
yeah  
always hard to tell until you know the costs  
yeah  
yeah well but i mean if you have to judge it's with respect to a given task  
yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now  
it's not silent  
uh uh already  
right  
that's right  
mm  
okay  
here's where i've i heard a another sound another false start  
yeah  
that's our boss  
and that would solve the budget problem  
a two okay because we have to  
um  
thanks  
oh right yeah  
is that sound reasonable  
yeah  
oh  
if we no okay scroll wheel  
let's keep it in  
okay so  
so it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy  
but <unk> what <unk> was doing  
i would uh recommend a yellow case  
but that's a pretty tight time scale then right 'cause it'd be for the fall we'd wanna know the evaluation  
no no no not at all  
i i kept the backups but those backups are the <unk> also on temp  
yep  
i mean given the slides but they are in no case they are extracting the text from the slides  
but it's not like um related to the corpus at all  
so he's <unk> proposing like this variable scale window <unk> uh kind of online for each segment  
yeah and it's it's not very precise  
mm-hmm  
and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty five euros money which we are thinking  
yep  
but the problem is i have my data on beefy and so i have to get it into the local temp directory and burn it from there  
yep  
okay  
well it it's yeah  
mm  
uh you could make a device but i'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs that you can put in normal batteries  
seems a little bit  
and  
red and green are actually the <unk> the easiest to discriminate  
yeah  
well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the <unk> in the project document folder  
a sponge  
it has to be at least curved from one side yeah  
maybe a good thing will be to make a plan to to we say we we won't set the deadline here  
no  
so we yeah we need to re <unk> the display then don't we  
well i don't use only digits  
one  
sample speaker  
mm  
which means the trap uh hundred and one trap trajectory shrank to say fifteen points with uh with still preserving the maximum resolution at the centre and throwing away most of the points near the boundary  
but unfortunately the technology defeated me so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the <unk>  
<unk>  
yeah mm-hmm  
yeah i think yeah  
yeah  
so that's quite cool  
but what what does it mean tied then  
wheel right where it's where it's <unk> into you know certain  
so this is again like uh that's kind of my p. h. d. work how in this system like how you choose the units and how you concatenate  
so there's a up arrow and a down arrow  
uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too  
that's right  
i think double a.  
um so a <unk> sort of larger bit sits in your hand and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah our team work is really strong  
so i made a i made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the <unk> most important requirements and trends  
okay  
they see the <unk> only the other guy's gaze right  
like just like this but in the shape of a banana  
because it it's of <unk>  
yeah  
yes  
mm-hmm  
here look at these numbers  
that's page one of my presentation  
yeah  
yeah just about  
okay  
<unk> just uh  
they don't see their own gaze  
yeah  
well the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons so we want it to be bigger than this  
like this one could be deeper maybe  
or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel  
less important  
all i think  
okay  
uh a graphical user designer so  
okay  
yeah buttons wear off  
yeah  
oh i have some figure  
mm-hmm  
because in the <unk> dialogues um they always say you know while laughing and we don't do that  
yeah  
you know  
and so are you looking for a final thing that just sort says between this time and this time you're looking at this object  
yeah yeah because everyone signs a consent form when they participate in the experiment  
yeah exactly  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> its size  
and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies  
uh  
it's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam i think  
yeah  
i don't know back in the day when they first came up with remote controls they had a reason for it being  
i <unk> no no  
okay  
i don't know what that stuff is  
yeah because they're right on your screen  
but not uh not <unk> every detail obviously  
take it down to just a scroll wheel  
yeah right  
the lapel  
above or down  
ah exactly  
yeah it's fancy according to me  
<unk>  
um so if i if i can use the model builder to automatically do that then that would <unk> that would save quite a bit of work and it'll <unk> save a few bugs  
cool  
yes  
yeah  
yeah that could be possible  
i don't i've i know of no products um that use speech recognition well  
um uh to be uh yeah kinda <unk> uh and uh the the the the other functions  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
i'm going to try to find that out  
i'll i'll be able to  
what are we doing  
um um i <unk> okay  
need to uh i don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh <unk>  
does it move uh  
hmm strange  
in the other application yeah  
mm-hmm  
what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable which i kind of like we yep  
mm-hmm  
well you're still in the play doh stage  
or or not  
um well  
no uh like i would draw it like this  
this one has channel volume and your <unk> and your power  
yeah  
we also it it just means that he's relatively lenient because i mean the reports were i think they were <unk> good reports  
uh  
uh i would like to  
to this cover you know  
so residual power he can compare <unk> so he after do after doing l. p. he can get a <unk> residual and then he can compare the power of the residual  
that's it  
mm  
um and that impacts cost  
well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so i will give a six for the easy to use  
maybe it's just a portuguese thing  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's correct  
just plug it  
it's a good question  
ah to regenerate an a. v. i. file okay yeah yeah  
like we all have a list of uh things that has to <unk> that have to be in it or how it has to be like  
well no not not you you can finish your slides before  
um  
alpha times the maximum of the other ones  
be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas  
in the end product  
electronics  
uh right you know it's worth taking a look at what it does and making sure it does what you want i guess  
oh  
the yeah  
or  
um  
i think it's a it's a great animal  
so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification  
yeah  
mm 'cause uh so for the information and action the uh the action here is not dialogue act but uh some kind of uh uh physical action uh that uh the uh <unk> uh i i is going to uh or has done in the past  
yeah  
uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway  
um so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group  
but  
are we um  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
'cause it should be there  
uh mo uh zap buttons most  
yeah i've never it's so simple but i've never seen it  
um we are going to use a a <unk> a project method uh during uh this development um which consists of three different design stages  
and  
how however our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television in order to keep things simple  
wow  
it's bright  
mm-hmm  
it's gonna be  
and the phase  
if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel  
yeah  
yeah not everybody is going to be scared of temps  
well we wanna make a multifunctional remote right  
yeah  
yeah  
so should we try and go for something that has <unk> larger buttons  
yeah i'm sure they'll be able to  
okay  
we we <unk>  
yeah but we already have the docking station which is  
or it's i  
i think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard  
goodbye  
okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of <unk>  
for example the i the mobile phones nowaday they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better  
first we tried to um explain why in this uh <unk> uh n. best list re scoring uh from the slides to enhance the speech recognition on the meetings data is not working  
mm-hmm  
no  
says robin thinking about cutting and splicing yeah  
no  
maybe you will get some information on that  
right  
okay  
so  
this design could be done with um  
of <unk> or directors  
i usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two digit number  
yeah but we yeah we don't have it so <unk>  
what you ha from your assistant  
i don't think that's a big problem  
yeah anyway no minus two  
um  
um well we should uh look into the design and the <unk>  
and then <unk> which is generally used by the people  
so and after that we have to make decisions what we will do  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
ex exactly  
well so it's a microphone array  
okay so this is the um overall budget for our  
no  
and i think it's fair uh it's fair uh setup  
no this is mm banana <unk> yeah  
you guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that i can see some demonstrations of over there  
mm-hmm  
okay  
means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays  
mm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
forty forty one is but see he has already  
right  
oh  
yeah  
but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text  
and we want  
ah it's maybe better if you leave it  
i just don't want to carry it off  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
and then we can just take that chunk out and do something with it  
so um yeah  
does that work without the sound cards  
six  
you have to use it  
um how much of the time they spend looking at the same thing  
yeah  
'cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions  
let's  
mm  
i mean uh it's um  
show us an animal  
so just  
yep  
yeah but the see there's so many different kinds of nebula  
and you  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah <unk> no idea no idea  
no okay  
that one  
i th i think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense  
you know i think we'd have to decide on the power options maybe  
six  
oh i'll go for a one  
that can be presentation where you have a <unk> a relationship between speech between things that are said and uh some textual documents some way  
uh i think they're they're about the same cost really  
volume  
important  
a semantic context yeah  
um and what well what score would a word get that just occurs once in all the corpus for example  
uh uh  
<unk> no the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it  
ah okay  
yeah  
mm mm  
that would be nice <unk> not to have anything yeah  
um the lack of broad line polarization  
volume up  
yeah so i think it's easy but  
we can dump the special colour  
and the light maybe  
mm  
can you go quickly please  
what are <unk> what are your first ideas for the new product  
i th uh i mean if it i think that's something that could perhaps be programmable though maybe have monkey as default  
so you're doing that on a on a per word level  
a push yeah  
but you got the all the <unk> files so  
mm  
no no  
it's a process isn't it  
okay but that's <unk> you can that's <unk> right  
mm i don't think so no  
about twenty minutes ago  
or a solar battery although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery  
we already know that as discussed earlier  
so  
uh  
or <unk> you can use the <unk> if you want  
so the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it  
mm-hmm  
well otherwise you'd get icons all over the place  
<unk>  
might it might be fine  
some sort of radiation  
yep  
and this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of l. c. d. <unk> and so we want to mo i mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for  
i didn't does any  
yeah  
yeah it's sorry  
oh  
so if it's dow it's <unk> uh yeah  
will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers  
hmm  
okay  
today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design  
yeah the last minute yeah yeah  
no but even the his coded like he just he he didn't do anything he just transferred it that way  
yeah  
yeah  
one two  
and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples  
um then i will uh bring in some some some new requirements i i got uh from the uh account manager  
we definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control  
they're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and  
so  
the soft x. rays or or the hard x. rays you can point to the red and the  
what we what we had  
more or less i did it maybe different way but kind of algorithm like okay  
oh it's the bar is working now  
well i i i think so  
it receives no information  
it lower bit rate  
hmm  
yeah  
yes i'm looking here  
but you know the data is rolling in  
mm  
then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is  
i dunno  
this one is user <unk>  
mm computer yeah  
yeah i should make a new constructor that lets you set the flag  
but th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for  
i think we really need to cut the meeting short  
yeah less sore on the ears  
uh  
sort of like a  
because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number  
you get the the the various options uh entirely explained  
my name's poppy  
okay  
because i understand this would have sense for i don't know speech coding where you want to preserve uh or you want to encode it into less frames  
no  
and making some analysis of different fruits we choose the ultimate form ultimate colours and uh ultimate smell of it  
we'll go <unk> could be here all day  
i had a hard time just to get the signals  
if you don't have one hey what kind of remote do you have  
programme  
uh  
so so it's uh the structure is such as uh vi video segmentation with uh videos in begin and then for each shot you have an i. d. well this is the terms from m. peg seven convention  
um i wanted to saw to see to do <unk> say something else  
um it's  
from the group  
but all the page linking to it are actually about very different topics  
yeah  
zero  
uh  
is it a duck  
that'll be fine  
li like write it be  
so you say mute he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute and then goes to the mute function  
go ahead  
um  
uh i mean if infra red uh circuit not not the radio frequency  
yeah  
food  
so they're not really the sort of people that are up for understanding um the intricacies of the committee i guess  
um findings  
yeah  
yep yep yep yep  
this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls  
oh i don't think i brought my diary up  
it's  
they'd <unk> it  
we figured it was okay if they were in the <unk> office which is a little bit noisy because they're only there for a short period of time  
thanks for being here  
what else  
yeah was it the speaker  
and the price of  
um okay fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons so that's going back to what you know  
okay  
which you could  
okay  
i think that uh  
which is the same area  
is that  
uh-huh  
i dunno  
here's what's gonna be going on  
a very interesting things i i i've seen on on on the one of the comp <unk> our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate  
yeah we can change the <unk>  
i couldn't create it in the <unk> and i think i've got this really strange cable  
mm  
but in other things i think it'd be really good  
then there would be suppose this point is say n.  
um so yeah  
no no  
and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler  
okay  
<unk> yeah mm  
i will put uh  
yeah  
fun  
yeah yeah at least nine ten button  
seven  
um  
because it  
mm  
i i read somebody's p. h. d. proposals yesterday and <unk> and it's saying well you could have a comma in here and one there and  
yeah  
because  
so that's that  
so we need a spongy feeling  
it could be oh uh i was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use  
yeah  
yes it is only for television but uh  
but we'll go into that later  
so that we don't manually have to parse times and entire things together  
mm  
yeah yeah you <unk> just you have to shake it around a little bit  
so it might actually be a better model again  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that a very small amount  
yeah <unk> that's wheel  
oh  
so um it's probably not going to be very difficult to yeah please  
and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs  
<unk>  
yes  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
okay thank you  
so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris  
yeah  
we gotta add up the scores now to see our total average  
that's what i mean to say  
yeah  
no sorry sorry sorry sorry we are doing a very wrong thing  
okay  
mm-hmm  
find out how it's how <unk> percentages of time they were looking at it or whatever  
so  
uh only just  
but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo  
um power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour  
then there is a chip and still the sender  
and that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it  
yes i i i <unk> i  
plus we would have to get the speech tools running on my laptop then wouldn't we  
we should have these things in our area  
um  
mm-hmm  
okay mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
does having both really up our costs  
of the actual project rather than the product  
because it's button we don't use very often but  
real media so there are many issues about that but yeah  
okay  
might have to draw a face on it  
what about you uh christa  
yeah  
are you planning robert  
yeah  
yeah  
um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here uh all must be saved  
right  
maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here  
uh  
yeah  
the autonomy  
here  
yeah  
you know maybe this isn't a simulation maybe this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just yeah they get  
would people miss them  
this is just a colour issue  
mm and the locator also goes away  
so um the the answer to the question might be nobody knows what the catalogue of exchanges is for real meetings because um or for these decision making meetings because you can't identify exchanges  
for sure  
um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source um the chip on print and the case  
just 'cause to just see how things work in that um and  
yeah we met in also in i. c. s. l. p. right  
mm-hmm  
every device has its own  
robustness uh-huh  
uh who's gonna give the prototype presentation  
hmm  
okay right let's get started  
which will be fun for toddlers right if they wanna use the  
yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume  
okay  
they've gone from big brick block things which is a remote control is to sort of slinky small things  
least you can easily see it  
i mean they want something user friendly so  
for r. s. i.  
yeah  
and exceed the requirements they're expecting of us  
is that i mean which way do you want to  
so the numbers the volume control and channel control and teletext access  
all you need is just the heat so they self destruct themselves  
so  
the clapping one  
according to the re to the new requirements i think we don't need that  
two  
this is just my notes on what to use  
and even though probably if there's a lot of over head in having two different files we can probably merge the weights into it off line  
the the problem was the <unk> running out and losing the um losing the remote  
yeah that's it  
um i've just had a sign flashing up saying finish the meeting  
yeah  
hmm mm  
yeah that's a i think even g. s. m. and all this g. seven two nine  
it's flat  
okay so we got some sort of idea of  
now the project is uh stand by  
um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up  
sure  
well this is my report which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that i was sent  
my name is xavier <unk> i'm the industrial designer and there are three main questions that i have to find an answer to today  
well if they're raised up buttons  
there's a chance they could be  
each of these frames  
ah okay right that makes sense  
it's amazing that everything was under temp  
well well why why why should we use a advanced chip  
i suppose you could do that  
you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to obviously  
so maybe it's more like a <unk> a five  
not yeah  
change  
uh touch screen interface um possibly having go to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen  
and it may be even more mechanical than that based on the um examples we're seeing from d. f. k. i.  
yeah i so uh i i think that that's too easy  
yeah yeah you can draw the picture of course  
well but uh  
yeah that's stupid  
but okay  
it's no no it's uh it's just g. m. m. word models  
right it would almost be like a ball  
it has to be developed but no but it that's that's our that's our killer feature  
yeah  
it doesn't look like a nuclear bomb  
right so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses  
usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions  
alright  
i don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll wheels  
nee  
him  
yeah  
you'll practice it before then won't you  
if it is possible we should really do it but we need that information  
and think we are on a good way  
um <unk> frequencies or something um as well as uh characters um different uh keypad styles and <unk> symbols  
yeah but that was it was our assignment huh  
and autism yeah  
i dunno if i can explain well  
like searching for channels and  
yeah  
so it did work  
okay  
you killed a monster  
no no no no  
but yeah i'll make sure  
they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build  
i couldn't see it at at all  
if we put expand all  
uh-huh  
okay  
so getting used to each other we can uh have a little fun then before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff  
yeah i think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company  
a minute please my uh laptop is uh oh there it is thank you  
now you have to  
what should we decide and do you know what i mean so  
and the rubber push buttons rubber case  
well <unk> why three  
one one  
i'll <unk>  
then warning uh there has to be a chip in our remote control  
like on the top of a cellphone the the little l. c. d. screen  
okay just leave it it's fine  
but we can't we can't make joe do this <unk> alright  
yeah sure  
just 'kay  
uh-huh okay  
tricky  
is that the zoom level changes  
i think we we can have like yeah a pear is good fit well or banana as you told  
yeah  
would that work  
i think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
then it's uh i it is at th hmm at what stage  
oh red  
yeah  
yeah  
a non word fragment and um  
word  
we should have an l. c. d. on the rem remote control  
right  
yeah  
but th but you also absorb them by <unk> you observe them by their <unk> feature  
it was interesting what came out like later like as i was doing the when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um  
i had no real specific ideas for this maybe we just the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe  
where yeah  
mm-hmm  
martin is fifty per cent  
no  
yes so we don't want that  
it's ada <unk>  
that's the detector uh for the  
whatever  
uh well we have a bit of a problem i think  
and it's only <unk> twenty five euros  
and uh as i suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours would be uh open to debate i suppose  
if fifty percent is normal  
so i'm not really sure what this meeting is about to be honest  
because it's gonna how many parts are there  
mm-hmm  
uh special colour now we leave it to the covers  
okay  
<unk> yeah  
yeah up down  
yeah  
great team workers  
okay  
hmm  
so  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
fine  
but that can be  
that's the advanced chip on print yeah  
and then either reuse some bits and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time  
yeah  
it it maybe it rubber or or yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um yeah  
oh et cetera  
to navigate it through th through teletext  
and then like twelve enter  
get up stand up  
if you want to go to england it will be able to understand english so  
um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip <unk> i would imagine  
ye yeah  
mm-hmm  
maybe and and get us a prototype  
so now celebrate  
yeah well that's our dilemma  
yeah  
but saying that isn't the same as saying we've seen that in a spectrum  
i think structure is probably what you're saying that each individual is structured to one particular task and one <unk> rather than controlling  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
you never know whether you've got these things on right or not  
oh no that's  
close to two  
no  
other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose  
sorry the chip's up there already  
i think we should use soft materials  
yeah  
actually they do  
yeah they are um high quality <unk>  
mm  
i think on top  
it depends but i think that low level will be you know it is an interim module  
i figured with the spam thing if you can't beat it join in  
yeah  
so we want to have simple and perfect shapes like i shown in these phones  
it's been a while  
have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired  
okay uh we now need to discuss the project finance  
true  
yeah  
the next one  
me too  
'kay  
uh i've  
uh uh the but it's not it's  
yeah i  
so just you push the button and we will  
yep not angular  
they're doing lot of tricks  
okay  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
good design  
mm yeah  
make it uh  
alright  
no  
so how far are we <unk> uh how <unk> how far are you getting raw text out of it do you think  
r. r.  
no one would would be interested  
and then you <unk> then you can delete uh  
if you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh t. v. programme  
but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should <unk> what actually consumer want what they operate rather than making it too complicated  
yeah  
so we have to <unk>  
yeah i actually did  
fashion to electronics  
eye  
or uh or a high speed train  
okay  
and you make it less expensive then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area  
right  
yeah  
we have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls  
well uh  
um  
okay  
yeah  
no  
it's a cat  
mm-hmm  
i don't know  
mm  
kick off meeting wow  
i think we did well  
um  
it's kind of an they were so not backed up it would just be a sentence like we did a survey this is what people said  
i think it's two too two too too  
yeah  
alright okay  
so if if the other performance is okay then we should really just load the whole thing in  
excellent  
th  
mm  
high balls  
oh i'm getting hungry  
he's he's actually um emailed me with a <unk> with a list of things he wants to discuss at length  
simple chip okay  
we go on to the next direction  
that that's that's my opinion  
so b. e. d. or b. b. d. or something and that's always the same group  
i have no idea what my favourite animal is  
basically it's it's completely programmable  
yeah you're right  
and is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of um  
and then you have to press function f. eight i think it is on your laptop  
let's try and keep this one on schedule  
well because they have teletext on it  
it's a duplication  
mm  
if you got a base which is uh as big as this  
okay so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody  
so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options <unk> if you press on the to  
yeah  
here you go  
um and i think that's about it in terms of my design um  
um do the controls now match the operating <unk> of the users  
great  
you can choose <unk>  
oh yeah  
<unk> yeah you know  
we have uh some limitations  
what i just <unk> we should really <unk> keep different <unk> completely separate for virtually all purposes  
like either gearing our remote towards kids where you could have lot of colours um  
maybe this is something we can stick to it  
often  
and we can ask help uh  
mm different to feel yeah yeah  
and q. s. o. is not yeah you're right  
and it says there's no uh there's no problems but something caused it to go wrong in the first place  
who actually like for this whole discussion i mean who of us is doing stuff that is happening on line and who of us is doing stuff that's happening off line  
and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points  
huh looks fucking boring now  
so it's in a region it's in a region  
i don't know  
yeah  
sense and simplicity  
because you could take that on ours out maybe  
you could select it all but then you can't erase  
you end up with some sort of phase representation which is some sort of <unk> decreasing function  
right  
yeah that sounds  
but if you're programming the colour of the t. v. do not display twenty other options that are possible  
mm  
so there's probably not much to talk about at the moment in terms of like talking about each other's stuff i mean beyond what we've been talking about yesterday  
with  
i would  
um i think we include mute but apart from that um i think we just we'll go for the <unk>  
and it should work with as many uh as possible of them  
it is really strange  
mm-hmm  
yeah so with this turbo button you can say skip over <unk> channels if uh you know if i'm if i'm going if i'm <unk> past them and you know  
remotes objects okay  
yeah i like that  
but i don't know if it's it's not really um the best way to do it  
we need some sort of display  
oh  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
i guess  
uh we use sixteen  
okay  
and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of  
okay  
right um if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power  
yeah  
hmm  
which i'm not sure is the same thing at the time that just i made more sense but i could see if they were really asking about us  
yeah you <unk> it every ti so every ti if people change you just change the appearance and <unk> <unk> you can keep  
where do you get the recording  
and then give them a week on top of that to get the actual abstract done  
yeah i must say that um the uh i <unk> can't remember what um <unk> you know phone service i was using the other day  
um it is  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah but if i paint with  
correct because people only use ten percent  
it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh  
is it everything ordered are the time stamps global or uh are they local at any point  
so that's that's probably uh a  
we don't need kinetic solar cells hand dynamo  
blue wing flux  
yeah  
mm  
that's a lot  
yeah yeah we are taking everything and that's i have taken it very wrongly  
yeah  
mm  
how <unk> little to no because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no  
probably  
at quarter to twelve  
okay  
mm yeah  
yeah  
and we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on  
good morning  
um got product evaluation as well  
uh not too big though  
what it will have to do is de register everything as time handlers and then update and then re register them  
uh  
and then there is a compression  
okay i think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward  
but then you are losing little bit of the bit rate let's say right  
mm-hmm  
so  
right  
um  
and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth  
right  
that might cost more though 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide well we provide the first batteries  
just enough that we can see whether it's interesting or what kind of area it fits into  
yeah okay  
he doesn't use opal model  
but that's just a little gap  
yeah  
lighting  
and that's the end of the meeting  
because these are things that um have been brought up some of them seem rather close like they overlap  
yeah  
and uh i i don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run so  
yeah but it's better it's better  
components design  
yeah that's th yeah  
yeah it's still  
okay  
that one was clear  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
no a little problem uh big problem  
yeah  
yeah  
what  
um and that's it really for the working design  
no leadership was uh  
it's it's not the most easy to use  
the button the buttons are <unk> during the night or you know you can see them in the darkness  
is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and  
they want everything but simply  
we did it this way before  
it could be at least i could provide some value  
alright  
yeah  
that you know that might be  
no i meant like  
well let's say at least they do it uh consistently enough that i think you can filter them out fairly well  
mm  
well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it  
yeah but it's <unk>  
um so so can i just ask <unk> <unk> now you just uh aligned <unk> uh sorry you circle the word in the in the outline which didn't  
like say just the underside or so then it can be done  
yeah but uh i mean <unk> even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones  
needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes  
what range  
they didn't have uh tapes  
i like it  
nee that's that's uh yeah  
the easy volume up button  
and i  
so if you <unk> flip it like this  
so i had some  
and the buttons have to be rubber  
i mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the l. c. d. screen which you could navigate with this i suppose  
so this why question doesn't even arise because  
yeah  
grapefruit  
l. c. well i'd when you used to mention the l. c. d. i'd think i wonder what that would be about  
otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us  
yeah  
but  
and uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting  
that's yeah  
yeah  
uh uh uh <unk> uh <unk> such as i mean um something you hold up like that possibly with a couple of buttons like that  
yeah yeah  
uh okay 'kay  
what or whatever does it  
uh  
the the style of these is terrible  
yeah  
but we we are uh  
um  
but that  
right  
so  
i would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double curved where it's curved on <unk> <unk> multiple axes right  
yeah  
i think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell  
what does it stand for  
they are and they they would <unk> the uh first um priority which is fancy  
that is quite different you you need to use a signal you have separated and uh do the type of analysis i mentioned  
so that's <unk> what we're doing  
we're looking at a  
otherwise it's you know a child comes and so  
yes  
um or at <unk> its functionality would have been of limited use  
and then you have uh what's the <unk> video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and  
uh it's the same as mine  
like with this was what it looks like  
so using the same scale two  
because normal <unk> uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly  
found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly  
well yeah but normally there is a a burning if you <unk> maybe you can play the shot or  
uh just a small thing  
well done  
it it i yes  
uh yellow  
yeah  
<unk> so who is going to take the remote control  
exactly  
yeah  
but uh the two basic sources that i found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic  
for the locator  
but i'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too but maybe it won't work but you'll see  
yeah also like this  
i don't know how easy that will be within the time frame but could be something we could maybe look into  
how many volumes  
yeah yeah we might get a  
it can be simply interpreted in the sense of saying uh okay i mean you have this channel open there  
that was  
<unk> yeah  
and also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements  
few buttons  
right  
okay  
i will be happy to do that  
then again i guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the i don't know how often they're buying televisions  
oh that's a  
they really want to have something good having a good design in their hands so yes all this  
um i i do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things  
well we can choose what we want  
um we put them in a in our um <unk> laboratory and got them to you know um play with remote controls and also to complete  
participant four yes  
mm-hmm  
i guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of  
it may be easier to <unk> to uh <unk> directly by some some matching process  
mm  
yeah and  
so i'm kind of thinking you know like those phones that they have  
i'll still give it five  
but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality  
yeah  
um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh i want you to mm  
uh i i in the in the ma yeah but it <unk> i mean  
okay  
so it's almost yeah  
course not  
any company logo  
yeah  
durable that's good  
even children can draw  
yeah  
right  
okay welcome to the detailed design meeting  
and i'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me  
mm-hmm  
right  
i think it should be wire wireless re remote con  
or is it uh too expensive  
um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff  
mm-hmm  
so i say u. c. and i feed that to uh l. e. d. which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component  
yeah  
line width  
yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi colour so it it doesn't look too childish perhaps  
for twenty five  
and you're saying you need a a label for each segment  
yep  
mm  
and since uh we cannot start immediately with the measures i think that's the best thing to do  
they uh they also tend to have a funny funny shape beeps  
mm no i'm not sure  
because that might yeah  
so but it'd be good to you know  
mm  
and um we'll reconvene in thirty minutes  
do you need the um <unk> for this  
okay so have it more make it more durable actually  
there you go  
mm-hmm  
um you can have multiple scroll buttons um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated but um it's it the technology is there  
beep beep beep okay  
uh su you suggested doing likelihood but at that time and i can't remember what my problem was with that  
okay  
um i have a lot of the information there  
somewhere over here  
magnetic  
so we can  
but here what i wanted to <unk> it is just you know the bulb and  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
you're talking about <unk> or you're talking about  
yes i mean i <unk> just uh needed to have this value now to relate um <unk> how yeah  
just down here  
so the general topic uh is about uh interactive table um disappearing computer um what is the other one  
yeah  
okay and uh the <unk>  
uh yeah  
yeah  
'cause i mean like uh if we i mean how good is the speech recognition thing  
do you guys  
number of uh frames  
i i i know you missed a meeting and <unk> and so there there may have been you missed the one in t. n. o.  
given that we can argue about it for ten minutes it's probably not that clear cut  
well i think we've all learnt stuff from each other like the <unk> um yeah  
colour yeah  
but it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah  
we have about ten minutes left in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts  
i hope so  
so i think we're we are quite willing to split and put say maybe one visitor with maria and david uh fifty per cent in the other room with the second visitor  
um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control uh um you know one some sort of typical usage  
we've only got about another four hours left  
so i think the costs are within the budget  
whereas channel selection which is very high relevance is used the most  
two or three  
do we remember  
yeah i agree  
um we will figure that out  
i think hynek has got ma many papers or some papers over that  
alright  
integrate  
yeah  
hmm  
press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings  
i hope i saved it  
yep  
that's cool  
yeah  
yeah  
it shows the most used functions and they are relevant but  
okay  
i li yeah top marks  
like a little sound  
right  
are you getting it online or is it on sky  
yeah an yeah  
circular  
so i mean it's something that you could conceivably represent in some sort of low sort of <unk> you know low bit rate representation i guess  
sorry  
in your home directory  
there's flat there's single curved and there's double curved  
okay  
or  
so uh it's very unclear to me why you think exchange of information is more principal <unk> uh did you i mean what did you have specific schemes in mind there  
right i think we need to make a a decision here  
no no but the uh um that's what sebastian said  
yeah i know  
to to these covers and <unk> now try to invest in the in in the features  
yeah  
oh <unk> right it's actually next week  
yeah  
oh alright  
um one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of um like different kinds of uh v. c. r. <unk>  
okay anyway  
is it better like that  
uh you can't attend multiple session at the same time so  
and i can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction  
yeah  
on the other side we want to have something new  
yeah like the search results in there  
so what we what we would fit in into the <unk> files would it be uh um a value for each utterance  
who because if you want to go to kinetic you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat  
so we have the regular chip on the print which is one  
uh no  
because i think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what yeah  
and the fire wire port  
and i have a test clustering of marbles  
yes  
so for example you can change you can change a number to take which one okay  
but who is the one who is using these results which we publish and try to make  
yeah  
yeah  
as uh uh uh separate buttons  
so i mean we could maybe put two again on them  
so i'll take this out  
so this one of the problem  
th then the <unk> the problem is not the geometry it's the um i you need more than one basically  
to a certain position in the in the words file  
must um see <unk> what mine preferences are for which channel so i can zap <unk> to  
but  
yeah  
i just thought of that  
uh-huh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay alright  
so  
ah  
every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything so to help with these you have we have the <unk> here  
yeah  
no nebula counts doesn't it  
we're interested in in something more general but they suggested uh you know going i a little bit into a a niche  
yeah i think that  
mm 'kay  
mm-hmm  
okay so basically we have two fixed points  
even less than that yeah  
so i think that um  
it's quite difficult but yeah  
blue  
right forty minutes for this meeting so a bit more time than the last one  
mm  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yes  
i think  
<unk> uh can you separate these uh these  
right  
yes the difference is with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up  
and you can also have front with uh with fruit on it  
uh the audio record ten seconds in was the same as ten seconds into the eye tracker record so that we didn't have to do any extra hand work  
you train it for a certain uh for a certain phrase  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well maybe if it if it helps us pack more people into the offices because they have a private lounge  
the buttons  
ah oh yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's more realistic and um yeah probably it can help go in this direction of saying well let's see what happen between speech and slides  
okay  
what our what our project was was to come up with the product basically  
uh commands and mechanisms that basically user uses to control the operator operating system  
this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine  
it might be good indeed if we start <unk> building some experiments like this still to have a password  
mm-hmm  
which is a quite a significant number  
mm  
yeah and i am at the moment fiddling around with my data and not quite seeing how i get to a sensible abstraction level you know  
or like uh you have a menu button you press yeah or otherwise you have a menu button  
<unk> you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal <unk> remote control so <unk> you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television  
simplicity and powerful  
so here is this remote control  
alright  
under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk  
yeah  
yeah  
can we keep them  
but  
yeah  
if if we could have a technological something  
yeah  
i i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control they use their own th th with lot more functions  
yeah you're right  
right can i  
i'm just asking you  
you want these options to  
but what about the redesigning  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
autonomy  
the oranges and the the bright yellows and the <unk> colours part of the fruit and vegetables um  
what's your opinion  
that just seems so clunky and  
okay  
up is channel up  
now next  
cool  
it's it's it doesn't really make a lot of  
yeah that can't be in  
right  
okay  
although i was talking about conti yeah continuum <unk> continuum flux it should be in  
so maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable or i don't know different options for female male target groups  
not that that's not something you can point to  
it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah yeah in that case  
so  
um all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately and work out the most  
yeah  
no it's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i <unk> i couldn't create it  
so  
if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them that would've been a lot easier  
yeah cohen yeah yeah  
well i was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse  
mm  
mm-hmm  
but  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
oh no but we then we get push buttons from half a euro  
mm-hmm  
uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part  
the office chairs it sort of has comfortable sofas and armchairs and things like that where you can just go and relax  
yeah they're all the same  
okay  
um because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard  
oh right it's it's from the left to the <unk> it's  
yeah so that  
right  
i know  
um  
and it's  
put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form  
okay  
home  
okay  
yes  
checking their own transcription  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> left yeah left and then uh i have to kick you out  
see summary there  
and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add  
fancy  
so so <unk> was here for half a year maybe or even more uh and uh started work with petr who also <unk> just came  
whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much  
mango shape  
so when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited  
yeah but i can do it from that session can't i  
yeah  
out  
okay  
mm  
so so that mean you need the blink corrections part of the analysis then  
i th i'd like <unk> it to be in but i can't see it happening  
but but the uh with um there is one parameter that is very <unk> <unk> i can't remember what is the parameter uh  
and then sort of the meeting is the whole thing and the chunks are the individual segments  
a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages  
mm  
well you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons  
excellent to match the rabbit  
it's an angle  
in i think i read it  
do it via the email so that rather than coming you know if you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine  
um we're going to do that with a seven point scale  
'cause i'm trying to think that it's probably the small the actual mouse icon is so small  
volume they are uh use a lot  
in your direction  
uh i think it makes more sense to go for the whole corpus because the meet the um the i. d. <unk> gonna have gaps and stuff in them otherwise  
yeah <unk> 'cause that's what i'm gonna need as well  
making sure that it it's usable that as a um  
yeah the the price the the number of items and the the sum  
yep  
we're not talking  
six five four  
um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top  
yeah  
okay  
and <unk>  
mm-hmm  
i want to fill it in but uh  
it's generally in the form of infrared or  
a <unk> i don't <unk> oh oh well  
i mean is the okay  
yeah  
in your tie in  
yeah  
techno  
yeah  
yeah  
i got it on my screen and it was uh higher  
yeah  
uh yeah  
then you are doing in different domain  
<unk> you would uh assume  
or maybe you will get that information uh yeah  
and do people actually want that  
oh three sixes okay yeah  
if they look good then that's a good way of doing it as any i suppose  
um i suppose it should have a mouth as well sort of  
yeah yeah  
uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is i think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple  
mouse  
why  
yeah i like that idea  
it's hard to believe  
okay  
i mean i can easily just well however many thousands are on that uh dutch web site you found  
yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really  
okay  
but uh when i heard those that presentation they didn't do so much new  
but um i'll <unk> i'll  
just all be sort of spongy  
i mean i guess we can  
true  
no they can be complementary  
are you ready  
yeah that's right  
so you <unk> so <unk> is a professor but she's only she's only fifty per cent time  
hmm  
a quarter to one maybe  
we do  
this one has no obvious connections to fruit but because it's round and molded  
there might be one other problem with the transmission um in particular right now since we're talking about voice recognition  
seven  
yeah but that's a kind of crude guideline  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
<unk> so um uh you kinda got the idea here  
yep  
oh so those vary in size  
it's more true than false about a two  
it was really good to do it  
yeah  
yes  
<unk> seven was th the maximum yeah  
so th  
it's not recorded is it  
yeah  
it's a pig  
sorry about that guys  
and then we can move on to the more advanced features  
hmm  
so  
then uh if it's not a back channel or uh something similar then it's a dialogue  
yeah i can't can't really tell you  
associated  
the turbo button  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
no  
well we <unk> yeah  
um where no well that's more like the buttons where they have to come  
yeah  
so next been here  
which i would probably say it was but then i've never looked at i one  
that's it  
yeah  
and so the th the twenty five euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price  
yeah mm-hmm  
yeah  
no eleven  
well we alternatively we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space  
blue tongue  
okay but this real this uh big <unk> uh distinction between this type of remote  
it would actually be nice to demonstrate that in a place where we're controlling whether you have language or not  
shock and worry at uh i think yeah there's a there's a mailing list uh and mm-hmm yeah  
mm-hmm  
yes but we do agree that we keep this at the centre because it's basically the most important function  
so <unk> maybe it may help you but it yeah  
mm-hmm  
no  
'cause that would be sort of the nice way to sit at home and have it forward the sound at the lowest bit rate to you  
you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing  
uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra red  
with a smile on it it's very important  
mm  
okay  
yeah yeah yeah  
so they also get to pick  
well i suppose we'll  
mm-hmm  
you killed my father  
'cause that would affect the way that we market it  
yes  
image processing  
but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that  
i think that was that became clear  
yeah but suppose you got a cold  
depends how much we sell  
okay  
i think you watch a video of it kind of  
indeed you could provide like the a. v. i. to the clients  
so i'll have to put that oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there  
it's way more practical yeah  
okay  
that's mine  
our sources  
uh the shape of it actually does uh  
but <unk> what <unk> what special  
yes  
also also you risk the hinges here  
that way  
i remember  
i it's it's reasonable <unk> quite yeah  
okay  
so <unk> where do we identify the components of our uh product  
oh okay  
yeah we'll talk about the lights later  
there's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero  
that's handy  
mm-hmm  
um cool  
<unk> yeah that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me  
right and they said they wanted voice recognition  
yeah  
map is it a good word  
this it just get two sectors that are higher than others no  
ah  
because i think i have kept those labels all those things in the speech directory  
<unk> so the average  
yeah  
'cause i've got time today  
i thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do so that's why i suggested we get in this  
mm-hmm  
excellent  
mm-hmm  
i'm not <unk> yeah  
yeah  
<unk> yea the scroll wheel is dropped  
i think it can't be implemented but maybe  
yeah  
yes  
yeah but uh uh they're not useful  
okay  
mm  
'kay but the problem now is that the  
right  
okay  
i took this off our corporate website  
alright okay  
just checking that  
yeah yeah yeah  
sorry  
yeah  
or like an alarm clock  
like for instance yeah  
it's  
yes that's correct  
but i mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour  
perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal  
but if it's a damped lyman alpha spectrum you'd mark damped lyman alpha because in the spectrum  
it would make sense to  
okay  
imagine since we obviously don't have that  
well of the designers what are they  
you have it more like this  
yeah i did say that  
so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote but we can try  
i think that <unk> that would be quite hard to learn to use it  
i when we use a <unk> a doubled curved case  
<unk> yeah  
less context what you mean  
well i guess that's up to our industrial designer  
no i don't think i think  
okay  
and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that  
but mm  
well i was more thinking about the fruit colours that the <unk> showed us before  
it's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it  
and maybe the l. c. d. and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing  
right  
adaptable  
yeah so it must should be possible  
under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things  
uh  
for instance you couldn't see this  
uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions  
mm-hmm  
so i th  
yeah like like yeah  
oh yeah yeah  
yeah  
thank you  
hmm  
the okay  
yeah  
hmm  
you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your t. v.  
of the nite data system now so that maybe as soon as i've understood that we find ways of doing that in within the nite framework already  
maroon  
and um and i try to do what jean marc uh described to give you a first feedback on the different cards  
great  
to get the stuff done  
the tools we have here so that we can all use them  
i alf i also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it  
well we'll uh consider it uh  
some kind of um truncation maybe if you attach a number to each word and say that it should omit the last part  
yeah i mean if you if you if you present the components of what it it's based on  
i guess it i it sort of a grey isn't it  
i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like <unk> prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product  
so the the lowest layer would be the first two questions  
you mean mm  
do they have slides or anything along that i don't think they would  
it's just <unk>  
yeah that's possible  
i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology  
okay  
but exactly  
size  
any any more things  
so i think that would still make it a nice product  
just one  
so so you just compare uh those two distributions so of d. one and d. two okay  
and specially it definitely could fits the the real product what was the what's the company name  
so draw it  
sure  
uh i just assume that's how ni <unk> had set it all up  
would you like to share  
okay  
yeah  
it's not going to take much space also  
yeah  
right  
let's say that  
mm  
and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel which you can incorporate buttons into  
yep one over another  
yeah yeah  
'cause in a mouse your <unk> in a position to roll it  
mm  
and games  
what if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on  
so would it not be best to rather than i mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were  
um  
so um i think yeah it's normally the nominal capacity of this i think it's uh eighteen people  
hmm  
yeah but you were gonna try and figure out how to overlay something on top of the video that or no  
so at least uh this is not at the electronic level  
i think we can do three  
yeah  
i think um the the focus of it a lot was the <unk> as opposed to the to the <unk>  
ah okay  
oh  
you're right in that but i i guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use  
but but you are you are really in a frequency domain  
but  
mm  
yeah  
as far as the infra red signal do we have control over  
yeah  
that's true  
but this phase is different from your carrier no  
so in numbers case what do you really need like  
mm  
so i think as long as you build an algorithm that respects whatever <unk> in the file rather than imposing its own structure  
uh  
okay  
alright  
see you at the next meeting  
that's text  
yeah  
they're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras m. p. three players telephones  
yeah  
if they're looking around it uh rather than just holding their gaze steady or um and longer on it  
okay you think one what do you think  
left left a bit left a bit that one yep  
well we have good reasons for it so we but we can still put a  
huh  
thank you  
so anyone else have something to say  
we probably might have to have a different word for it  
for instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so i think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another  
numbers  
i yeah  
yeah that's what i was about to say  
oh yeah  
your design um the user interface is still quite open you could go for quite an interesting design  
yeah  
well i suppose <unk> if the mar if our um  
alright  
i'm not gonna project my email  
we have a blank sheet  
yeah  
yeah i know what you um  
well on my machine his machine or this machine maybe  
mm-hmm  
well while we're on past things is there anything else you wanna tell us about the prior part of this  
mm  
yeah  
findings  
you can probably reach  
who starts  
we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them  
oh alright  
um we have to decide on our our user interface which is his department but the in user interface is also a major component  
okay  
ah okay  
or is it just an artifact of the way we <unk>  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
well maybe they shouldn't watch so much t. v. then  
hmm  
i think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think  
yeah i i call it contrast  
okay  
yeah that's well i think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also so  
well we haven't got a big banana but  
should we have that somewhere on the packaging  
lights lights are  
yeah the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all  
or or with the volume selection  
yeah we tried it earlier  
you have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh  
hmm  
uh  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
um  
yeah  
um  
<unk> oh yeah either that if that shouldn't be in neither should either of those  
'kay that's fine  
i think th i think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to  
you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone  
okay  
janus  
so it's gonna be you already have a t. v. but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something  
right no that's a zero  
newsflash  
well our marketing expert  
mm  
so i take three on with l. c. d.  
mm  
of the shape  
so  
um i've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls  
no mm no  
oh menu alright  
sixteen point three  
it's uh  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
or only this to to scroll  
it has to be capable for zapping uh  
alright  
okay it's uh  
i don't know what we are going to do with that  
it's a bit hard to guess  
it's quite good no  
they were exploring the thing as opposed to they were simply alright there is it there it is  
we can't if they suddenly if they decide to get a part of a mold we don't know we can't know why until they do something with it  
so you have functions that are <unk> uh duplicating  
is that used often  
yeah  
oh how long was our meeting supposed to be  
so would that solve the problem basically  
oh i don't think i was doing that  
so wednesday is the only day left that he can make  
so everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket  
okay before starting a ne a new page  
so um nice to see you again  
mono mono recording on microphones  
okay then i say three  
uh whoever wants to go first is <unk> fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting possible directions  
on <unk>  
you can do it with some heuristics and you can learn it from the task results in or combine the two so <unk> that's kinda straightforward i think  
mm-hmm  
no not not the other one this one  
i guess design would go best  
because the <unk> problem comes from the the grabbing from the d. v. tape in in <unk> in d. <unk>  
i mean if if people are looking at the slides  
and uh in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design  
yeah  
and it's it's unlikely to be exactly fifty percent in one object and fifty percent in the other  
is it a rabbit  
uh message to the television  
yeah  
ah ah  
okay number ten  
yeah  
oh  
well what we were what we were thinking about is oh c. d. m. a. i mean there is the <unk>  
mm  
it's it's trendy okay  
faster  
yay  
mm-hmm  
that we could have essentially the same shape but just have it flattened  
so use that for acoustic training  
you have it in your palm like this and you can watch uh watch the screen  
mm-hmm  
but we have to incorporate it  
they don't need special colours  
and i mean it seems to me that <unk> should have some kind of so if if your dialogue act <unk> says there's there's a segment here  
that's enough  
and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine and it wouldn't confuse the numbers  
mm  
uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote i think are in my department  
so the other stuff might be a little too a little too <unk> for some people  
now we have a few new product requirements  
<unk> or for all those secret functions  
sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape  
um i have some <unk> yeah  
r. s. i. mm-hmm  
yeah my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit talking about circuit boards  
um so that's kind of our our brief as it were  
mm-hmm  
so maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes  
expensive it's gonna be get uh  
so <unk> uh four  
and finally the conclusion is uh he here we saw how we can get uh some more informative <unk> by introducing extra knowledge like prior and <unk> information  
yeah especially because i mean that's that's that's only done like once every time the selection changes right  
well these are some examples but we'll talk about them later  
but yeah  
yeah  
yeah that's slick isn't it  
it was developed for him like he was just first tester i think of the system  
and so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions  
but if the line peak is increasingly shifted you'd  
and so that um once you go through all the <unk> um speech regions and all the um non speech regions  
um well i'll be there from twelve  
a feature  
okay  
the parental control the games and the voice recognition  
we weren't doing <unk> shapes were we  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
our question of the style we should remember that our company  
yeah  
and others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed  
well i think it's pretty much in the middle  
well uh <unk> function of remote control is just just you know change channels is its main function  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh on the buttons  
no i'll i'll i'll give it a two  
yeah uh or for example why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below and the and the channels and volume control  
and so for us uh this is quite easy  
i don't  
um the shape of the control and <unk> the buttons should be located on the control  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> you agree  
well i always thought they get tired after marking up the dialogue moves so they <unk> never bother with any higher level dialogue structure  
yeah  
so how would this menu function work  
i think something coloured yeah probably  
f. eight  
but it it's it you you could say that it possibly doe it probably does  
we don't really know  
but  
it's like man we we can't have the locator thing  
yeah  
i think that's right  
yeah  
okay so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our <unk> um necessities the <unk> one is that  
we're getting to specific statistics here  
just because we're having a different <unk> um important measure  
and it would give you that  
it'll wear off  
um channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings audio settings which are only used very infrequently  
yeah  
the other legs are on the other side  
um  
that that related to the actual buttons but it does affect the printed circuit board  
cool  
but  
lemons  
and i  
it was yeah the last time it was for me it was good the course from my from one special reason  
um i don't know  
it's a dog  
yeah  
i i like that they're so unique and individual i guess  
i don't  
and this is the frequency  
yeah  
mm um  
if it's an emission line data would we put it in  
okay  
ah it's my turn  
i've seen people talk about them as separate classes but i don't really know what that means  
more  
then we could <unk> or it is a new construct 'cause it has a new list of a new cumulative list of parts right  
and this answer is inconsistent with that answer  
right okay  
um uh uh i'll think about that  
i it it wouldn't count as a source type  
i don't know <unk> it would be too hard to really i mean we could do it but  
uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting  
it's a micro array okay  
to discuss  
mm i'd give it a four  
good job  
which i'm defining as scroll wheel  
okay  
because so if the whole signal was uh steady somehow and it it would be able to be <unk> by l. p. model  
i mean it's it's about the same  
well done  
but if they had a fixation on  
yeah that's the empty one  
um yes  
first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light and you <unk> when <unk> you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control  
clunky okay  
so she <unk> she transcribed that as would  
<unk> method  
do you want 'em to roll it like that  
um does it have to have a  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah right  
um  
and well i i think we've got two options  
yeah  
and um that way you don't have a lot of buttons over  
uh when  
yeah  
yeah  
there are bookshelves in there but it's not really a library 'cause everyone at the moment  
cool  
<unk>  
you did you  
no no  
okay  
think that's well within the normal bracket  
no how long you would have to program something  
okay  
mm-hmm  
looks like you're in okay  
we're starting to close  
that'd it'd be like uh half an hour's work in a day to run the recognition scripts  
it's  
which one is yours technical functions or functional requirement  
right  
no no no it's not  
n. e. z.  
yeah  
oh in  
yeah uh another issue is like again the computational issues no  
you had <unk> two topics  
it's a scroll yeah it's a wheel  
<unk> okay  
really  
this is a coherent chunk then <unk> <unk> you know <unk> i mean maybe they could work together to do a better job than  
then we need to <unk> make it a little thicker because i have to put all the electronics in it  
also considering that the <unk> research <unk> has been carried out by real reaction i'm a little hesitant as to like  
we have a i guess we have a presentation each 'cause i've got one  
was it was it specified that we went for the biggest  
you wa  
maybe unless something comes up then we should i think  
<unk> <unk>  
okay  
and yeah um and i like cocktails especially pink ones  
hmm  
meeting adjourned  
it it works for them and and they are close to like industry like uh you know  
you asked for three <unk>  
but it might be quite cool to have a combined measure  
but you can also say that when you say something it does some function  
and therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day  
okay  
mm  
but it's pretty close  
once again forty minutes so uh let's start  
yeah  
exactly  
uh  
i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition so i don't expect that to be a problem  
<unk> i do i don't get the point because it's would be  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
double curve is you have curves on both the sides if i'm right  
yes it is  
so we just had a speech and you had decompose a speech into such segments temporal segments which were stationary inside  
okay  
but do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons  
mm-hmm  
in paris and milan we uh asked different people uh differing in age and in income  
i just have to read up on it  
mm mm  
mm  
oh  
next week  
i i guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before  
yeah  
so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control  
uh what can a t. v. do  
what kind of ideas for <unk> a future schedule what  
next  
uh i will  
ah you didn't generate the okay the real media  
yeah  
but  
yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important  
what's that mean  
yeah  
so this is so this is this is much more than <unk> taking this technology bringing it to the remote control and using it  
ex at least exchange might be uh one kind of uh important information for that kind of  
sure  
wait is it like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something  
it just comes along  
bright colour  
yeah  
so we've got forty minutes  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no i i think we would just take the segments that are already that were yeah there's um this segments file  
so yeah  
'cause i get i get quite prolific with my commas at times  
it could be fully kinetic energy  
oh that  
okay  
yeah  
say mahogany or so  
i would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five  
i think it i increases  
so  
and still have lots of room at the bottom where you can put your hand  
f. b. s. objects shouldn't be in there  
right  
uh we have a seven point scale from uh true as well  
participant one  
and uh no uh <unk> only the the drawing uh was very difficult  
mm-hmm  
um uh okay  
mm-hmm  
ye yeah we we don't have too much information about it um  
yeah  
so i clean up  
okay  
maybe more on  
so that's my animal  
you know not very much  
let me see if i have that words x. m. l. file  
mm-hmm  
means the big one has to be sufficiently big  
maybe like a mute button that sort of thing  
yeah  
you you have this going behind your ears the yeah  
yeah  
yep news headlines  
yeah i guess for the so when we have the display will we display the whole series  
and i think that for example for the <unk> it would be good to have  
yeah  
that's in  
yeah i mean there's there's so what we yeah one one for one  
<unk> we don't need both  
yeah  
so simple chip is okay  
so there is one that is one thing  
um you know people want something new something technologically innovative and different  
huh oh right  
so it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh  
'kay hello everybody  
uh  
a mute button  
yeah yeah  
uh and this is uh only for uh drawing  
mm  
sort of give an idea  
yeah  
i'm doing like finding similar segments basic latent semantic analysis  
um we'd like to um  
it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device the menu system ought to be um  
okay  
oh great  
and you would say five seconds may seem a lot for audio and video  
uh i think uh and need to as well  
yeah  
uh well from a marketing uh perspective um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements  
right  
yes yes  
so <unk> my plan was to have two streams and i i i well  
okay next  
case materials are plastic  
i think that would make it very complex  
yeah it's yeah  
i haven't heard any complaints yet so  
but uh no no no  
yeah  
ready  
yeah but some pa  
yeah  
'kay shall i pass on to you now  
no way  
yeah  
content  
as in i just don't understand much about how difficult it is to do to do different things  
hmm  
decline with age mm  
<unk>  
the other one's <unk> like the smaller size and that isn't stereo  
so we have directly <unk> wave files with uh particular noise  
yes  
but shorter i <unk> i believe right i mean it's bad to explain  
not really yeah  
i believe i can fly  
so why does it fail then in the first place  
mm  
so you can  
i don't think we ne really need the scroll <unk> wheel  
this is just details and how to get stuff home from what we can probably just look at that together when we're meeting  
mm  
um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people  
increase that 'cause we can't see the  
keep going  
yeah  
okay can he get it all by himself this time  
there are y. <unk>  
um so they need to be included um but i've got some pictures here of some leading ones  
i i'm not sure but i'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u. s. b. might be prohibitive  
yeah  
because real real reaction sells more products than only remote controls  
i with uh teletext if it wasn't <unk> very important it was but you also now have colours  
hmm  
i have no idea what  
yeah  
that's uh a six  
yeah that's a  
go on  
okay  
that's very small  
mm-hmm  
okay  
or just  
mm-hmm  
beep  
okay  
yeah  
oh so you're managing that okay and you haven't run into c. v. s. before  
okay  
because we have to decide this  
and basically they came they said the channel volume and power buttons had the highest relevance to users um note that only power was very infrequently used  
and the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing  
uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that i may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one i'm gonna have one  
uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear  
yeah okay it's okay  
yeah  
yes but it should cover all the functions so possibly just an idea that popped in  
then we should probably be able to basically that means we focus on on the interface first sort of  
so  
or  
so you you don't use the speech <unk> in that way  
and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of  
that's why you don't have it  
mm  
not really familiar  
um the challenge is that current trends right now across the board in fashion in furniture  
how about  
we <unk> it it's a board uh decision  
okay after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface i think most of the points which i want to are already covered here  
yeah i think so  
yeah that's my presentation  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
maybe you can go to the <unk> if you have some drawings to do i don't know  
okay  
okay <unk> how do you feel about that  
and maybe the actual controls are inside or something  
it's not fair to get work out of somebody for free  
the first is a circle and the second is a triangle <unk> piece  
normal coloured buttons  
so mm uh  
yeah but then we've got money left  
no that that's that's yeah  
this is a interactive area and this is a mono logic area because and we could come up with what kinds of measurements you need  
well i suppose have to wait to your i guess  
so then if we <unk> <unk> do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons  
i guess so 'cause i found some interesting things  
but you <unk> you can talk to it  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh i wouldn't bother more than one or two certainly  
but it's still fashion  
four maybe  
optional in  
yeah and mono stereo  
a dog  
um but there'll be i suppose just some purely eye movement stuff we could do  
how confident are you about the finding these things  
yeah  
or are we doing it on word level like the information density calculation  
mm yeah  
yeah  
i think it wouldn't be uh <unk> and maybe we could think of a visitor too here  
it's more like a dinosaur  
well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so but um um  
and it's the whole thing's made of rubber is that  
there are many simple things which you can do like uh <unk> <unk> for example  
i think so as like but you were supposed to have <unk>  
but do yeah yeah  
but it's a good feature i guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it  
<unk> i missed  
i say <unk> at least unless we get any information but i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a <unk>  
yeah yeah  
yeah within the constraints the  
okay um  
yeah  
that could handle both uh like <unk> wheels as well as uh l. c. d. and yeah  
it works  
okay  
okay  
okay  
yeah maybe we've <unk>  
so i mean perhaps if you had slides and and presentations to do with something that was off topic  
um there there is going to be a checking in procedure  
yeah  
one  
but it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control  
like i saw half page code samples which effectively just displayed a tool tip and i didn't have the time at that point to get deeper into that  
but  
yeah  
um  
so i mean the the only sorts of noise you're gonna have to deal with uh is is is hiss or impulsive i would say  
yeah  
um so back to decisions  
and they've been declared hub  
five  
yeah  
okay so that'll be a seven for a.  
on the back yes you you can yeah push that in so that it is always be there  
but after a while people may wanna return it  
oh yeah yeah yeah  
uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway  
maybe th <unk>  
translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy  
um  
scuba  
something like this  
the evaluation criterion  
five or six  
so it's easy in your hand uh indeed  
mm  
i mean we are trying to promote a remote control but we wanna keep the company brand as well so  
oh <unk> you mean the phase of that uh of that carrier  
doesn't work very well  
mm  
on their product doesn't mean fruit is cool  
okay okay  
so maybe  
very good let's have a look  
the perfect design for those only those buttons  
and a bit bit old school style renaissance medieval kind of things  
yes this industry is again different like yeah  
woo hoo  
mm-hmm  
so you can you can do it  
especially the big ones the big brands so  
oh no i li i th i thought something else that we <unk> um we just split i need somewhere to split  
ah it's it's okay  
yeah  
like the one we have here  
okay  
i have no idea exactly what they're talking about but that's what they told me <unk> flat curved or double curved  
okay  
um also we've got the integrated <unk> which is what we're most familiar with  
'cause i think i mean the audio is a <unk> in the end the audio is a very important component of it  
you have a mute remote controller  
yeah i've just been taking the the class files from your directory  
it's fun to touch  
okay  
okay  
ah  
okay  
uh so just uh last question maybe uh so this makes a x. m. l. file  
but your mobile phone is downstairs or something you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now  
plus the zoom plus maybe some rotation  
yeah i could take out the push buttons but we need those  
that's perfect  
press next  
no problem  
i don't know what what colours should the basic print be like  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
other than click click click  
sure  
far apart  
are we  
yeah touch screen yeah  
so titanium smell like fruit  
yes well  
does it take long to learn to use  
yeah  
so  
the the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables like primary colours spongy shape  
yeah  
um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do um and how it's going to do it hopefully  
hi i'm guillermo  
yeah  
yeah  
you can again get the you have got a complex <unk> <unk> frequency or complex spectrum you can get the phase right  
but  
uh too uh too many levels  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
oh  
just for environmental reasons  
is this enough  
yeah okay  
more or less  
there  
yeah  
this  
or  
yeah i think we should just imagine white buttons  
if um from this time to this time they're looking at triangle one  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
oh that's the batteries  
so then it starts here this time against speaker d. because in between there's somebody else  
yeah  
yeah  
and then once i've done that i can look at the whatever analysis we need to get done out of the g. d. f.  
oriented  
um  
yeah yeah  
said they zap a lot  
and what's that supposed to be  
i'll just uh saved in my documents  
yeah  
mm  
right  
okay  
and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room <unk> that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job  
well maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control  
but you still um  
yeah  
you mean we can change the colour uh of th  
and we wanna go for simplicity  
mm-hmm  
how can <unk> product evaluation doesn't that come after actually seen  
yeah  
that's especially aimed at this group even uh the young group will also be more interested  
and uh the answer is uh no  
i am  
i got this slide from the coach and i'm not sure what it's connected to  
yeah  
alright  
menu for the l. c. d. screen  
and when it you know when time goes by and they think well i'll never put him in the <unk>  
okay  
yeah six  
mm  
would it need a battery then  
yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well  
um  
well mm-hmm  
even then as well um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so i've used what i think's appropriate  
like a wheel on your mouse  
a and  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
yep  
yeah  
much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood  
yeah  
but i'm not the authority to say that it is  
per  
so you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom or your special colour at the bottom  
yep  
yeah i know  
uh without special or increased marketable features i don't believe the product has a consumer demand  
mm-hmm  
i'm i i go along with this because this is what we're given to try to market but i i don't see the market niche for this product  
uh-huh  
and more or less you can divide this into a hilbert envelope <unk> hilbert carrier  
i don't think so  
yep  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um  
okay okay  
we can see at a later stage maybe i don't  
it's whether it's a process or a a feature  
alright  
okay  
new ideas about uh the working of this software about about the project about the remote controls or  
and uh will drawing it on the <unk>  
yeah  
well actually some households do have three and four t. v. <unk> and they would have a remote for each one so  
yeah  
yeah  
it gives you basically something in the end which vaguely tells you just whether a word is a very specific word  
yeah  
i don't know i'm not feeling that i'm really working at the moment i'm more just trying to make sense of everything  
uh hopefully  
uh it's i most cats are small  
well <unk> i mean um we might want to um severely cash limit the investment that you put into making a part builder right  
<unk>  
but you have to fill in this column huh  
four yeah that  
i think  
yeah yeah yeah  
anyone got any thoughts  
yeah  
so th seven seven  
yeah i dunno  
another device is not a solution  
and the spaceship doesn't have the r. have a massive r. and r. down the side of it but i still want one  
we have an idea yeah  
hmm  
so we want it to be um a t. v. remote or i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote  
yeah  
i like how it fits in the hand though so i i'd go with a two  
mm  
uh okay  
uh how do you tell which one's better  
so so that's only to say that uh it's it can be really infinitive clustering  
there's no way you can integrate scroll wheels because it's all curved  
no i think i think actually it's a seven maybe but there's nothing innovative about it  
yeah  
uh and that's that will be our guide  
yeah  
i'm sure you could <unk> work it out to fit in the casing without causing too much difficulty  
that could be uh  
i've lost my screen  
it is a banana  
um so i will be uh sebastian the project manager  
in any way or shape or form  
right  
yeah <unk>  
i don't remember the name  
so  
keep it in mind  
two buttons and a joystick  
i think two or three  
mm  
we <unk> kind of wanted to stick with the  
with a keywords and yeah  
so a transmitter here  
just random <unk>  
i love excel it's one of my favourite programs  
<unk> the the main <unk> the main character  
with no <unk> uh  
and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then you know  
mm-hmm  
um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it  
and then i'll press the plus and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five  
come on  
and the materials it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but  
but still have the buttons so it's easy to use but only those key buttons the major buttons and then one sort of menu one  
yeah that would be my guess as well  
absorption features in the u. v. spectra  
um yeah  
um  
yeah  
probably not  
and the volume  
okay  
okay  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
'cause it's uh a big i think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control within the same room  
mm  
hey but uh i think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen  
it's meant to be easily wiped out yeah  
yes that that that that's mm  
and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power and then that would make that choice  
yeah  
um i personally think it has to be multi purpose  
i can have these things anyway yeah  
uh we need the real reaction logo and colour scheme obviously  
well that's complicated but is that so relevant  
it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t. v.  
okay  
oh so the summary is probably okay 'cause it does the job  
idea  
yeah when in doubt  
uh  
and that we have a shared network where we can put all of the  
so if so the main idea is like suppose you have uh one segment so he's trying to find the <unk> cautious <unk> of that segment  
<unk> we need really need to interest uh <unk> younger customers and then with younger customers i mean people uh below the age of forty  
not on the entire back but uh just very small  
okay right um what else do you need to talk about  
yes  
two times quick  
yeah or or ready made versions of them for that matter and  
yeah uh actually we  
so you will never get lost yeah  
i will draw a little turtle for you all  
or like information  
yeah  
it's at the bottom  
yeah  
i was thinking that here it says that you have online video structure correction  
so it's  
alright  
yeah  
different  
mm-hmm  
even if it was just like the title of it like the three presentations and i would do your three  
yeah  
yeah yeah it's really like you ought to get used to the system  
we'll have a base station extra uh on the side  
yeah i'd say for now um <unk> we don't even have uh much new stuff to be uh to be gone over for a first pass  
and also it's not too far from um a mobile  
mm  
are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and  
simple regular advanced and the price goes up as we choose each of this  
um and people lose them  
it's better than than my uh drawing  
but i think with the <unk> given time constraints it's probably easier instead of making a very efficient display code to just make the time make the clock whatever  
no  
whoops i forgot to put the thing on  
yeah  
yeah  
oh yes i mm i dunno mm i think six it's a good uh  
um so i guess now we just go to the project evaluation  
hmm  
yep  
in two cases  
um in speech it's uh stationary over ten twenty millisecond  
because when you think about it the alternative is to go push the button  
questions or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end  
no this not gonna sell  
but uh i heard like even for i. <unk> next year there is some com uh like computation by martin <unk> sheffield  
meet here um go ahead and take it away guys  
then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand  
it probably won't go the first time it'll probably be like a <unk> mess  
yeah  
well you can put that in uh into the shared folder and then i'll put it in our end report  
but  
ease of use is important but uh innovation is more important and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important  
for the <unk> and uh well to keep it <unk>  
with uh plastic casing  
okay  
yeah so it's cheap  
does anybody want to um  
and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future  
ah  
the other thing we were getting sorted out was the the microphones  
yeah  
yeah exactly  
yeah  
which is even not green there but uh uh grass  
and then you can buy from another company some such application <unk> you can dictate your s. m. s. or whatever  
i think they are are <unk> are contradicting each other because they want a simpler design  
cool  
yeah  
and that's it  
um this is my first uh go round with creating a remote control so i think we're all in the same boat here  
if the i if the young people are interested in l. c. d. screens we should make 'em  
okay so  
mm-hmm  
but wasn't there one just a minute ago in which only had a line  
simple rechargeable uh batteries  
no  
i wasn't really given any options i was just given that this is how they're done  
so uh pet peter can you talk say something about that  
during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a  
that's uh  
we <unk> mostly have twos so it's pretty good  
yeah i it's not every year right  
mm-hmm  
yeah that would be handy  
yeah  
yeah  
no that's quite inter quite attractive  
they are applying p. l. p. with some <unk> with this this one approach  
because  
it can't work  
and then the remaining moves um will uh contribute to either the um the meeting of that discourse goal or the decision not to bother with that discourse goal  
or if  
mm-hmm  
remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy  
so we can <unk> on this point also like  
yeah but if you <unk> say them up and down they they'll understand it i think  
or uh you can just give some nickname to your remote control like bobby  
here we go  
or no  
yeah  
no i don't  
next  
tape free smart meeting room  
or to be honest like it's much quicker for me to get stuff done on my own  
without making something too complex and too long to develop  
to switch from buttons to interface hmm  
um hold on  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
it's gonna jiggle all over the place  
energy question mark  
mm  
<unk> i don't think so  
so what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design  
i'll put it back in a minute  
mm  
handy  
yeah  
ooh it works  
no no we are not making a universal remote we are just looking at uh giving a scenario  
the difference between the  
i think the best thing to do is to have a machine just which is only dedicated to to that  
okay  
i i think i like the the colour a the colour are very good so actually so  
well yeah a colour of a wood style a white <unk> and uh a couple of <unk> hip uh fruity colours  
so  
but now i have one file also in the so you can process again one time  
i think that's very difficult because of different shapes of uh uh devices  
okay  
that's that's much easier  
programme  
because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons  
mm-hmm  
i know i'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right  
'kay  
because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much  
we put <unk> an an extra button in  
i think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in  
not necessary  
and then it will say hi  
mm  
yeah yeah  
okay  
fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it  
so of course we could try to make scene clustering and so on but i'm not even sure that this is necessary for them at this point  
yeah but when the power gets low you have to shake it or something  
what are you going to do  
mm  
i'm not sure if it's impossible but uh there's a chance it's not so  
no it's wrong  
or or was it gonna make a noise  
okay that's cool  
but when the <unk> not yeah  
it should have been two questions  
yep  
now we uh just connect uh the t. v. type uh to a set of options in just just in the memory  
you could we could maybe do that instead  
yeah with the two parts was uh original so  
yeah i know  
thanks  
and he did  
okay  
yeah but since we have the l. c. d. we didn't need too much button too many buttons  
and a light uh  
nice work  
'cause i think it should be quite easy  
mm  
mm-hmm <unk>  
uh yeah  
yeah  
mm  
i think it's not necessarily a bad idea actually  
one also  
yeah  
um  
okay  
that was what we'd we'd mentioned  
so um like  
these are two leading um remote controls at the moment  
they are uh cheaper  
th this is  
um  
which is quite a number  
that's for you  
thanks guys  
yes  
basically what i was thinking was um just sending them your call for papers and <unk> changing it slightly to say dear philosophy students  
no uh let's say i'll put two  
so our yes rather than the number of penalties or or something  
so  
yeah you can  
yeah very good yeah  
to draw i guess  
well they are now  
yeah  
or maybe it can respond and produce sound so say where it is  
<unk> right  
mm don't think so  
yeah  
what  
right right right <unk> right  
mm yeah  
and how do you know  
yeah  
that's right  
decision  
is that right  
thank you  
so the idea we we will have plenty of rooms uh like in libraries or meeting rooms where student will arrive and work  
but it has to be a little bit heavier  
and uh the technical aspects um and also <unk> of the buttons the functions should be universal standards  
yeah  
uh nah  
just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there and that we do have to fit the stuff in there  
and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around be a little bit more prepared  
oh  
so maybe it's more useful to <unk> <unk> to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because  
yeah i i mean th th this needs going <unk> into the technology a bit  
no  
and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not  
oh did you  
um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices  
okay  
<unk> bo both predators  
no i think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some  
you can find most functions on a t. v. set  
exactly like an ipod  
um also we could use um an alarm  
which one do <unk>  
yeah  
i don't think we should yeah for exam  
yeah there's only in in this dimension  
yeah  
yeah  
important to mm  
um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation  
okay  
okay i <unk> thought maybe it's either be here or because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter i'm not sure  
then the processor has to uh make up a different morse code when some button is pressed  
and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control  
evaluation  
yeah  
saved  
um the thing is it i don't know  
so  
um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti r. s. i. um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it  
ye  
yes maybe a bit of a cushion is  
okay  
mm-hmm  
'kay my favourite animal uh let's see  
mm-hmm  
so we could get it down to what  
fifteen  
very good  
um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public because that's our public  
eh  
in our own case we want to have uh a table that would be accessible by by students  
um  
i mean you need to say it now  
mm mm  
and we com and we <unk> and we convert file directly to <unk>  
or but i don't <unk> i don't really have an idea like what other words what we would do today in this meeting  
limit the number of buttons user friendly  
so i think <unk> the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required  
if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what i mean  
so but but continue with your uh mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah you see like here  
<unk> oh  
okay  
uh go ahead  
well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though that's yellow and grey  
so you can  
mm  
yeah okay  
five  
mute  
<unk> <unk> you're a power voter uh veto anyway as project manager  
uh yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh  
yeah  
it should be it should have round edge so uh then it's easier  
maybe we've so suggested this two part thing  
that's what i mean  
okay i i have a point about l. c. d. i dunno if it is the right point to take it up  
hello  
is there  
but what what can we do  
but if i need to generate new results then and anyway there is emotional loss so scripts and code everything written that is  
yeah wood  
they're having a lunch break at the moment but yeah  
i think so yeah  
and and you know <unk> uh when you install another device  
an and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that  
okay  
because it's completely subjective  
yeah  
uh right  
yeah  
surely  
uh i don't know the name <unk> <unk> in english uh  
okay  
yeah th no it's the it's the pineapple control remote control  
a little later but here it is  
oh alright  
yeah mm  
yep  
import export  
yeah yes  
you can use it now by switching all these buttons  
and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you <unk> go you press that and go through the menus  
yeah i think that will do  
per  
yeah it's a bird but what kind of bird  
is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside and it's just covered with the latex  
oh no it's it's okay  
um yes  
yeah  
that <unk> that was my reflex at the time to put that there  
mm  
so for the dictionary is it okay if i do whatever word blank frequency or something  
yeah  
and to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new <unk> that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now  
oh  
yep  
yep  
right  
exactly  
do you want me to put a search in soon  
ah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um  
i dunno  
okay  
yeah  
you can put it next to you and then dive it in and  
true  
living up in <unk>  
so um due to your hard work we might as well let the uh two designers go first and uh show us the prototype  
well i i heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that  
design  
but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station  
uh our current customers are within the age group of forty plus  
no  
anyway the display has something useful for that  
yep  
like is it are you <unk> are you all working on the same meeting  
to uh go uh reasonably well  
'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that we should install a small backup battery  
uh  
fine yes uh  
yeah  
there  
yeah  
hmm  
oh you've got the <unk>  
yeah  
adding them up  
i can put the other buttons in  
which is did not explained what i what it was but i'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker  
nope  
okay  
six point five yeah  
the th  
<unk> a  
well what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit  
yeah  
are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period  
we should only make a remote control nothing more  
okay  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so the working design i've got a very quick presentation on this so um i've oh no you can't see a thing  
it was good  
no  
uh and and  
yeah  
if if your intention is to move the red triangle to sit on top of the thing already constructed you would tend to look back and forth  
yeah and so that's where the difficulties lie  
avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button like you have on a mouse  
yeah i guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh  
and that's very peculiar about them  
but that's probably uh  
special colour  
yeah  
and the abstract doesn't have to be much it's probably only half a side of a. four or something isn't it  
like this  
we'll come to that later i <unk> i think  
<unk> wednesday we are meeting and looking at their at their implementation in some more detail to actually understand what's going on  
so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle  
compiled off line by a summary module  
yeah yeah  
because that is not marked in the  
which is like exactly the mirror image of this one  
yeah  
i mean it's it's unfortunate  
alright now here's the sixty million dollar question well twenty five twenty five euro question  
oh that makes sense  
no  
i was think i mean maybe the end of  
well <unk> he wasn't paid in advance  
with the printed circuit boards you were going for the  
no it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um <unk> we call it fruity if you will  
so  
and <unk> even uh testing with only the slides uh to capture all the uh like what you were saying the the <unk> uh the video <unk> uh stream  
um should i erase this or  
edinburgh c. s. t. r. yeah  
i guess you can  
um <unk> maybe show us the general sort of outline  
it is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive  
five  
um next please  
less button  
'kay we're going to um  
or not a remo i'm sorry a microphone by the t. v. speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote  
which we weren't asking them to do but anyway they did it  
well  
uh not very high tech uh indeed and it's not very user friendly  
so  
oh no we're back to it again  
or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up it's also nice  
but  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so no no uh microphone arrays or anything like that  
no  
yeah  
add th that that's an opportunity  
mm-hmm  
but what about the lighting up effect  
mm  
sounds uh  
okay  
<unk> <unk> pas  
oh of course yeah the user requirement specifications uh-huh yeah  
mm-hmm  
like uh join a meeting late and <unk> um catch up on what's happened in the meeting so far be at home waiting for the washing repair guy  
right but why do why to do it for speech recognition  
it's  
yeah  
like a chameleon  
in the right order  
yes  
yeah  
but we can extend it  
yeah  
no but i guess i mean if you just if you trust in dave's summary for the audio  
the actual computational mechanisms they have currently for building up the trees can't  
basic premise of a remote control  
and um your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen  
mm  
hey what if you do like hyperlink  
it's just the  
i will do something like that  
yeah  
that uh disk which has not crashed it can be recovered completely  
i think so  
okay so then we forget the ball  
um last one we've got is room for creativity  
i  
mm-hmm  
seen on regular mobile phones  
okay that's fine  
mm-hmm  
that was a big thing here  
oh <unk>  
in a lot other ways too  
chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a  
have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down so there's kind of um everything else revealed  
we want to have a no i don't know if this is a good idea  
he's been looking at the data okay <unk> to good  
in the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions  
yeah  
so it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go  
yeah  
you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up  
we may be talking quite heavy then  
i think so yeah  
we oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype  
do we  
uh uh ye uh yeah  
it's a great idea  
so now  
but it's cost effective  
yeah  
so  
mm okay  
i will work this out uh for the uh next meeting  
i shouldn't you're right there  
be simple  
i think that top is the best option  
mm  
um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme  
that's why  
awesome  
i think it's perfect the <unk> where it is what it can do if it useful  
same goes for you  
'kay  
um i mean you know some <unk> rainy day you might wanna think about  
yeah yeah  
okay  
microphone array  
two three  
mm  
maybe lights also around the volume and the <unk> the plus minus programme buttons  
yeah  
or the double curved  
mm <unk>  
mm-hmm  
simple but  
missed that one  
no you you can have a switch menu so you can  
mm  
yeah  
yeah right  
uh-huh  
yeah  
which was quite some typing  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but they uh assume basically uh that they have this document  
yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow we have  
no  
and it's also not i don't th even think it it looks <unk> like sexy or something it's  
uh these are stripes  
yeah  
so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing  
oh right  
um it's actually a coyote  
yeah  
yeah the the television can tell you  
oh so that was it on dialogue okay  
um that's basically it's it's <unk> going on about this fancy called geometric mean which effectively just means multiplying them  
yeah  
it it says uh the things that you type in or something like that so  
mm yeah  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well i think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function  
so i asked other questions but uh it's quite tough yeah  
yeah  
and this is quite <unk> simple  
so they're more widely available now  
because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by t. v. programs you have to decide a category of <unk> for them  
alright that did nothing  
yeah  
then that's fine  
seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and  
yeah  
sure sure  
yeah  
let's go th for i think it would be a <unk> yeah two  
exactly  
it seems to just take the first utterances more or less  
so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours  
you won't draw them or  
my documents that's not what i want  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah sorry i couldn't get that <unk> to use before  
yeah  
really  
it should shouldn't be  
is is everyone um  
mm  
right right  
yeah  
but the look and feel  
okay so probably just  
okay  
uh-huh  
yeah  
um but nate <unk> tried to um you know define  
um therefore  
yeah it was the same the same ones as the one you saw uh in my code yeah  
it's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing  
dave i think actually that the summary at the current moment isn't working a hundred percent correct  
i think  
we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price  
ah some eye  
we go and look at nite x. m. l. or some of us look at nite x. m. l. in a bit more detail  
yeah we can get them  
you can make some animals  
okay  
if you take the laughter out and then calculate it  
or you just make uh one colour uh maybe with a a <unk> a kind of like a big wave or something like uh  
if if you you you can if you want you can use th the  
so you have a a nice pen and it's works just like a <unk> ball pen  
i mixed up the colours a little bit  
yeah  
is this 'cause this is the  
mm  
uh-huh  
'cause it seems that rainbow does in its structure quite rely on having different examples of the same category sort of in in a way  
i don't think you were  
which is um well how would you decide whether something was the current addendum uh the <unk>  
oh so that's interesting  
yes  
and i've done blue wings of this and this and this  
it's more more just that we we think about like  
to have it flashy to have it it's for young people  
yeah  
the frame  
and so i'll i. s. who already have at least two  
so how were did the project process uh go  
uh  
you you can't send that to anyone because you you've <unk> something on a page for yourself and then you're going to send it yeah  
the the channels are different on each <unk> television they aren't set in a preset order  
sure  
people sitting and uh it's a <unk> it's a lecture uh a meeting collection  
inter internally it can do that kind of thing but if the th if the three disks fail  
okay  
okay  
it's just a normal <unk> marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual <unk>  
um so um  
first the functional design  
so that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment  
exactly  
hello  
not really  
of course  
that's right  
and i think that our <unk> remote control should not look like uh any other  
that yeah that was uh that was just about all  
so maybe maybe <unk> we can we should stick to general feeling  
uh so so 'cause i'm i might not familiar with these <unk>  
was good to yeah  
mm  
yeah  
no  
oh sorry  
mm  
no  
well the there has to be some pointing at  
yeah that would <unk>  
special colour  
no  
no it's <unk>  
okay perfect  
yeah three quarters  
well if it's something in the audio that's just like a noise then we don't want it  
yeah oh yeah  
well i'm guess i'm done  
one till uh uh zero till nine  
<unk> yeah that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much  
i know  
take me to your leader  
if you don't want <unk> if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch t. v. now  
yeah  
mm  
what what we didn't talk about is um uh  
so one is the place of the lounge  
maybe if if it's possible yeah  
uh in this presentation i'm going to see how we could <unk> utterance to utterance relations in multi party meetings  
yeah but not too detailed  
will be <unk> as expensive as the l. c. d. buttons so  
uh oh  
okay so i mean so that means that there's probably even if you go on an per utterance level  
yeah  
and the materials  
mm-hmm  
then uh it's <unk> it's yours to do a french and dutch and english and  
yeah  
i have a question uh for you  
this is very quick uh design uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that  
um so just for record i i will take uh notes again  
a different shape or okay not the example i would choose  
sometimes you get like an uh and it <unk> you're not sure if it's an an a. yeah or an <unk> it yeah  
du  
um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay  
um i suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress  
i don't know even much about giraffes but i just love the way they look  
okay  
i'm sure that uh it don't like but uh i don't see just one button  
well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use  
to <unk> it and so i mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something you know different  
it will come uh  
mm  
that's about it didn't get anything else  
mm-hmm  
you have an additional processor and and software part  
but you don't have to buy batteries  
and also uh the main idea today why i told maybe is like if you can list down what all things are there to be taken care of  
makes sense  
i really didn't knew that  
it'll have brightness contrast anything else  
like group all the initial ones into one scene and maybe after when there's some things inside it <unk> should be another scene so  
special colours yeah  
oh yeah we have to talk in english huh  
no but it's it's not i think at least it takes two hours or three hours i think  
yeah  
mm yes  
seven eight  
oh sorry  
oh  
and point at  
uh f. five  
okay are are there any new ideas about this  
mm-hmm  
yeah even dolphin in the yeah  
it was not not spongy feel  
we have a battery  
yeah  
ow  
yeah  
yeah  
so uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar  
<unk> <unk> yeah a good point uh about password protection issues uh or the privacy issues uh  
would be mm would be nice for aurora maybe to have that  
uh well if we um include other uh innovative  
is that how most people feel about that  
yeah  
yeah you cannot play with that  
mm  
previous previous okay  
it's fairly expensive to use these circuits  
well you might need the meeting action segmentation in order to know where what uh what area you're circumventing for so  
uh got a single curved uh rubber  
because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important  
thanks  
with a back up battery  
t. v. gamma ray emission  
yeah  
for  
so it could be curve so it could be convex <unk> concave depending on what what we want  
i've been here for almost two years and we've had a couple of <unk> but that's it  
okay  
i don't see it  
maybe a it'd be <unk> <unk> <unk>  
um  
other than the fact that they keep dying uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance  
yes  
so yeah we may as well collaborate  
mm  
the want to pay for oh  
the sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway  
yeah  
oh  
so it doesn't really look like a dolphin but then again this is all new for me  
um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out  
yeah pretty much  
yeah  
and uh from from talking to mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now  
uh with um to insert the time code on each frame  
uh yeah  
'cause now i see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it  
that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology  
um hmm <unk> that would be a consideration to take into account yes  
mm  
yeah i understand  
we discussed  
'cause before we have that  
should it be one  
thanks  
mm-hmm  
and you have the pretty little shell going on  
which kind of controller would you prefer to use you as a remote control user  
so for my part i will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use where to use and <unk> uh and so on  
no  
okay  
okay  
it's like some sort of uh teletext option but we don't have teletext  
yeah and i think like i'll just i'll just kick in full time for n. l. s. s. d. next week 'cause there's nothing i have to do then  
yeah  
uh and then we have to uh agree on the rating together  
and then you have the option of having the different colours different covers  
so so that's the reason  
mm-hmm  
and then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple  
and we have some slaves machine here  
yeah  
mm 'kay  
even for deaf people yeah  
why  
no wood but plastic  
i personally think that that becomes too much  
okay  
a different extension of a  
while still keeping to the company's image basically  
the then we have that as well but <unk> with a similar  
oh does it have smart materials by the way  
so yeah that looks like to be the only thing  
and uh uh that's with the components we will use we will have different uh messages different sequences  
'cause all we all know that our resources are being limited and we have to be very environmentally conscious  
but  
is that what it is  
so that's that for now  
i would say thirty five to forty  
that's what um <unk> file has got  
i th i th i think this is too time consuming  
so it'd constantly be charged so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you  
i i wanna make this thing something that i can identify as special in some way so maybe we can have some i i talked about environmentally sensitive  
this is related to your um m. l. m. i.  
right  
mm-hmm  
oh but you have a catch there  
okay  
yeah mine is seven  
okay cool  
yeah because if you have them close together there's always some fuzz factor around them  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
totally  
you have uh basically uh the energy the power of the of the remote control uh and the sender  
yeah think so  
then you flip it open but it's it it's more time consuming  
complicated <unk> complicating things even <unk> mm  
but it still means one thing which is a mystery to me <unk> why temp one and temp two were residing on the same hard disk physical  
go on  
ah  
we will send we want to  
so  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
of course because it's my design but no our <unk> our design alright  
sometimes unreadable i would say  
<unk> rahman  
if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know  
that kinda would <unk> <unk> yeah  
hmm  
okay  
dunno  
yeah  
oh  
yeah rub off some of those  
no single curve  
right  
mm-hmm  
well  
so the next meeting will start in thirty <unk> minutes so we'll you will all have to work in  
alright  
any questions everyone know what they're doing  
um  
yeah right  
no but i think just one fruit to control everything  
you know so this is  
mm-hmm  
have ourselves sponsored  
so we can is it fine  
okay  
we just report that it has to be over budget or the colours you could take away <unk> colours for th for the buttons  
one and  
f. eight  
yeah  
<unk> is this a day  
okay  
they do it  
right  
yeah  
huh  
the fruit and <unk>  
so  
hmm  
no but you can't you can't <unk> also point to <unk> increasing blue wing  
hmm  
that's what we said  
yeah  
mm  
yes  
so  
you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product  
oh yeah of course yeah  
that could be a sales pitch  
hmm  
yeah this is something we <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
yeah but  
um what we need to discuss now is the finance of it um i got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so special colours  
yeah  
it's not like in paint  
yeah  
well  
have fun lads  
mm  
well <unk> i'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a d. v. d. and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this  
mm  
great  
like across the whole corpus  
so basically you want to do the segmentation because you're going to apply completely different analyses to the two sections  
so this word will be not very informative across the categories  
okay  
we well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
this  
but th  
okay  
if we use the batteries and the additional so solar cell  
everything i have is kinda background  
yeah  
yeah yeah sure  
so that could that's a bit confusing  
yeah  
okay  
so here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah l. a. l. a. l. e. d.  
mm-hmm  
well be for the l. c. d. uh you had said  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay  
um <unk>  
okay  
then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it yeah yeah  
so i'm <unk> not sure if i got it  
because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c. d. player  
i don't know <unk> which one it would display then  
interesting  
but uh <unk> yeah  
mm that's oh that's oh i like it  
yes  
i i think it should uh should work it <unk> we should manage that  
the other one i had problems converting uh uh the video into d. v. x.  
though i think that's what people would pay for i mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote you're gonna expect it to do something  
mm-hmm  
new prints on it  
mm-hmm  
okay um as for the case kind of discussed that  
uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance this is just uh an example  
the time to market  
it's kinda weird  
or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or so <unk> better if you have all this in the same  
we turn that into a message um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver  
okay  
well mm-hmm  
but on average you know linguistic research shows that on average the people use five hundred words  
okay  
right  
'cause that'd be really useful is if we had a big directory  
so i  
okay so my name is <unk>  
five  
oh i i it  
mm-hmm  
the n. should be  
but we since we are concentrating on uh  
so the engineering <unk> ones uh provide a lot of functionality  
yeah  
as long as everything's in the right order it shouldn't like we should even be able to just i. d. it when we're reading it in  
no i mean in a  
but it's not regular i mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and i got it in ninety four but still  
because you were aiming at something in um the g. d. f. format and i wasn't quite sure what  
uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end  
and buttons are not <unk>  
and and b. um okay  
nah  
okay  
well then uh the serious uh stuff  
but i mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative <unk> technology anyway i think  
could we go in fruit and vegetable colours  
kate  
yes chief  
yeah  
is there all is that <unk> version all in the  
i mean not in the final version just for now  
so this is the the key point  
alright thank you  
alt function f. eight  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no that's false  
yeah  
alright  
but this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away um  
should try to decide which shape the thing is  
i i mean i think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there  
um speech recognition in a remote control  
oh so you have a  
yeah that's true  
uh energy we choose regular regular batteries  
nah the material isn't that  
okay  
yeah definitely definitely  
weak emission levels is just a way of saying yeah i agree  
i mean i guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard <unk> button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff  
oh yeah i <unk> i did that yeah  
uh i think it's slicker to have no l. <unk>  
you do  
mm-hmm  
where do you find that  
that's what i was trying to work out  
sorry  
what tomato  
yeah  
so might be ninety <unk> for the the remaining things which the cord and everything <unk> go  
yeah  
i have to know what it has to do  
well <unk> uh <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
so um  
yeah  
sorry this is all tangled up here  
okay  
then just say so and if you want to do a poster then say you want to do a poster  
oh we've discussed how <unk> high it is but how wide is it  
or even i mean you could even just have it left on  
it's good to have them together so we don't have to keep changing it  
oh  
is it is  
yeah but this is um species of cloud it's a <unk>  
so to come back to the problem we had before  
yeah  
yeah  
it's <unk>  
um fifty percent i think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons  
this one is talking for x. time or uh has been talking uh x. percent of the five last minutes  
so we can say one or two  
<unk> except for the for the special shape the surfing board it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh  
not too strange  
uh okay  
actually i mean these first two points we've already sort of gone away from  
and i'll yeah i'll make a script to run it and put that in the group directory  
yeah okay okay  
<unk> uh just a point to the energy th things  
yeah uh just if this is there's more of it uh yeah i yes  
i mean i <unk> i would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white  
yes  
true true  
so if i say hi mike and you have recorded uh hi mike back then you will get that  
well see you soon  
um  
or edit  
for example put electronic card on a spongy thing i can i can imagine it could be a problem  
i believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um  
the first question  
um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery  
um this is just off the top of my head keep in mind  
yeah  
the uh energy source for one thing can be altered  
yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow doesn't make it freaky  
and the user can just like set it in between wherever they want the uh without actually telling them what it actually means if you see what i mean  
that is to say uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay  
so now we  
if i get the uh spreadsheet up  
which we have to fill in later on  
um do you have trouble whistling  
okay everyone well done  
incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow in the dark material  
um what i've done with it i'm sorry  
hmm  
and what you have on a sort of segment but not quite segment base  
mm-hmm yeah  
maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop  
over to you  
okay  
then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs  
yeah but this is good because it's not a long long life product  
it's not quite it's <unk> two or three minutes to  
mm-hmm  
i've never done it before  
those new only right  
so i'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up  
well  
okay  
frame  
okay  
yeah  
but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just <unk> silver and black  
well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there  
it doesn't count  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
so maybe we should think about uh wood finish  
for the non removable uh part  
and we can also market it as i 'cause we were <unk> saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the r. people were getting the complaining about r. s. i.  
mm-hmm  
give me more  
mm  
yeah  
but you should uh think about the things like uh <unk>  
yeah you are going to design it so  
for example that you have a very um top level um summary and a separate file for for each level  
okay  
of course if we have some you know some constraints given by the electronic i mean it's that's better  
okay  
okay  
sure  
radio loud quasar again  
so we actually worked well as a group  
yeah not really  
so uh if that's <unk> uh if that's the problem you also have to find it easily  
i mean it's i or in such a new idea  
exactly  
and rubber uh kind of softens the fall  
and we had a special colour  
yeah meeting will close in five minutes  
okay  
so you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea i'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly  
yeah  
bright  
<unk> start with the casing  
okay  
no  
hmm  
i think so  
so  
yeah indeed  
yeah maybe we can first come to  
i is it has to be cooler than easy to use you know if it has the newest features  
okay yeah so next slide  
you still have a  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
we've got trend watching that's you  
they more want these fancy features like  
because you're making counts for word forms right  
mm-hmm  
um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice which are  
yeah i think if we work together on an on an entropy based score  
that's a good word for it  
well teletext goes out  
you should put that uh power button channel and volume should have the most uh importance  
okay l. c. d. yeah  
okay well let's go back to the  
so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went  
mm-hmm  
so you won't find me anytime after that  
otherwise you would have a simple chip just for pressing buttons  
similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty euros depending on uh branding  
it's it's much more younger  
um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick so  
yeah  
it's fun  
isn't it  
means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits  
teletext at your fingers without having to access that through the television  
mm  
battery yes  
at the moment there's just a booking system  
double curved yeah right  
uh  
you get idea right  
mm-hmm  
this uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um  
okay sorry then i've done it wrong so far  
i don't like yellow and uh maybe i don't know  
levels the new word  
or it could  
may fail though every here and there  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah in in the nite x. m. l. x. m. l. format so with their time stamps and stuff so that it's easy to to tie together <unk> things  
yeah  
very happy  
looks kind of yeah  
this is just uh an application which i  
yeah  
'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products right  
yeah so <unk> i mean to the different direction now that's what i mean to say  
i don't know  
no they will record through that  
yeah  
but anything is gonna have buttons  
yeah  
we already discussed  
and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work  
<unk> there's there's actually quite a bit more in there than than i heard before  
mm  
costs are okay  
but if it  
i dunno  
the way it walks or whatever  
yeah that that's  
it does leave them with an obligation to especially if they want to use it uh uh <unk> uh specifically as um voice activated  
which colour the the colour of the phone or the colour of the  
one thing about uh <unk> <unk>  
what is this <unk>  
i'm doing the interface  
yes  
it's called black  
well noisy yes  
so um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we <unk> the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost  
no no <unk>  
that probably makes it a lot easier then but it's sort of it's a boot strapping problem like for the prototype we need some type of data  
we could have a complex one or a a non complex  
mm  
and l. e. d. uh on it  
right that the verbal analysis and the um and the visual analysis give you the same breaking points the same <unk> points  
yeah  
okay  
then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue  
mm  
um  
where do you think you can uh produce something like that  
right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button  
i uh got some information from fashion watchers from paris and uh milan  
but um  
okay  
if you cover it with rubber  
<unk> <unk> <unk> evaluation <unk> sorry  
uh uh soft and fluffy and <unk> and well uh shapes are curved and round  
so you have something like  
yeah  
yeah  
it's it's <unk> right  
she has the small legs  
so well <unk> unless unless it's a bug report yeah  
oh then i miscalculated  
and also the use of a basis station for battery <unk> charging and uh also to um call the to call the <unk> mote remote control when it is lost  
yeah <unk> do <unk>  
mm  
i was th so what'd they have to do back up  
mm-hmm  
and also the speaker role  
oh <unk> uh unidentified remote control so  
you  
on <unk> on teletext yes  
yeah  
we can't lose the double curve  
yeah  
kind of a relevance clause  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that's right  
um pen yeah  
well does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused  
so we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals  
and it could  
in the project  
the question is are emission line objects a separate class of source  
yeah so so <unk> so like if even if we make one single text file which has the whole corpus  
um  
then you have to explain why that is  
curved  
yeah we have to keep yeah  
yeah yes  
mm  
no no no  
small logo with the like a small yellow strip or <unk> yellow with the logo in it  
it's locked for editing  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
add things to and take things away and don't see exactly what's going on at the time  
i've opened it already  
uh don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary  
if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself you know  
<unk> put it over here  
yeah  
yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards but if you have some more notes on that  
yeah  
or at least um simple versions of them  
mm-hmm  
um i mean it's the thing about posters unless you kind of say you know  
mm-hmm  
or shall we just put it on the pistol thing  
exactly  
yeah  
and i want to do that  
um <unk> forty six to forty five thirty three percent and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent  
but i think the pen is <unk> is very intuitive everybody knows how to use it we don't have to worry  
it's so <unk>  
whatever t. x. t. right files  
so i see you in thirty minutes  
yeah  
okay  
that's the spin wheel though isn't it  
seven  
hmm  
mm  
hopefully that's us ready to uh to go  
hmm  
and we make a stationary assumption a local stationary t. assumption um which allows you to use f. f. t. and blah blah blah  
so there are no results there  
i mean i think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know  
uh if we look at this data how how uh <unk> how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market  
it's alright  
but if you don't put it back in you press something like a little button on that  
yep  
wonder if it would have  
okay  
okay there you go  
so we should be careful  
it's an instrument yeah  
so does anyone have any comments or ideas on that  
okay so i have bit of a spreadsheet here for this  
yeah  
i read uh i read it on the i didn't know what company we were but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff  
uh  
or english  
maybe voice activation won't be good  
but will we <unk> actually we'll need two won't we  
uh i hope to be loyal to the project and not to <unk> not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something  
yeah there's r. and r. in front  
instead of a battery  
yeah  
that's um the interface between having the topic segments and calculating the uh information importance of words  
okay  
okay  
interchangeable thing  
the functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly  
in the  
i mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion you can just increase or decrease  
so we can with melissa and we'll just send out an email  
maybe a first so solution will be just to start <unk> with  
um that's why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch like an automatic watch  
we've been quite successful with the rubber coating and  
that's better  
um  
'cause there are three things  
yeah  
i'd  
so i mean does this need to go up a bit or something 'cause we've got both the  
yeah it should be  
so uh my yeah also also in you know countries where there's <unk> isn't much light like in scandinavia  
mm mm  
i mean it's usually quite small or when you want it right it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table  
finding them is really a pain you know  
yeah  
yeah  
um uh  
agreement and one disagreement  
yeah  
alright let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here  
okay  
half an hour or some  
oh  
it's <unk> terrible  
yeah you you can use um  
thank you  
yeah  
right  
to the hilbert envelope you mean no  
i think so  
or we could make oh  
so when you buy your remote you can buy  
if do you mean the the link between the well if the button was actually on  
you know so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both so i think we need to aim for both  
exactly use both  
or not present but bring to the meeting  
so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition  
and basically that's that's uh and again the outline is typical maybe in scientific presentation  
it 'cause it's <unk>  
we didn't really discuss it but  
okay  
yeah  
could we could take out the curve  
yeah i reckon you can just mean it over the sentence  
mm-hmm  
yeah group data speaker data or something  
oh that's true  
so i think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard  
you do  
oh yeah  
<unk>  
'kay  
yeah  
as much as yours  
what's the  
just checking that the they're of a suitable level of complexity or or of whatever  
uh um  
but uh you wouldn't be able to point something in a spectrum and say that's a damped lyman alpha absorber unless you'd  
look this one here  
either way is fine by me as long as the two <unk> things um tie up  
yeah okay  
kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something  
if i mean that was the the directive that came through from management  
it's it's a bit big  
yeah  
no it's not visible  
mm-hmm  
yeah but  
fifteen  
let's let's imagine a typical construction event okay  
yeah  
well do you want colour differentiation here  
yeah but then <unk>  
did we decide anything about um the other functions  
and you could also touch it so that it comes out and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers  
you mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels and we'll have the channel changer and volume and power  
okay  
for sure  
it's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel  
so there should still be well not that on  
yeah  
okay  
i think th it's  
uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which i suppose is quite similar  
so we'll say we'll say uh false  
why is that  
okay  
ami meeting  
okay  
yeah  
and it's more fun  
the rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity  
so we just have them right out on top um very just very sort of self explanatory  
the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set  
yeah yeah  
you don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote  
yeah  
yeah but not for each button one led i think  
mm that's a good idea actually i like the programmable options  
who is gonna do a <unk> presentation  
or just adapt like their like just sort of go from their system and and adapt that piece for piece and see how we could  
oh yeah it's just a <unk> uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist  
uh sorry uh can you go back for a second  
drinks are on the company  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so it cleans it up  
okay um new ideas found  
yeah among the old people yeah  
if we think it's useful we do it  
okay  
so and in which which which kind will be the the different <unk> button so it can be some you know  
and probably we not a native english speaker we use even less  
anyone else have anything more to say before we close  
i'll put both deadlines and i think i'll say that when you send in your abstract  
yeah complicated but  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
uh  
yeah  
so to me to market this a <unk> only a television remote control we have to change consciousness  
yeah  
uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours  
it's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television so i it's basically a communication device  
uh we well we use the same file during uh the whole day  
yeah  
uh  
and i'll just i i'll just kinda market it as an linguistics and english language or something like that i think  
mm mm mm mm mm  
but it also a tool for us as a researcher to test uh both the interaction event we want to detect and to test the <unk>  
uh they're not uh  
and uh what will people say  
hmm  
happy  
hmm  
right  
where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before  
my suggestion therefore is to re examine the idea of poster session altogether and find a better way to implement it if there seems to be enough interest in it  
if that's true then their leaving out the word line i don't should mean that it shouldn't be marked  
i  
mm  
no  
so but what did the marketing  
so are  
we could lose the scroll wheel  
charging  
no  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
let's have a break  
furthermore it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot  
um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device  
he or she  
yep  
uh <unk>  
okay  
might be yeah  
um technological technological innovations that's uh regarded very highly too  
'kay did you save your presentation  
you see the second mail  
so maybe uh that's i i think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions  
but there will be some additional buttons i guess  
no no  
yeah  
another thing that you were saying about <unk> the controls  
so  
that's fine  
or it's a short one  
okay  
or are you gonna be on holiday  
don't you think so  
right  
we ran out of resources here so  
<unk> which is develop by <unk> and <unk>  
i don't remember what we were gonna do about things that weren't there  
no okay maybe not  
j. and j. okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that's people they actually do it themselves  
hmm  
yeah  
but i guess we have to look at <unk> what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway  
so  
when we want to include i i i'm doubting about this this component  
especially the volume buttons the channel <unk> buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels  
the train on the website and i dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people  
cool  
i'm sorry i skipped it  
the others looked like garbage couldn't tell what they might have been  
ease of use  
okay  
so  
to make it kind of futuristic  
well i'm not so you think displaying uh like an information about similarity to the select uh like to a selected meeting in to a selected segment in the other segments  
yeah  
mm  
means if both the disk have crashed for the same data you cannot recover anything  
ah we have one  
exactly  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so curvy or not  
so it is basically the concept we discussed before  
that's a huge amount  
no  
mm 'kay  
i guess  
but  
yep  
yeah yeah  
yeah yeah  
seriously  
mm yeah  
so you <unk> m. l. p. needs to be trained and uh p. l. p. features  
i dunno i mean  
um there's a energy source here  
yeah  
yeah you're right  
but you can't you can't use <unk> all the time twenty four hours a day  
i remember you saying this before  
but as the um expert told us most of the people want to use the remote control to zap <unk> to zap between channels  
yeah  
they can make  
yeah  
yes so does anyone have a good idea where to start like which what so what is it we talk about getting in at the moment  
uh-huh  
so what about the figure things  
as it's yeah  
no it could well be i've probably missed that  
he's he's doing you most of the things  
um i'm mandy and i'm the project manager  
yeah  
and is the the other main group then um philosophy  
uh  
with more  
wow  
um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l. c. d.  
to fit in with our areas of expertise  
true  
let's all let's all go for the yellow  
so we used two basic colour yellow and red  
manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um  
well the first point is the remote control matches the operating <unk> of the young user  
yeah i'll see if i understand how to <unk>  
yeah so  
the battery it is under  
um <unk> uh <unk> ye well i don't know  
so you need to do that uh adequately yeah  
well we're selling so many units of this  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news  
'cause i need to make sure i'm sending them the right form  
but i i think we can we can cut it  
okay okay  
it should be the galaxy i guess  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
<unk> yeah  
okay  
it's under evaluation  
a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise  
you'd never need uh batteries would <unk> uh yeah  
right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so  
to create a control instead of a computer  
we'll get um warnings for next meetings as well  
yeah  
it has a name  
huh not so big like yeah  
okay  
yeah  
i mean  
the display requires a advanced chip which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip  
i i think it makes sense to um mark the whole thing then as one  
yeah even we can change colours no  
uh the numbers one two three four five as well should be uh yeah well not in reach because uh they don't use it uh all the time  
and each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must  
okay uh  
for philosophy students with an interest in language and and that's it  
although i only watch charmed so really i wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five you know remote ten remote one two nine  
yeah i would lose the curve  
yeah  
i think in a in a case of this simple remote control  
just the simple <unk> simple straight set of buttons  
al all circuit boards are pretty much the same i think  
and it's plastic as well so it won't be as comfortable on the hand  
it didn't the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information  
<unk> maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not  
so for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy  
um when you have got  
mm  
ah okay okay yeah  
is it on there  
that would be quite difficult but yeah  
oh god  
so will you go to the next slide  
and i mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league  
yes <unk> yeah  
always gets lost  
but if we have the um the locator then we don't have to worry about that  
i think it's probably i i do admit that we <unk> did miss a little or didn't <unk> didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the l. c. d. display  
that's a question  
you're not plugged in yet  
and also um there are different um combinations of letters  
okay  
well what conclusion we reach when we discuss it  
you can replace your t. v. with a new t. v. with internet browsing function but  
no we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot  
turn volume up  
um  
and that's quite a lot for a remote control  
uh  
um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines  
but um  
mm  
it's evaluated generally positively  
and what the fashions are for next year  
okay  
no no no no no  
what does that mean  
yes but  
alright  
we have  
yeah  
yeah  
you just say you know um whatever you whatever you want the remote for  
yeah  
to fruit  
yeah well i was just gonna throw out there the thought about um <unk> the remote control  
'kay  
um and then you'll just uh yeah <unk> you'll copy that over you won't don't move it over  
yeah  
well so you've got here's here's a transistor and this amplifies your signal  
mm  
basis station yeah  
so we will depart  
okay yeah  
okay  
uh <unk> yeah it's <unk> it's rubber  
it's an uni an unique feature and um i think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights  
let's see  
maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have  
mm-hmm  
so that indicates that there's an menu under that menu  
no the t. t. x. t.  
mm-hmm  
so as you can see here for example the battery  
so who speaks to whom and uh uh  
tomato  
there are two different uh uh solutions i mean  
yeah we think so too  
mm-hmm  
i mean how often do people say remote on t. v.  
right um i have a little thing  
is that so so what are we deciding to do here  
environmentally conscious or something  
mm-hmm  
okay um let's give it a number  
um and the price that go with it with it so the simple push buttons are gonna be the cheapest  
that's not observed  
i think the <unk> oh  
um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say  
and and channel  
uh  
mm  
and we have speech recognition  
mm  
what did we find for new ideas  
and then i have to go out of the presentation because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but i can't draw  
um so the first presentation we'll be looking at is <unk> presentation  
uh yeah i can imagine i can imagine that also requiring some discussion about whether what they do is what we actually wanna do  
here you go  
plus five  
if it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also  
i don't use that but again uh i might  
oh yeah  
am i the only one who needs it with frequencies  
<unk> yeah  
um fair enough thanks for the input <unk> always good  
um i think we're gonna have to lose some of these but the moment as it stands it's um  
maybe you would  
okay third findings  
yeah  
which channel selection  
i'm sure we have that  
yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result because that's always the difficulty  
yeah  
so many phone calls  
there had to be some kind of trouble along the way  
but even i think it's really bit like impossible for the really big systems i guess like storing storing itself  
you have to consider it uh  
okay  
yes  
um um the method i employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um <unk> them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant  
okay good  
it's just the fact that you need to <unk> uh it's just the fact that when they reply to it you need to be able to uh access it  
mm-hmm yeah  
and you were in the market <unk> to replace your t. v. remote how much would you pay for that  
and your role in this is  
mm-hmm  
well  
my personal preferences  
oh  
mm  
variety of colours are nice  
uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing  
<unk>  
see i'll probably just be starting stuff then 'cause i'll be starting the uh s. n. l. p. thing and the d. m. project  
um and also as opposed to last year this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel  
yeah yeah sponge yeah yeah at least that's  
important <unk> or mm yeah no  
you know brightness and tint and stuff  
yeah  
uh uh what's the difference with  
mm-hmm  
um what other things do we see here well um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel  
yeah  
yeah never closes the process when he does it now  
interface concept  
adjective  
it could be <unk> on the outside and <unk> everything could be inside  
well if it doesn't work  
double  
yeah if it's standing up it's it's on there but also we're gonna have the company name on the front  
i in a sense  
yes we did decide keck was going in  
yeah  
okay  
i <unk> i i figured you would  
'cause you were the responsible person in the in the class room  
do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other  
yeah  
yeah because this this is used for both  
okay  
no  
such a nice thing  
great  
mm  
no the button would be in fact it it should be something odd shaped with a spongy cover  
but it was pretty hard to tell that it was <unk> not not perfect unless you heard the samples sort of next to one another  
that might not be <unk> as a uh monologue but as a dial uh no no no wrong uh not as dialogue but as um a monologue  
so we have to use the ditch the titanium i'm afraid  
um um um yes i see  
well but there are two parts in this remote control  
well i mean it's it's the same like when you are doing l. p. l. p. synthesis right  
some things that i drew from this are that i think we were correct  
i had the the the <unk> there are speaker that never look at the audience  
you know  
um our next meeting will be in half an hour  
mm  
yeah but i wrote it down  
yeah  
<unk> heather could you push it down  
oh okay yeah  
no  
<unk> it i mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse but held  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
so uh actually they they have some something in in a textbook about the exchange  
getting new <unk> which are <unk> which are more informative by somehow integrating some extra knowledge like uh prior knowledge and <unk> information related to the problem and then use this posterior estimation uh uh method uh for designing hierarchical uh speech recognition system  
oh right oh  
in the beginning you said something about you were doing this <unk> um and you're doing it on the <unk> data  
you know channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential and the power  
'kay any other ideas  
it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and i think we might be moving away from that you know so um  
but  
pro ecology consumers  
mm-hmm  
oh well this is the the closing already  
yeah but they base that on on the user specifications  
hmm  
wherever i wants  
yeah probably  
hmm  
it's just picks the top ranked ones at the moment  
well they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet  
there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase  
you did your homework  
no i just put them there to uh yeah uh for general idea  
uh oh what have we done  
and you want to know those things  
we could make things much more <unk> i think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better  
did we  
three buttons you mean  
um i <unk> i know adobe and things have faculties that do it  
i guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among  
i mean just uh well it is <unk> just few few few times we talk together and it was just  
sure  
so it be uh a multi purpose uh very technically uh high uh  
okay and um colours materials  
yeah  
uh  
all kinds of possibilities  
yeah the <unk> be different anyway  
um if i'm speaking very uh how do you say it um yes i'm just speaking one word every uh every one second  
hmm  
three or four  
mm-hmm  
in this main in this routine  
you have to finish it completely then download it it's then start a new one  
that's good  
right  
or something  
but i my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that  
yeah <unk> i just think well i mean it all of these things when they encounter a new genre of um of uh actual data  
okay so we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have  
block book for how long  
uh  
yeah  
well i think i think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're <unk>  
on it  
yeah but  
you have it also with words that are much higher ranked  
the <unk> the whole picture  
just about each different  
maybe just make a note of it and we'll have all the discussion at the end  
you've already done that  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
rather than doing up down and uh a mute button  
yeah but <unk> you know the traditional t. v. it's um  
i would say six  
you can get a lot more information on it  
mm-hmm  
i uh hope so yeah  
oh sad  
okay  
so  
yeah yeah <unk> i it's hard to say from this picture  
yeah  
i have to offer a plastic rubber wood or titanium  
well great i think  
experience with with remote control so talk about who who's used what  
we're going to uh go to our uh rooms and uh we'll have to decide <unk> things on our own i think  
so i guess <unk> we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting  
oh i see  
it'll look like it's quivering you know  
you open it it can break you ca you can do various things  
right  
because that's what we want  
um  
okay  
because they'll if they're gonna do it by gesture they'll build up a convention right  
i tho i tho i thou  
oh i don't know  
i'd give it a six like i'd i think it's probably more handy than my current remote  
but i th i think the you know the h. c. i. part of it didn't quite work out to how they planned  
first  
the one with dash that signal <unk> and when <unk> <unk> when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds  
um  
yeah  
no no no no no  
have to remember that one now  
yeah  
after the after the hard drive crash we took the time to actually rebuild the the the system and actually train 'cause originally we sort of had the idea of oh we'll use a <unk> that's been trained on a large amount of telephone speech data and that should give us a better result  
okay we'll <unk> we'll say two point five  
okay  
i mean  
well in in euro in in paris and and milan the in paris and in paris and milan the the current trend of uh of clothes  
it just  
um as well marianne works closely with <unk> and the other marianne  
drop the special colour  
it's yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine  
um alright  
i want a share in the space rocket  
okay  
or wood even  
'kay  
but then we'll i think we must discuss who uh what will be better  
yeah  
okay let's stand up and support you  
it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out i'd say possibly based on  
you're saying you wouldn't know it was soft unless you'd  
with our microphones still attached to our bodies  
no  
come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one  
yep  
yeah  
fruity  
you're not supposed to be <unk> transcribers here  
i use my thumb  
um it was whether we went for the simple the regular or the advanced chip  
it's not a yeah  
yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually  
yeah  
i'm a geek  
maybe too well placed yeah  
oh thanks a lot  
so <unk> if you have like five megabytes or ten megabytes of models then yeah  
well i thin i think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements you know  
massively yeah  
my god  
but yeah  
well yeah if the technical functions have to be designed i i've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be  
yeah okay but but yeah that's just  
<unk> was a <unk> i i tell you what it stands for statistic and ad and something ad and uh perceptual approaches  
tends to be people talking and um you know how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t. v.  
i dunno <unk> because if you have the  
sixteen euros  
sure  
okay so maybe if we go on to evaluation <unk> criteria and then we'll there i suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues  
yeah  
we have one  
so um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote and yet you don't wanna have five remotes  
mm-hmm  
the the  
like maybe just like a little bit <unk> a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner  
yes don't include <unk> spectrum  
okay  
reasonably  
that's obviously the people i work for uh that work for me uh they've just you know  
okay here is our project  
the most important things on a <unk> on an on an uh remote control are channel selection volume con selection  
so we we can go for  
let me just  
yes definitely  
so we can go for the look and feel of the the left example and then a screen on top of it  
uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million  
but i think it's good to follow the <unk> flow and you know make it now and after  
uh i think so  
yeah aim for a an income group  
mm  
right so you it's same you'd start with the leaves and you go oh i want a topic segment  
i th i th oh  
but it uh might be some kind of uh uh information which might benefit meeting actions or some more high level decision making or problem solving  
but we can we can find  
hmm  
yeah  
and the older people spend more money and easily on a remote control  
like like if if if this directory uh uh company would like to extend this directory to new pages without the hassle of having human <unk>  
amazing  
okay  
there's an action to create a new part  
so that's not a good idea  
but but uh otherwise i mean as you say to do it in two years <unk>  
so you were saying the scroll buttons  
well it doesn't really resemble any fruit uh that's true  
oh i got a nice little screen here over here  
it it isn't worth it  
alright  
i think that's um well done everybody  
uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition  
oh  
okay that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one  
when they buy it for the first time  
yeah  
yeah i know  
um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a t. f. t. display  
great  
one day  
i th i th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there people wouldn't use it anyway um  
mm  
this is uh incremental but once you press it for a long time you go five by five  
okay just one  
yeah  
well i'm not sure i have to ask with manufacturing but i'm i'm not sure that's what you want  
yes  
um  
um we would just have a t. v. remote  
for the young peoples i think scroll <unk> good  
yeah  
i would say i mean it should be probably designed for a right handed <unk> person  
i thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary  
yeah but that that's not that's not this question  
i dunno how expensive an l. c. d. screen is  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
so you know the th the person might want to have a uh  
yeah  
so in in a given room there might be more than one remote control  
they just want to get something new you know  
but uh it's okay  
okay  
okay  
and uh i dunno but uh i think usage of a speech <unk> uh <unk> <unk> can be good  
okay  
mm okay  
ah here we go  
<unk>  
new information about the product requirements so you will have to  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
this is not <unk> maybe not as important as the other one but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use  
exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff  
they have to look fancy  
no  
mm-hmm  
without without l. c. d. without speech recognition it will be simple  
yeah  
if  
this sample sensor uh requires an regular chip i thought  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah like the shape of it almost like a mouse with a  
looks like a fish  
uh also for you maybe when <unk> you it's very nice when you can be <unk> when you can be trendy  
yeah  
yeah okay  
and uh how big is the remote control uh going to be  
should yeah  
uh no  
'cause a <unk> a primitive version of the sound to have relatively soon would be good  
so reasonably is four is one  
yeah but it may happen that uh for ninety <unk> ninety percent of the frame it's different  
and i'm talking to it but i still need to point to the television because it works with infrared  
then it depends on the cost  
and of course we should have our image  
heavier um less heavy laptops  
speaker yeah  
yeah  
really  
right  
okay  
into the more compact and uh okay  
um yeah  
so  
it's part of the logo  
and  
mm-hmm  
see what happens  
right yeah  
'cause i'm only gonna do it on small documents  
that's true  
yeah  
first teletext  
<unk> a question i have in in a 'cause i i i think i agree with you on we gotta make it a box  
me too  
but then we have to scrap l. c. d. display we have to scrap uh  
no  
because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got  
hang on how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there  
so we are still <unk> speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one  
uh-huh  
so for the next um before the next meeting <unk> uh <unk> shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on  
yeah  
i i i prefer rubber  
and so i mean there are there are really two ways of looking at this  
yeah that would be some development work  
or  
so you can use it in uh in this way  
you then go and change things around and then go back  
gentlemen thank you for your cooperation  
yes  
so still half  
uh  
so in fact it actually <unk> we won't be <unk> in a sense  
yes but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty  
and in the end i'll um show you our target audience or our target product users customers  
but yeah  
you prefer a round  
careful  
yeah okay  
yeah i think we uh we have special colours  
okay  
what  
so but then  
but maybe it's better than plastic anyway  
orange  
yeah and just yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools  
yeah so you can't actually cut it's like three times the number of buttons four eight twelve  
commas  
maybe still with a rubber design we could  
yeah  
i i figure if you had two different remotes you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it  
mm-hmm  
we need we need to have um um remote control which is <unk> fancy  
i suppose  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so first we'll have the prototype presentation  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
because just to make sure that and yeah  
the i suppose so the utterances  
the result the <unk> what you need for a join action you need to yeah a construct and a part two parts <unk> whatever you're taking together  
wow  
yeah  
because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time  
exactly  
yeah i've got one too  
ah  
but every word does does the word picking like does it always have the same information value in your thing i does it depend on its position like  
he's ready for it  
yeah <unk>  
how presentation of course  
hmm  
right okay so  
i uh  
they were not uh very uh trendy or just uh  
here would be the volume  
okay  
what kinds of things do you think people are actually gonna need  
mm  
yeah and we also have to yeah  
so  
so anyway uh next slide please  
so  
because they don't use it  
of the uh titanium  
so this might take more time than having to click two times on two shots rather <unk> <unk> than uh having directly a scene right  
so we need more than just uh location if we want to uh  
a whole set of uh different uh remote controls  
because it uh i i mean what do you touch the button and what do they want spongy uh uh devices or or i  
okay  
really  
yeah then <unk> then you would have to to make it like this  
we can we can raise the price twenty percent you know we like this idea this idea no  
so it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions  
and it's i it is very ergonomically designed  
right um  
and um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it  
alright  
yeah  
well  
i didn't find the didn't look but uh i didn't look but  
this is not the final design this is just a general idea of how i'd like to see uh basically the general idea  
so what could i draw  
because i i don't know you very well actually but yeah  
so  
yeah  
so  
th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it  
on self timer  
maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh does it  
mm 'kay  
seven  
and our slogan pasted somewhere on it on the the bottom or the you know  
i think <unk> <unk> <unk> most televisions nowadays do this  
yeah  
i guess it could be abundance  
<unk>  
yeah  
mm  
okay  
okay  
when this uh statistical test it can be we have made an experiment we get a result somewhat counter intuitive we give an explanation  
i <unk> yeah that's awesome  
but why don't we just write it as a new x. m. l. file  
like the citizens advice bureau is so hard to actually get access to because they've they have so many cases and so few people  
nothing  
i think it's quite easy to so <unk> zapping but maybe it will be too fast  
okay  
yes okay  
yeah honestly speaking i was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially but it's seven inches  
gateway arrays  
so that which interesting it's you don't really need to do a lot of computation  
they are on  
oh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
potentially yeah  
light bulb as well no  
we will be rich  
uh sorry  
do you wanna put your cord back in  
and this is anti r. s. i.  
so i think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have  
mm  
if you go on to <unk> uh findings it's like two or three slides down  
but  
dunno  
three  
no <unk> yeah i mean  
um  
yeah  
i think is the the the issue there  
okay for this budget like twelve euros  
and you can run two in a row but probably not up to three  
no  
and start a new black uh doc a blank document  
real reaction  
this just an acquisition card  
yeah yeah  
and you've got all this stuff and you're just like what the hell is that who is ever gonna use it  
fruity  
um the basic function is to send messages to another system  
and basically the <unk> was appearing in a sort of as a mirror image of what it was like in the uh model builder in the actual yeah  
where do we want the microphone for example to be  
mm-hmm  
i should  
i think triple r. is cool  
no uh <unk>  
yes  
five minutes left before the meeting ends  
um  
yeah that's okay  
yeah  
i will <unk> the things we discussed and put it in the project folder  
'kay  
yeah but yeah most of the t. v. <unk> have teletext nowadays  
no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go  
oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote  
to  
charger  
okay  
yeah  
and we've also been looking at sort of <unk> sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment  
yep  
well you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh  
think we can first  
i think maybe numbers seems is kind of old fashioned  
so i propose the easy to use uh prototype  
okay  
yeah  
so  
no but the problem is you're using only digits so maybe that's how you  
try out <unk>  
so that  
yep  
but the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email  
and then finally say okay exit  
you mean the frame grabbing card  
so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with <unk> for instance then uh the t. v. should have <unk> too in order to communicate  
yeah but then the code word would be even more important because i mean sky advertise on every channel don't they you know  
we just have sorry i'm going  
right  
um it shows the relevant and most used functions  
you know they've identified these seven different tasks people might wanna do with browsers um you know  
uh only if you uh check the notes or press done  
well how uh  
because that's the kinda normal thing to do  
yes  
well we decided against the solar cells so  
hmm  
hi  
yeah  
well i can just leave you guys here you know  
okay  
well i i will  
mm-hmm  
so  
i mean  
mm  
yeah it's more like tam  
yeah  
okay  
yeah i do too  
ready  
maybe <unk> make it bigger  
so if you just remember the colour that it was last at and you re draw a line behind it of that colour and then the next one  
good afternoon again  
whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something and page after page  
um weed out the numbers or should we just say to them oh you know we're having this thing about language and  
um fancy is is is is the you know highest priority  
'cause the thing is we can like this at the moment <unk> is working because it has a sound card  
mm-hmm  
this is gonna be a mass marketed product we can afford to have two or three different designs at least  
uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons but uh it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either  
uh  
mm  
well spread it by a big market  
mm-hmm  
um in our shared folder if everyone could go there right now um  
yeah  
of the product  
it could be quite a good brand like  
if they're if they're sticking up  
ah  
somehow  
yeah  
yep  
to fold and stuff  
okay  
mm  
and uh well the <unk> chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices  
well i'm typically i try to be because uh because you know i mean for <unk> this is also my livelihood right students  
whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic  
sure  
you you agree  
what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want  
putting in lights is cheap but putting in an l. c. d. panel just to make it glow is a bit of a  
one would like to know for example the percentage of time overall in which two people are looking at the same thing okay  
mm-hmm  
five  
and some play <unk> are actually i think edible aren't they  
so  
you see now you you have it quite central  
yes i do  
it's like a pear or something  
re relevant most used function  
makes sense  
obviously the the <unk> it has to be branded  
uh with the type and uh the the supplements  
so  
we might be <unk> you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose  
yeah  
r. e. i. s. s. a.  
and then we have the <unk> sample speaker sensor for speech recognition  
sure  
yeah  
right  
you have to <unk> you have to back this uh uh ha <unk> specially petr  
no the industrial designer will take a look at the working design and the in uh <unk> interaction yeah okay  
uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes  
mm-hmm  
uh now is a feature part of <unk> feature  
on the buttons  
i i thought we couldn't do that  
okay  
we still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group but not lose the one  
you you sell their product as well as your product with them you know  
it's like a pumpkin or  
the and what's on  
otherwise it could also just rely on the frequency band separation and detect that way the different persons and th then you don't really know where around the table these  
could be a red apple yeah  
yeah <unk> rather than focus on  
or something like that  
just you know  
you look up  
activate and th the yeah  
oh okay sure  
they will uh appear this frames will appear  
mm-hmm  
mm you can point to low red shift damped lyman alpha absorption 'cause you're shifted in the spectrum there  
yeah  
like for instance here i i see six but i don't know whether this was for <unk> or for uh chi <unk> chi two  
i mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah  
i think it <unk> it gets annoying  
yeah that's true that's true  
so if we're doing yeah  
yeah  
ye yeah 'cause i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume  
if we had say twenty linguistics and even then  
yeah  
so energy we oh  
yeah  
creativity seemed okay  
nope  
so you you have to buy two things the banana and the basis station  
we haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a l. c. d. but what are we gonna display on a l. c. d.  
two bits for for phase  
<unk> which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers  
so  
as our programme manager <unk> pro project manager says that without l. c. d. it is going to reduce the cost also and it's going to be much simpler to use  
the remote control hasn't got uh  
so that's what i wanted to tell about elephants  
the idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it for example with fruit like a shape or whatever  
but at least in <unk> we have this numbers <unk> is almost kind of free so everybody is using so that's what we are doing no  
okay  
here's  
so i it's one of these things where everybody's supposed to bank as many things as possible  
i usually  
so it's mm  
maybe it's easy to pick  
or do we just then transcribe  
um and then of course to make sure that you really um  
uh <unk> doesn't need to be sun  
<unk>  
yeah  
i don't think that's to taxing to uh  
so i think it's very good looking and not only for youth uh young people  
okay  
and the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down  
but yeah it uh  
yeah especially since i've just especially <unk> since i've just switched them around anyway  
and  
so  
yeah  
and uh really he likes to write things well  
yeah  
<unk>  
it could be you know really quite small  
uh  
i think it's just <unk> now we're going for the basic design  
i will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that i have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder  
yeah sis  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research  
yeah it is  
how it works is like they give all the pseudo code kind of thing and then they put severe test conditions  
uh material i think kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit but i think we have two different options  
saved two euros on that  
or <unk> something special like uh m. p. three player inside of it or uh oh well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably  
oh oh oh compression  
did you have had stages of clarification or i suppose you did right  
yeah what's the next uh phase  
okay  
in <unk> we want to detect that uh this points in the middle is higher than uh  
zapping functions  
i'll i'll show you the  
mm  
right first time this time  
okay  
well  
they are they are <unk> they they chopped so neatly for the it like custom made database  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
next  
yeah  
oh yeah  
i think uh we need to go a little bit through the code and i would be happy to to to help to to for instance the classes about video structure  
um so i'll i ca i can easy double check if uh <unk> can't find anything  
no  
yeah  
yes  
usually in products and resources  
um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code  
<unk> line ratio is after <unk>  
okay  
the average will uh come later  
um we're kind of running out of time so if you could  
okay  
so the carrier is if you know uh amplitude modulation right  
yes  
bottle of champagne  
mm-hmm  
now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it  
yeah  
no the colours are uh it's perfect yeah  
uh personal preferences just some imagination the raised symbols i thought were good the l. c. d. it does look smart  
yeah  
um they're nice kinda clearly labelled  
yeah  
so it's the same  
going to <unk> like north carol i'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the <unk> in san diego  
no but still there is there is still <unk> that's why like people come  
so this i was trying  
i would say the wheel is better  
mm-hmm  
true  
the the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product  
uh  
mm  
yeah  
right  
we're trying to <unk> to  
nice  
you mean you meant eight kilo uh sampling frequency  
no <unk> alright  
they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control <unk> are bad and um cause <unk> repetitive strain injury  
chip on print  
because younger peoples are <unk> critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing  
lefty <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
true  
so um let's go through the  
yeah  
but there are many many things  
oh  
and not too basic not a basic remote control who everybody already has  
yeah i know i <unk> it seems like it would suffice to have just the r. r. on there  
in the lounge yeah  
let it be universal so you want to use it for your hi <unk> system  
no we've established that the costs weren't really within budget but we could <unk> you know do it  
wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button and if we could reduce that  
well this about it i think  
um  
you know  
the <unk>  
well ask your question if you want  
um we want it to be um  
um yeah  
good  
hmm  
hmm  
there we go  
this seven inch t. f. t. screen how big is it in reality  
okay uh for for uh the noise sensitive table project um we decided to um to take the noise uh as input  
i i suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh  
yeah okay  
play doh time  
well but it's it's just an a approximation  
mm  
if it does ask d. f. k. i. either for data or a time scale and you're gonna need to know how much data you need in order to do that  
i feel like i'm hiding behind the equipment rather than the equipment is helping me and you know  
yeah  
the they're differently  
just go you you the closest to the <unk>  
yep  
some data  
and all these uh file are only uh internal  
well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive  
and so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach  
um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements or different offerings of what components <unk>  
are you ready  
yeah  
um but you know just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of  
spongy also  
and also i di i did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five  
so this is a engineer <unk> one so you see it's rather busy but it also lets you play your movie  
yeah that was already decided  
but less of them will buy it  
so that's just changing two lines of code  
so  
mm  
sorry what was that last thing again there  
next  
yeah  
hmm  
well are are you sure  
yeah  
yeah maybe a <unk> a circle would be alright different  
not really i mean not so much 'cause we we don't have the l. c. d. screen we don't have fancy chip  
a receiver  
and so we are sure that we will have a <unk> acquisition with fire wire  
well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market  
you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now i wouldn't worry too much  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm even if you would <unk> change a c. g. i. for instance  
well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it <unk> as well  
keep <unk> keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five euro unit so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh  
you can just pick the the um the harmonic <unk> on that spectrum when you reconstruct on that smooth version of the spectrum when you reconstruct  
right  
yeah actually it is  
um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions  
okay  
is that two or one  
something  
well it's better than my idea about solar probably  
that's in a newsflash  
but if we're having a simplified display anyway <unk> that we probably won't have to focus so much on that  
possibly  
but i if somebody if there's been an argument so far in a group meeting  
yeah  
i don't know it's manageable but we will uh we will see  
yeah  
is it  
no  
yeah <unk> <unk> that's uh that's a bit an optional option  
um so something that could do n. t. s. c. as well as pal as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control d. v. d. <unk> but um you know i'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing  
don't play with it you just play with the features  
that the keys might be concave simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of  
oh is it locked 'cause i'm in it  
in the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a <unk> circle  
yeah we can go to the next slide  
which is participant four  
yeah  
we're competitive we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line  
yeah  
and i just touch the pad  
hmm  
that's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria  
um  
you were saying joe with the model builder  
yeah  
but um it you know  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's very funny indeed  
yeah kind of self explanatory just buttons whenever you need them  
do do they both have the same sound card problem  
yes but i mean you can reconstruct the the <unk> the th the entire  
well that's something with f. f. t. <unk>  
so it's not i'm not really excessively concerned about that  
and how can we uh <unk> aim a at uh the target group  
so we're talking about ten centimetres  
or not usable they might be like be able to put into scrap metal  
yeah  
<unk> line thing may be something we can look into  
instead of people entering in what time things start  
nothin okay something is coming up  
or a little bit of tin titanium  
so uh we thought that maybe we could put some kind of well separation  
uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions  
they they need to be <unk>  
or make it just push buttons  
because if if we're not then we'd probably have to make the graphical display display a bit more information  
that's  
the most important aspect is the <unk> the look it has to look fancy look and feel  
not sure but then why did this features you gave me like they're thirteen  
one more uh thing i'd like to say uh let's give this uh a name  
change the water every couple of months and buy in a few plants so  
okay i'll start  
because i don't have results like in speech recognition  
but we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though  
okay  
uh my personal preferences uh i also overheard in the last meeting that there <unk> we should use uh our own business colours  
then for <unk> as well uh important the corporate image should be <unk> in our product  
four four  
if you take your time too long i will uh eventually uh  
well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit minded remote buyer  
mm  
and the white board 'cause i actually i have some fairly concrete things  
yeah <unk> are very important though i guess  
like you uh said uh before  
with <unk> okay  
when they suddenly discover that they're they're assuming some analysis is in there and we didn't didn't put it in  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
because you can choose which filters you want more less or just <unk> of those bands  
okay  
depends  
yeah  
so they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't  
and that's that's less important than what the theory is trying to achieve  
so this sounds like it's under control and you're happy and you guys are telling each other what you guys need to know  
yeah  
we have to make sure that um if for example there's a spare reading room like we were saying before  
r. r. repetitive stress injuries and things and and  
um so i think that's what energy is referring to here  
i don't really get your last uh diagram yes  
right  
so  
so there is overlapping  
mm  
right  
but maybe i mean that would be kinda big and bulky  
and we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well  
but i think that'll go if i think about it enough  
yeah  
well  
it's less expensive mm  
a cube  
it it was calibrated just before this meeting  
but does it  
yeah  
alright  
see you in a half hour  
'cause we don't have money and <unk> we want the screen  
is it like a crank thing or something  
so try and get t. v. manufacturers to  
there are no visual display problems  
yeah  
is it  
they're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the t. v. sort of under the covers but you still use it through a teletext  
i was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it  
right right  
well i think we took all the components separately what we want  
but that should also be with <unk> should be also with l. c. d. screen  
so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh <unk> who are we targeting with this remote control  
and maybe use your thumb  
<unk> very good  
and how we're gonna do the detailing on it  
um single curve it's just a well uh you know it's just uh a nice curve  
interface <unk>  
now say i i say you get three topics that makes more easier to draw  
is is it <unk> just just just using it yeah  
fruity colours  
uh functional design then we do some in individual work then we have a meeting to discuss the results etcetera etcetera  
<unk>  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
well you don't you don't really have two clustering no no no no you don't you don't really have two clustering  
<unk> you can just you can <unk> you can keep it in mind that  
then we're gonna talk about finance and i've got a lovely excel spreadsheet that i knocked up in the last five minutes for this  
yeah  
but it's much shorter and it's mu much worse  
mm-hmm  
yeah it kinda was actually 'cause it was this part of the body was really dull  
smart in that way  
is it fully automatic  
hmm  
yeah  
that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be  
that would be a week anyway  
or even it can do it uh it can we can do it quite automatically  
mm-hmm  
um i added this could be one uh big l. c. d.  
i mean is a <unk>  
so do you need to add anything  
yes  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah in fact yeah that's why i said it's it's a frame number  
uh  
no but <unk> should run um the java as well  
you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and i was talking about <unk> being able to extend the remote control by having you know  
so i think a two is more appropriate  
that's the logo of the yeah  
well we'd <unk> only use f. zero when it was present though wouldn't we  
i think he's gonna draw an elephant  
okay  
um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be that refers to the material pretty much um  
uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so generally what i came up with in order to be <unk> to to have production cost of twelve and a half euros  
uh it's a little bit  
<unk>  
we did find a new idea i mean sort of a kinetic remote control  
so  
oh that's good we can clip them on  
i see  
well i think also it's a good idea buts very difficult to incorporate  
no advanced chip  
uh here we have a tiger  
yep  
you have to reach a little bit don't you  
you know  
mm-hmm  
and  
this is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be  
mm  
yeah  
because we are also both uh quite busy with other projects of course  
uh <unk> <unk> what do <unk> what uh you compare with traditional uh um <unk> traditional controller  
the shape is nice it's um  
yeah  
um just connecting this  
mm  
so zero  
kind of l. c. d. or something or  
oh it's got all the directions so don't worry  
but many other people and i am one of those people for example are much more general  
i mean how often do you use seven eight and nine  
mm  
right  
maybe two years it's dead  
this is our first team meeting  
yes  
well oh she's  
if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would you know technology  
hmm  
yeah but well what about the the new project's requirement  
and after that uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the <unk>  
no  
we all do  
um this is the kick off meeting for the day  
is uh okay advanced chip on print  
i know  
oh you mean our uh coach our <unk> personal coach  
but how expensive it is  
okay  
yeah  
um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want describing like the in order of how much they want  
then it could beep  
so that they could know how to use these remote controls  
oh you need to twiddle the <unk> thing  
<unk>  
mm well one i've had before  
yeah  
oh  
because people are just so used to buttons and um yeah it's it's kind of safer so we we need both  
i'm proud of it  
but i mean they do need to be able to identify it and r. s. i. i'm not very sure what that is  
but i'm afraid it's not complete  
they want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction  
the green board with the how do you call it chalk yeah  
'kay  
you just select one box <unk> yeah this box  
leopard print  
i just joined that set last week  
th  
mm  
there you go  
are the case the buttons the circuit board with the chip and the battery  
but i  
this is actually quite fun  
but i i think it might have been bit off more than i could chew  
half  
my god i've just gone mad with the underlining here  
but this can be done automatically right  
oh oh right oh well i didn't uh use it  
so but  
and uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands or  
then it's all uh  
so it doesn't draw the attention away  
it's the word and that looks if that word occurs again and versus how often that word occurs in other context right  
yeah all your designs are uh pretty much  
something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better  
yeah  
it's it's very easy because you <unk> you know how many channel are there in the  
mm  
it should be an easy interface with not so much buttons  
so we could have a separate room as a lounge as long as uh we pack the other offices  
'cause we weren't like voting on anything and i think usually like <unk> are good  
i'll say it's about three  
but and stressful  
well we have those buttons  
oh galactic stars  
okay  
let's see what i think this should these are always on top of the of the control so they should be here  
uh-huh  
functional requirements  
yeah  
like you can do all those things pretty much on <unk> as that's not as necessary to have  
so what would what would appear in the in the l. c. d.  
i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of t. v. though  
what's our error of measurement on location on the screen  
okay  
the they they're not talking to each other  
i <unk> well uh i  
i've just done a quick mock up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky looking uh remote control  
well we had the <unk> list and the scroll bar and we have the cradle  
so it could be  
well  
edible televisions it's a wave of the future  
mm i mean but they have well i i think <unk> they can and yeah they can <unk> you know store it somewhere  
yeah  
um novice users <unk> use this device as uh normal users use uh a <unk> a remote control  
i don't know  
so it yeah  
i have to do that  
<unk> <unk> we have we haven't talk about a but that's no a is very <unk> inexpensive i believe but it is not in the list  
yep yep yep yep yep  
banana <unk>  
no only one no  
this video is about four minutes five minutes right  
overall  
uh  
mm  
okay  
he would indeed uh get already the chapters that he decided to put there  
after all the l. c. d. just to display and if you have the <unk> screen you can make the display <unk>  
okay we're on time  
yeah for for multi for a multi function remote that's a mid market price  
so  
uh-huh  
and user interface  
the other thing would then be special material rubber wood titanium  
yep  
mm-hmm  
our main audience uh so that's people below forty uh prefer the following  
so um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog  
you can't whistle  
i'm doing that at yes  
but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo <unk> these type of cells  
<unk> uh uh until uh until accounts came along <unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them  
if it's rubber isn't it malleable anyway it doesn't matter if it's double i mean isn't a rubber case  
but still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone with the with  
fifteen dollars  
yeah yeah  
and this is directly linked to the direction of the person  
titanium gone and add plastic  
yeah it's fudge titanium  
you just <unk> uh  
yeah yeah it says something now adjusting  
yeah  
usually what i have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with  
ah  
no problem  
good  
just so again the double r.  
and the other thing you say we need to we need to keep it just television  
i'm uh tim  
yeah but i don't see arabian people speaking one two uh whatever  
well you know <unk> pa apart from apart all apart from waiting for the get get <unk> sorted out  
no  
yeah <unk> at <unk> yeah  
so now we are going for for a small lunch  
um  
two numbers  
so google dot com doesn't actually say the words search on it i think  
'kay  
irritating  
yeah  
so the the eye the the list is now updated  
some leaf to eat  
it ha  
mm  
the technical aspects of the way you acquire things should be driven by the kind of processing you want to have  
i i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing  
i mean if you look at their products on their website here real reaction i mean it's all pretty high tech and cutting edge  
right i think she's i think what <unk> talking about is do we need to put two here  
we can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem  
it's just what i  
yeah  
and then the spongy feel  
mm so have i  
sorry  
um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly  
mm-hmm  
um so what i did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future  
and the and the cost implication  
uh the the first thing we are talking about ex the experiment to see the uh if it's dependent or independent  
okay  
it will be an a unique feature of our remote control  
yep that's okay  
yes uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber  
you never know whether they're on right or not  
i think it's very <unk> because we're gonna make such a basic remote control we have to do something to make it special  
we have to count all of them or yeah  
this one's mine  
and  
quite how the best way to do this is i'm not sure but  
there's um an l. c. d. thing which we thought could i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us  
right  
yeah  
there is also um a speech recognition to store channel information names like you can basically if you have a multiple functionality say t. v.  
i mean you plan to do any partitions in three <unk> person rooms or like this kind of blocks  
i think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely  
yeah  
uh roses on it a and uh  
and also rubber because the younger people like that what we see in the research  
uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any  
i want to preserve it  
<unk>  
so you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one hit the one or the two or the three  
yeah so so so we've got like uh a big circle with a white circle in the middle of it for an eye  
if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it  
but  
olivier do you want to  
okay  
in fact you won't even you shouldn't even need either as long as you got java installed  
so um  
mm-hmm  
squishy and fruity  
maybe we should uh <unk> the discussion here  
i don't know  
so i said there's some problem with yours uh your uh uh the way he uh put the roll inside  
mm-hmm  
if you  
mm is there anything else we should discuss  
yeah  
'kay  
correlate is a dangerous word in statistic  
the buttons will be uh touch screen  
okay  
but well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place  
to create a kind of disco effect when you  
but in but there is uh some characteristic that are for transparency colour  
okay  
this really suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power volume and this part and this d. s. p. <unk>  
it might be optional yeah  
fifty one one two three four five six seven eight  
where does it says we have to make a remote because i presumed  
um yeah  
i think it'll run on on their dice machine if we're doing it in if we well we should definitely test it the day before  
no even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice <unk> or these things yeah  
yeah  
dimensions are you thinking about here  
uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah of the t. v. where you can put the the remote control in  
okay  
okay  
well i think they are  
right  
nope they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions  
yep  
<unk> look at uh look at the frequency  
ah  
whatever have to buy one every half a year  
oh yeah  
but well the um isn't it that if um it's a region of the spectrum that's <unk>  
um <unk>  
okay  
nineteen euro and that's for the multi functions uh d. v. d. v. c. r. uh catch alls  
oh okay  
we have presentations  
yes  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm mm mm  
anyways well teletext wasn't important and that's what i took  
do we still have the time  
component component yeah  
um  
it's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square um for the cameras  
but there'll also be a minimum one  
but then i i i  
like if we if we produce the t. v. <unk> then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there  
i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish  
well done team  
my favourite animal  
um yeah well i was working on this before i got my information  
i'm i'm not sure  
so i i th the edges are really really sharp  
is fruit cool  
yeah and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic you don't want it to think about batteries anymore  
i think it's the same  
it's uh  
and they're healing as well  
yeah  
not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote  
just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh it's not not a part of the remote  
okay  
yeah i think so  
i cannot imagine the transformation to get the modulation spectrum out of such a stuff  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
on the remote <unk> control itself  
okay well that's my uh  
but uh here it's not like that you know like uh-huh  
because he was doing everything in <unk>  
thank you very much brian  
yeah  
welcome back  
um still have to once it's re installed have to actually do a proper <unk> yeah of proper pilot and yeah  
mm  
and then you can market it  
projects  
i think it could be difficult in practice yeah  
so you'd have your you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there  
so let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away  
mm  
okay  
okay yeah  
yeah  
we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here  
well no but you see them in all sorts of different red red shifts  
um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote  
because um when i have for example um increased speaker overlap that applies to several turns of course  
which is representing the you know the rubber and the spongy <unk>  
yep  
yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
oh sorry  
pruning of <unk> matrix  
uh now we had as listed options we had  
thank you very much indeed i think that i think that's uh i think we can go <unk> for an early bath  
if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system so is uh modular  
mm  
uh play video teletext but also <unk> uh play c. d. if you use it your c. d. player the remote control will that one  
mm  
give that for red and blue components but i wouldn't probably give that for soft component  
uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards  
so what should i draw  
so  
mm-hmm  
so i don't think we should use the dynamo thing  
the digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to  
um bright yellow sort of design with the r. r. which will actually look like our logo  
it you're marking it as a fragment and that's what's important  
oh now i can think of so many other ones  
ninety nine or something  
now i don't remember was which speaker you in the <unk> in the example she showed yesterday  
uh what do we want  
the push button are usually extremely cheap but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor which seems to be quite expensive  
do we ha still have a power button  
yeah  
interesting  
that's not up to you  
yeah but it also has a place so exactly  
hmm i agree  
you go there and you go there  
estonia  
following that briefing we did  
but if you're searching for a word you need an index for the word and the utterance as well  
ah it's kinda like <unk> uh right well  
yeah  
and it's gonna be you'll try to guess  
um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes  
yeah  
it's an elephant  
you know where they talk about one object one landmark and then another landmark  
mm-hmm  
'cause uh so far i've just been using my own uh email address  
yeah  
energy source  
hmm  
you still need that  
the structure  
but they we we're going beyond <unk> <unk> given the state of the technology we want something that we <unk> we know will will work um  
hmm  
um  
like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things but then how you could go back to the menu and like  
um  
but that still won't tell you well how many <unk> are there that they're using  
just so one battery  
yeah  
can you see  
yeah  
oh  
so we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this  
all lights get absorbed yeah  
yeah i will  
yeah  
two point five  
mm-hmm  
yeah i think so  
and maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use  
and the same as feature  
yeah  
to make something flush with the case  
well and if  
not very clear  
'kay  
on off that's a possibility yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> this is about uh how we figured it should be  
martin david and uh and myself  
our audience these people are very like these uh features  
we were marking the broad absorption line as well as broad absorption line quasar  
yeah or like i guess what the setup of the house is too  
so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also  
no marketing has to actually create the desire for it  
okay  
i guess we can only choose one  
yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be  
you no  
in particular do they want an l. c. d. <unk> display and secondly do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control  
i think that's a good idea  
yeah  
the one thing we missed though  
i think the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're yeah  
uh  
uh these are just the issues  
but if you're unlucky it might be quicker to just write a very simple string component which is just the <unk> just a bar  
okay when it's just as 'kay but it's at the beginning of a sentence should the k. be <unk>  
yeah  
show which is the front which is the back  
me  
yeah but what is an utterance  
isn't it quite it's a little bit light  
yeah  
no he he got from you only  
plastic like but rubber <unk> maybe you know rubber like uh  
like the buttons and the <unk> things and  
uh-huh  
we should work in our own room right  
yeah of course  
um  
the the thing that worries me about this approach is that say the really really really simple example of this where your directory had two categories in it  
hi  
um yeah  
um they want also uh  
yeah  
yeah i think the last time we had a lot of information but at the same time not quite enough  
okay  
and that's the kind of idea we're going for  
yeah  
so i don't think you have to design anything else for that  
but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top yeah  
they've only just started <unk> that treating this as a legal issue is probably the right way to look at it  
yeah but we like some some curves or  
right  
it's in the royal proceedings of something or other somewhere based on a um an experiment that had blocks a model  
um so it you know we can do things more informally where <unk> you feel the <unk> are getting in the way of things  
and sample sensor sample speaker  
no no there's no painting only uh yellow or  
so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea  
yes  
yes you're right  
oh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick i think  
oh wow  
yeah it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it  
yeah i suppose i can easy look through and start writing up some documentation on it  
you can't you can select file and export and then those j. peg files  
well i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's <unk> when you have one that works both the d. v. d. player or whatever and the t. v. as well  
yeah  
uh-huh  
not so far  
i mean uh it's it's and because we don't have all the data collected or annotated yet it's it's very difficult to know isn't it  
oh yeah yeah dark blue and then and then very bright uh a yellow banana an orange  
so yeah then you can yeah  
uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation  
yeah okay  
but i think that if you want to do that  
yeah  
if i just double the display and you make a uh like a non <unk> up second dialogue acts  
yeah we really like we really like that design i mean it looks just like a logo that arrangement of the keys  
you think it i it <unk> it loads the whole of the segments file every time  
we have we have an information density score and and we'll be looking for something else to do  
mm  
yeah  
on possible work  
but th i think i think the i think it was to was it to do with aurora or something  
it's doing its thing  
oh okay yeah  
and of the two i really like i <unk> i like the banana but i i do like the chunk  
the second version is also simpler we <unk> uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also  
it's now  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
yellow okay  
small  
so false is seven true is one and  
'kay what about the following model  
yeah yep  
finish meeting now  
yeah exactly yeah  
mm-hmm  
its own track its own video  
um maybe  
yeah but you know  
no this is the other one  
read the like  
so in that case well it's fine then  
wow so they're kinda spiritual  
so we need to tally up how much our <unk> our product will be costing  
i'm sure  
yeah  
that's pretty good that's nearly a third  
okay the other one is a bit crowded but that's okay  
yeah  
then you also get elevation  
well i think again it's it we have a cost issue here  
okay  
okay  
yeah yeah  
one would be the whole thing  
you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round  
even more durable uh  
but i'm thinking i'm thinking kind of p. d. a. uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things  
volume up volume down and  
ah  
and that should kinda take care of itself as well  
then we can discuss we can  
what do you think on it nathan  
oh that's us together  
this has been long enough  
oh  
and because we do a lot of reading and things like that it does get used fairly often  
i'm sorry  
uh-huh  
you can you can erase with this er yeah  
if you have i think you <unk> i think the advanced options should be i think it <unk> the advanced option could also be integrated in the l. c. d. screen  
now this is like so the third column is the utterance where it occurs right  
so if i'm using my one at home  
yeah  
but which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options  
or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can <unk> be controlled through the device  
so  
mm-hmm  
yeah <unk> one means it's yes a very fancy and seven mean no at all  
i do i think it's a bit redundant actually  
it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros um  
yeah  
do they  
no  
yeah  
<unk> exactly it <unk> but better no person than a bad person anyway  
i have to check that out i'm not sure  
nah  
line width yeah  
right  
there's a <unk> <unk> and the  
mm  
we don't have charger  
so the project report  
um i'm just i'm suddenly <unk> that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels <unk> we still can just tell it to  
but we don't have any buttons  
<unk>  
does that sound does that sound reasonable  
when a button is <unk> pushed in uh a electric current goes through here  
right  
google and fancy  
i thought this was just <unk> giving us instructions for the re to do next but  
hmm  
some people don't think so but i know very affectionate cats  
guess so  
yeah  
yeah they've got no commitments and  
there was there was problems with detecting the sub shots etcetera  
where's  
i might just change my order of in which i do things and like forget my latent semantic analysis stuff until the weekend and try to really make sense of the  
okay  
um i dunno what we should decide on that  
and probably more <unk> just because it's more compatible with a <unk> a wider range of devices  
though because i'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this but i presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries  
okay great  
or little  
yeah  
okay  
yes yes they did  
and you i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your l. c. d. you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here  
mm  
yeah you can download now  
um  
but the other thing is that uh they're i'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project  
i did not so  
yeah  
i guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing if we run a bit over budget that might be okay um  
i like it  
for the cost inventories of other devices if you're using speech recognition or something like that  
okay  
technical  
let's let's take  
which does the stuff like like having a bar where the position is and stuff  
okay well so  
i'm theoretically free  
yellow  
otherwise it will not too advanced uh well  
the use of the laptops for receiving everything  
mm-hmm  
i th think it should be done in the program 'cause we're probably gonna want to change it  
okay um right i <unk> i guess that's it so we can now um  
and also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well  
yeah  
as we say we put the fashion in electronics so it has to be a fashion remote control  
and if you say it's just a <unk> uh normal colour it's a normal colour <unk> no one will see it  
i i didn't understand  
my name is rose <unk>  
yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it  
especially if we don't control the t. v.  
which is important for you uh <unk> and as well for uh <unk>  
yep  
so i cannot blame anybody but i didn't know that the whole backup can itself crash  
with what  
f. eight  
uh yeah i think uh then we can go back to c. t. s. actually  
but it should be th i think normal batteries not not like two or two uh  
yeah and to improve the system like  
which isn't very practical but that's the way  
yeah  
but if you estimated it over a second you should be able to get a decent estimate i'd i'd think  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mean it's better  
um and yeah and so these numbers here um one or zero these here um that's um  
which is more complex and expensive  
yeah okay  
yeah a simple <unk>  
so self timed  
like what like you know what am i really doing you know what is  
yeah exactly  
different  
i don't know  
yeah  
sure okay  
oh my god  
mm-hmm  
yes it's depends whether it has <unk> whether it means with low red shift damped lyman alpha cloud absorption  
anything  
yeah  
um each frame is taking thirty two millisecond of signal just to give an idea  
uh 'cause i mean what uh twenty five euros that's about  
anyway  
we have the slide capture from darren  
i think that's your ta  
so is this different from the original p. l. p. two stuff then is that  
well it's it's it's another approach it's more that our um  
um the remote control would be cheaper to design so that we'd have more money in the budget to  
yeah  
right  
<unk> or shouldn't i  
yeah  
so it needs to be trendy  
uh  
yeah i'd  
ah  
mm-hmm  
did you send it  
it's uh  
so let's go for the plastic  
so maybe we can jump to your presentations right now  
i just prefer it to be one thing rather than two completely separate things and then the added explanation of why it's not possible to have the same thing applied to both halves  
maybe you should another pen  
the the swedish one who is sort of her assistant  
more user friendly  
and that's what everybody does  
single  
undo undo  
<unk>  
or what we should take um in account when developing such a product  
very catching  
a red one  
okay  
sure  
it hides uh basic functions  
oh yeah  
okay so we should keep this button  
yeah and it uh allows you to map between the different i. d. <unk>  
alright  
<unk> <unk>  
channel one channel four yeah  
okay  
yeah  
so call it the snowman shape trademark  
okay  
um yeah  
yeah  
from my point of view yeah  
yeah  
well yeah i read uh i reviewed one paper like yeah the that's that's from no  
good good good job  
voice activation might not be the best  
and it's only next  
um but i guess not i thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem  
then your display would the the <unk> jump won't it  
uh  
mm you know on it's own in being so expensive  
secondly um that our remote control needs to be <unk> technologically innovative  
but then we would have to change um the information about who on which channel it was set um to by which person it was set  
they'd probably they'd like you more if you s. s. h. uh into another computer compress it there and then sort of copy it into the into the gateway machine  
yeah  
mute  
it's a fairly new thing in the department but it's being used pretty regularly or something that a lot of people wanted  
if we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition uh our circuit board will become even more cheap  
okay that was that  
so  
and i will <unk> getting strings of um information i'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular  
i like that idea  
oh sorry that's what i mean  
no it's in inside the  
it's the most boring task  
was that circuit  
three is fine for me  
you know like the the soft stuff but i don't know if it's possible  
and we also  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
we can use plastic which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice  
but you you would not use this you will not use the yahoo directory or <unk> the directory in the training step of i of the model okay  
um  
it's very <unk>  
right  
yes  
ah  
uh th the uh the electronics um basically the more features we add um  
so i think it's better when th the t. v. shuts down the remote shuts down  
but i don't know  
so what i'm talking about is i see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is  
but uh yeah well  
uh nope don't think so  
no but uh  
um yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
do you remember that  
so you have some oh  
oh so you need to borrow somebody's head and mouth and stuff to to run it right  
this looks likes a cat who has been driven over  
and then if you want  
hmm  
yeah  
um well um i think it's important uh for you to <unk> the basic function of a remote control  
but  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery  
okay  
okay okay  
but it's uh  
just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting  
<unk> well possible  
no more questions  
these are the main  
<unk> fine  
okay good  
yep  
one three and a few ones  
um so move to the next slide  
i think you can point to line pairs  
hang on  
right  
but <unk> we stay we stay here or something  
so um anybody anything there to add just kind of young professionals  
well i think it's a valid point  
'kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting  
yeah i mean see how it turns out  
ah so i was right  
and i'll send around the email when it's done  
so in in theory you'd actually just move the problem  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
yeah standing  
but uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be i mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to i mean if it's spongy then it's going to move  
and which you don't use  
we'll discuss about our first ideas about the project and then uh we'll close the meeting  
would also be a bit weird  
'kay  
in my personal folder so i i i think you can reach it from here  
mm-hmm  
just a small device  
so um you'd do you extract the words the raw text as well  
during  
or something we don't know  
useful  
next slide  
progress with the experiment well that's what we're doing now  
so we don't want to have any harm to the society so  
the <unk> between these two uh these two cards  
well as <unk> as long as yeah  
the buttons can be made of an uh a soft material  
yep  
we could just have the logo in yellow or maybe a yellow light for the keys  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
just to uh  
so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking i think that's in itself an extremely big thing  
yeah  
and then it covers the these buttons  
difficult to do  
though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh  
mm  
i cover myself up  
thank you very much  
<unk>  
so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you guys um so it's good you went first  
it didn't bother to tell me that on this  
and then other menus for d. v. as well as t. v.  
so that's everything then  
okay  
other than this  
so i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control  
so i mean it probably is worth looking at  
but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice  
alright so what direction do you want to go in  
uh on top of this there are uh the numbers  
yeah  
yeah  
still i i'd say two  
yeah but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems  
how <unk>  
you  
yeah  
yeah  
and then also try and add in technological <unk> innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap  
um users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls  
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty and you talked about that before  
the <unk> the mouse the gaze and the part are all layered  
yeah  
just an idea  
yeah that you can del  
i m. i. s. t. e. r. yeah  
we need to start making some more specific decisions  
so now  
okay so this these are the <unk> uh the criteria  
it's another one of those that doesn't really make a big difference  
it's i think well it sums up what we need to do  
that all <unk> also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah  
<unk> we  
but but the l. c. d. screen i mean is a very uh  
i'll have a big mac please  
there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on off  
personally  
mm-hmm  
uh i think that's well uh yeah  
and then if you do it with only with only yeah  
good day  
i can't remember the i can't remember the names of all the actions  
um  
uh well i was really thinking a lot about the i. uh the <unk> kind of gel gem tone  
okay  
yeah but we are designing just remote control  
but you don't have to do overlap  
hey  
let's see  
okay  
okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings <unk> uh of people in general  
hmm  
channel button should be <unk> stick together for example here in this section  
it's you  
okay so this is quite easy  
mm-hmm  
user interface as well where the words are <unk> um displayed  
well see i i see i i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product  
yeah this is all the speaker d.  
<unk> switch yes  
mm yeah  
we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition  
because sometimes you wanna go back and find out if this was just a particularly duff subject  
mm  
no no but it's another  
it's  
okay  
um we can maybe get a head start  
all it depends on who watch this meeting  
yeah working design so  
a <unk> a <unk> a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an <unk> up and down type of thing  
so it's there's distracting  
so i will manage all all the group  
competitors  
okay  
okay  
like uh <unk> we don't have to buy parental control  
no yeah because now everybody has internet at home so it's better to use internet then teletext  
mm-hmm  
so uh you know l. d. a.  
mm sounds interesting  
oh yeah  
but we still know that we can go down and right  
and that would enable you to to do it  
mm  
uh so we don't re so really  
no we haven't think above about that  
u. v. <unk> are right isn't it  
a and you you just need from us to hear <unk> what are the other <unk> front ends and other features to to choose or something  
is it  
uh i think that fancy we can say it is fancy  
well i  
certain certain demographic  
several vowels in there  
i <unk>  
i'd give it a three  
looks a bit  
yeah  
or you you can just buy that application right  
true  
yeah  
hmm  
you can go first okay  
well yeah <unk> if you want try a a a huge market if you want to reach a huge market  
do you think it will be cheaper  
ah okay  
yeah  
we have to go to twelve and a half  
and so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability  
and then all green  
oh good  
'cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it  
we said twelve and i'm asking if he can make one  
yes  
and <unk> so uh we can move to the next slide  
okay so so <unk> that would be good  
okay  
what do you think ron  
yes  
it's a kind of remote control  
okay  
yeah so i talk about the problem  
not totally well  
okay so so um uh  
yeah  
but then you start hearing difference  
or  
okay  
the numbers  
mm yeah  
yeah we have money for that  
okay  
yeah okay  
the display p. c. <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the <unk> on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice  
oh sorry couldn't see  
instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel  
mm-hmm  
so you have to pass those test conditions  
don't mind  
they th these <unk> are what they call the curves  
but um it's rather about an <unk> thing  
so if it's like an uh volume button you know you can go in and say mute or or volume  
yeah  
mm  
so he's run an experiment and it's all worked  
okay  
but  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
but the most what they what they find more more interesting more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current  
well if they were gonna do that then they'd force you to go to it  
irritating yeah  
um  
but then you lose a little bit on precision  
yeah  
i hate play do it's just <unk>  
that spins around like all the time  
she said that he <unk> you know to anyway i you know i mean i i don't think especially uh  
and  
okay  
ah yes yes yes okay i see that  
so he knows how to encode uh the hilbert uh envelope using like l. s. f. <unk> or l. p. c.  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh 'kay  
because we have en enough space for for making a an l. c. <unk>  
now the the only thing i i on the interface side of it is that i i i see the dilemma  
it's quite fancy  
and the games are in it  
yeah okay for the l. c. d.  
which is different  
younger <unk> group  
well the most most people have but not not everybody and  
yeah that that there's a balance in the uh for example take a page like uh <unk>  
yeah  
but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control  
well okay here's the here's the thing on the chips that i that i got  
okay  
right  
something with our company name can we do anything with that  
and then we need some way of knowing what the you can you can see adding these other analyses about you know  
yeah and well rubber is a more translucent product too so we have that taken care of  
do you guys like your tasks  
okay there  
just like you said uh well the most users <unk> uh you have a lot of buttons and you <unk> <unk> use you don't use them  
there's no such thing as a docking station in this list but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents  
mm  
you have nothing no free time on wednesday  
for right right  
uh i did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls of how they uh they look and information from the web that i found  
mm  
also also  
it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um  
<unk> <unk> le let's see th we have uh oh yeah button supplements  
yeah but that's not possible  
and he will always have that band width  
looks cool  
so it's pretty big  
hmm  
um we have got <unk> marked here  
ah  
oh  
but i mean i think that we we basically have to merge some of this stuff that's been done you know  
mm yeah  
or  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah they had like uh <unk> uh <unk> they you know they had this set up with the uh the microphones  
yes  
yeah i was like suddenly panicking at eleven when i <unk> god i just thought it would be very straight forward to get it going here  
okay  
the user can choose <unk> which one they want right  
<unk> it  
yeah it was done indeed <unk> to be more general than just to do the shot detection  
yeah  
but i tell uh at every ten milliseconds whether you give some features or not really matters no  
hmm  
okay  
okay  
so if we're going for fashion in our cases  
okay  
in which case we won't be up here 'cause we don't record twos  
like kids won't break it it's not breakable if you throw it around  
maybe we could sketch a so basically  
oh i'm not gonna be able um i'll do it on the <unk>  
and manuel is the industrial designer  
<unk>  
unmarked for her  
okay  
yeah that sort of thing  
yeah because uh i i <unk> i did uh the first minutes i did were were were a bit scratchy you know  
yes  
yeah i kinda had a  
unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe  
uh it's very cheap you you maybe you you you you come at uh  
um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself because that's obviously found in the television  
and that's because of cost restraints is it  
maybe in the menu  
mm yes but i think it's i i it's already there i mean the hard disk uh recorders uh i i've seen them in the shop  
that's that's newer than the  
is it possible to make  
not at all  
there's a little there's a little chip i think you must plug it into something and it produces a  
yeah  
no the thing is usually these kind of these kind of facilities are like no not normal so so they may charge more or like yeah yeah  
causes a problem um for left or right handed people actually  
'kay  
or something  
uh well the well the <unk> script uh <unk> just <unk> uh just says uh yeah  
yeah  
okay the evaluation criteria huh  
don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's <unk> at the same price  
l. uh l. p.  
sort of <unk> i was just thinking you know like if if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from two <unk> files instead of from one file is massive  
i think so if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight forward uh not curve design i uh it's too dull  
mm what have we done features  
oh yeah  
is that  
i would say two  
um we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design  
uh it's starting on the wednesday and the first day back is tuesday  
mm-hmm  
okay so so yeah it might not be <unk> uh it it shouldn't be too hard  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
to have two <unk> uh mm you wants to ha do you have two quality <unk> high quality and  
mm  
yes  
that's the only excel document that will be in there so it's there for all of us  
yeah  
so that's for the for the scroll wheel  
mm  
should be there yeah  
time is it  
it saves you i uh having to do write scripts to do arithmetic on that later if you know that these are numbers that are gonna be useful to you  
so the the the symbols won't fade maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons  
if the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough  
yeah  
yeah  
well the l. c. d.  
take care of it of it in your thinking in your designing of the remote control  
time is running we have to close the meeting in a few minutes  
do you know how how i can wake it up  
yep  
and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort  
so we need to calculate the production cost  
and most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used  
um probably something that <unk> sits in your hand comfortably sort of feels right in your hand  
yeah but a little bit smaller  
so instead of going down you just spin yeah yeah  
okay we're all set  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that i was going to say that's the obvious way to do it  
you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so <unk> you know what you're doing there  
so it's easy to use and powerful as the remote control a has only one button  
some like a two <unk> if you bought it in a two part pack so one part attaches to the t. v.  
yeah  
up  
mm-hmm  
mm  
so <unk> it's possible  
okay  
the only snag about this is that uh  
four  
yeah okay  
that was bound to happen  
okay uh simple chip on print  
okay  
new ideas found  
how much would that save us  
eleven  
um  
well we can shift that  
um yeah it's like a  
you've just got one lecturer talking  
um  
and it's in  
um and we just <unk> you know this is arbitrary but we had to choose something and not let it get too convoluted with um with choice  
right  
and it's cheapest all round it sounds kinda funky  
well  
yeah  
well and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy  
okay  
if you can't find time you have to say it now  
mm-hmm  
we've got about five minutes left but if we've finished then we've finished  
put on your mic  
too complex  
no for a professor yeah but  
so we will catch these things  
okay uh sorry  
uh screen size  
yeah  
so i'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
not practical  
so we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor because this factor is twice as important  
that's true yeah  
<unk>  
so let's see if if we can do the led onto it  
any guesses  
mm-hmm  
that was a reasonable start yeah  
yeah that spins around or something  
and  
um can we just go over that again  
uh teletext but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash  
mm-hmm  
hayes is another one isn't it  
mm-hmm  
they talked about it at the meeting that we went to in  
yeah  
i don't think  
also because people use <unk> mobile phones and they also have the screen on top  
i really i really think that's a really cool thing for surfing  
yeah a little bit  
uh that's the only curve you made not th uh curved like that  
be necessary but um  
th a a kind of bridge  
uh so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons  
we're we put fashion in electronics so maybe we can uh  
it's a part of the remote  
it's the same thing if like whether you play and it moves forward or whether you jump to a position through search  
i mean i haven't seen that  
uh uh we don't no want to do that yeah because it's quite tricky  
that was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder a really good idea  
yeah with  
mm-hmm  
all the experiments which he was running  
yeah so it's just like channel six six enter  
um then there's things like this which is a a a kid's remote  
right right  
but the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment that's fine  
mm  
mm  
um and then at the bottom we have our logo  
we weren't matching a h. two regions because it was a region i think was the argument for that  
so they don't  
so  
but to be honest i did like nothing really on it last week  
no  
there was uh a website uh  
um what does it mean  
for some people they're important but the primary uses are really really basic  
an another idea  
mm  
okay  
i  
okay  
mm yeah  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
the project i got was just for a t. v. remote control  
yeah  
don't know  
mm  
um and uh we we know we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um  
um alright and i'm sure that um  
thanks  
yeah  
so you think maybe a little too controlling or  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no l. c. d. no speech recognition technology okay we went through a <unk> to a banana look and feel for the remote control  
favourite channel  
okay  
alright  
mm-hmm  
uh we should keep it simple mm medium low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good  
are we going to uh do it like uh on mike's screen with uh one button that says i'm going to do a <unk> two number digital  
yeah  
hmm  
<unk> well yeah  
i see  
well you need some way to make sure that they actually notice the thing you're trying to explain to them if there's no voice uh  
okay  
uh yeah i just want to say it should be real smart  
will it incorporate like uh an s. m. a. and uh  
you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after  
but fruit and <unk> is the new is the new black for furniture for clothes for shoes  
like if we do a <unk> like a similarity search  
yeah me too  
um and then so this is <unk> with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas  
yeah  
it's like the like you said no  
uh is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch screen square  
okay yeah it's fine  
the uh um  
there were some boards saying that there is some panel discussion  
oh  
so we have it's a bit round shaped that's what we had uh  
well um  
you don't know  
so we so are we checking what's actually been transcribed already as well as the silences  
so pretty basic there  
okay  
like then <unk> you can say okay we implemented d. seventy eight or d. se  
they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all i really wanna do is switch on and off  
yeah that's true what you were saying i mean it doesn't have to have a flip function it can just have a lock function  
since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff  
so it shows you the target <unk> the clock whatever else  
yeah  
but  
this function should be very uh accessible  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um  
our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control  
i think it went quite smoothly  
but it's from the words file  
i think so  
mm-hmm  
no look it  
i'm gonna show you an excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro  
so two remotes in one  
don't <unk>  
like remote control is similar you're away on vacation i dunno whatever you something and it just starts to get worn down  
oh right okay so  
um yes  
you know a all the all the all the similar papers within one session say <unk> uh focus to this topic  
yeah  
oh  
i uh kind of opened it  
so fancy look and feel uh is the most important uh point of attention  
the phones and the  
but it also needs to have corporate identity  
okay um components concept  
oh yeah right we want it to it's not it's not no  
yeah  
no man  
and of course it should not be very costly  
if you go by channel you don't have to do that  
i mean you wanna <unk> <unk> flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also  
don't have no one to handle that  
the remote control is not ugly  
okay so most remote controls use graphical interface  
and what we need an <unk> good instruction booklet because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways  
because all the t. v. sets will be digital right  
mm-hmm  
<unk> okay  
yeah we have to probably cut that out anyway for our project i don't know  
no i think it's lost a battery  
rubber  
no i didn't get it  
yeah  
you type will not would or um if they say we even though it might be more <unk> correct to type we're um that kind of thing  
think we have to keep them  
yeah  
and  
yeah it might be difficult  
right  
but you don't know which part it was intended to replace on the screen because you can't mind read  
true  
uh house uh stuff  
but he obviously hasn't  
uh uh <unk> perhaps we should know reduce the uh you know  
but  
mm  
and the second one underneath would be the idea for the  
we should <unk> we should come up with a fuzzy one as well  
maybe not less but they may be willing to pay  
we did  
so we shouldn't allow h. or helium two o. spectrum either  
are we going into kind of novelty factors here  
yeah  
or  
and also it doesn't break as easily maybe i dunno  
in in a temporal sequence  
uh <unk> training  
i would like just to talk now regarding uh the the fire free smart meeting room at <unk>  
because it's uh easy it's innovative even if the cost is a bit higher and we also have to find a  
okay  
she said we didn't need to screw it in  
i'm sorry  
hmm  
it's uh  
and you're right because one's line formation and one's line profile  
um  
<unk> maybe we can change from th  
no idea  
usually this is less <unk> at two dollars per chip  
oh let's  
yeah  
yeah if we can afford it  
okay and and uh  
you're right  
um we can we can have your sort of basic double a. batteries but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery  
enough  
so  
mm-hmm  
of the music we see the the highlight of the dialogue acts  
yeah  
yeah  
it looks like it single curve 'cause of th the <unk>  
uh ye will go to italian restaurant or  
so no l. c. d.  
i agree  
that makes sense  
alright  
um  
i mean just use the same tool that we use  
is usually i've found an infra red device which sends a signal to the actual television  
as opposed to when i'll need an hour over three da you know an hour each day for three days  
okay  
so no problem to contact me until i don't know may next year  
yeah  
yeah yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world of course  
and this one the over sized one i don't know about you but i think it's a bit too gimmicky  
um  
yeah  
i've probably got a reasonable amount because um everything on my dice account can actually be deleted 'cause i store it all at home as well  
so you wanna go through basically the user requirements and you know maybe think about some user requirements of your own and make a case for  
but  
it's pretty nice  
uh so <unk> we need a decent end point detection system running before we can we can we can do that  
me too  
okay  
and remember as as i said last meeting  
okay  
who  
obviously that's not the case  
they're using our ideas  
but we can't drop three buttons  
and for maybe look and feel what about a a piece of ice  
'kay  
i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect  
you  
mm-hmm  
but uh you know or whether they can be put off for a little bit or something  
so  
and then we have to find i'm sure there's some way in in nite x. m. l. to just say set position to that time mark  
no kids need to know how to use a remote i would think  
okay  
yeah  
the methods  
that'd work yeah  
um so the <unk> basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set so that a desired function is performed  
yeah  
'kay  
exit  
um and we i guess we should talk to yoshi about about it in relationship to named entities  
so  
you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that  
so i myself would say a one or a two  
but you still include the acronym  
solar  
no  
uh that really yeah that makes it really quite difficult for us if we want to test our stuff the first have to fight for our computers without cards  
so if we go with just the  
we are almost there  
and the l. c. d. options are activated by some some software options <unk> communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah  
it was <unk> mm-hmm mm-hmm  
um  
yeah yeah  
i think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh no um mm usually  
but yeah  
uh it's on this object that object this fixed thing that fixed thing okay  
the <unk> <unk> you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything  
then it's possible to make  
mm nope  
sorry  
yeah we'll we'll come up to that  
yeah  
but the this also  
it's uh something we have to decide on  
so like i said changing channels everything hidden in your l. c. d. display so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything  
well yeah but apple would sue you for that  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
but  
well um because well i i'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing  
that's also why i sent you the mm <unk> software <unk> that uh the stuff that takes the ascii sort of format originally and then just uh sort of compresses it and things  
well yeah it shouldn't be minus two times it should be half  
uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case  
is any gonna try to anybody try to parse the ami data  
you'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept  
yeah  
me too  
it's got but if you hold it  
it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point  
do do processing  
um even with a three d. graphic thing it still it requires a lot of yeah tangible that's a nice word  
i dunno who and whatnot  
may may could remind some kind of vegetable some kind of  
yeah  
yeah  
when you get on the on screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus  
um production costs  
oh this is nothing  
but you know what i mean to <unk> sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy  
and for each one has his own  
um it shouldn't be too uh <unk> too slippery <unk> because um  
cool there we go  
what is an end report  
uh that's better  
mm on the other hand if we're having hyper luminous galaxies where you know they've just got ultra luminous and oh even more hyper luminous  
um  
you know differ some different surrounded words perhaps we have not enough data  
oh i mean not during the task  
um uh can't really see but there's two possible ways on the <unk> left  
or do they uh  
yeah  
um well the n. x. t. stuff will have the more complete picture 'cause it will include combine all the linguistic stuff with all the movements and the actions  
do we put the volume control and the channel control here or do we put it on he would we like to press it in the middle  
i don't know  
so what  
so we can make it uh special  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
let's  
sure  
uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as l. c. d. <unk> mm  
absorption features  
'cause i was hoping that steve would mention it ian 'cause we've mentioned it to him so many times  
hmm  
and maybe a low battery indicator  
what do you guys think about that  
still in progress  
right so agenda of the first meeting  
okay  
no the colour is okay that's fine  
battery  
it's just impossible  
breaking the power law index i think that's probably a you can point to it but equally it's not a it's something you've derived  
we'll have uh those uh buttons about uh  
um  
wait  
yeah  
so i hope uh that your respective <unk> presentations uh will help us  
no we'll we'll just wait and uh uh plastic versus rubber  
excellent  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
or  
oh okay  
yeah  
why are you looking at me  
well we'll see  
yeah  
i would yeah  
i should think so  
between the the the yeah the the uh  
broad line  
and  
um i found some uh interesting uh uh samples  
a simple yeah  
mm 'kay  
right  
it just like a matter of a a beep if you <unk> that you just know that that there's context  
so so what we want is whether they're looking at <unk> at the other person's gaze right  
okay  
so that's this  
so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use  
to see something else on my screen  
yeah great  
maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick  
okay  
yep  
so maybe i can switch slides when you whenever you ask that will be more convenient  
so he he he just uh he just uh put here the p. make environment and he didn't stick to any cluster or anything  
you don't buy a t. v. every week new <unk> so  
yeah  
mm  
yeah it's worked for the last fifty years you know  
yeah  
uh as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out sorry yeah sure  
uh it's interesting this  
hmm  
right  
great  
but uh you know mm some way we we we we cannot have a students and make him wait one year before he has uh the material to work  
i'm just wondering  
<unk>  
so our form and our function  
perhaps that's best  
yeah and probably it would look better as well  
yes  
or okay  
yeah  
or okay  
yeah i'll <unk> i'll try to present uh i guess it corresponds to your questions  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but there's uh enough space for the corporate logo  
to have l. c. d. and voice  
mm-hmm  
okay  
looking at the user uh needs we only uh don't we don't have the double curved case  
you know  
okay  
uh that means that it goes in in the water  
so that was my uh my personal opinion  
well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and <unk> type stuff  
yes <unk> what do you think i don't know  
like you wind up something  
bad estimate right  
okay  
hmm  
i dunno  
just  
no  
mm  
i'd make it a whole morning or a whole afternoon  
mm-hmm  
hang on  
but if you have carpets on the wall which our natural loving friends probably do have  
if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana  
okay  
if you don't drop it too much it's uh should last pretty long  
well i'd say two on a scale  
i must say that it  
and well you <unk> on the back you can put uh <unk> at the bottom you can put the logo with the  
i <unk> i never <unk> judge licences until i've read 'em  
chan  
you can point to a soft component  
<unk> <unk>  
no then it will won't uh stand up from the table  
yeah th i mean it it does seem like you know  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
buttons we're gonna use  
and <unk> where  
uh that's it  
and what about the strawberries on the top  
this one  
there's a kinetic option which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around  
the remote control's a good example for company's motto we put the fashion in electronics  
mm  
yeah well people go to buy another remote control when they broke <unk> broke their  
yeah  
accidentally  
mm let's try  
i see some interesting okay  
yeah i think so  
people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables  
so you should be able to use that for the search quite easily  
you cannot you can save it  
and and the scroll uh scroll wheels  
but i think ad should probably go up this week  
maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental  
because they use the remote control often more often and are more technical than the <unk> older people  
<unk> paper i  
so it's a bit square but it's also a bit uh  
so the last i think i'm sorry you know i had as assorted emails from you and i was probably didn't catch everything  
well <unk> ultimately i think this is the type of things but at this point we uh yeah  
numbers  
that's a yeah yeah  
there's only like three chairs  
how man  
but i mean it it  
so i think it's gonna be quite hard  
mm-hmm  
and then where is the  
you reckon you could like draw us a thing on the on the <unk> 'cause i'm not sure  
well hang on though  
okay  
needs to be an enter button but could just be the same as well  
yeah  
i'm uh marketing expert  
so you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit  
'cause uh al also just filters it  
so i can say whatever and you cannot reply  
yeah  
so i can go uh presuming i have on my television  
double curve  
he's using capitals  
though i think with digital t. v. like i know on my cable box  
that's a bit too much but no no no no but i think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually  
so i think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design  
yeah  
just  
yeah  
programmable memory as well  
yeah i i think that one button is uh i use it uh  
okay  
uh at least it's not something with numbers  
hmm  
this is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control who would pay more for it um  
yeah  
so ma i prefer to have the off button at the top right  
yeah free free coffee  
what do you mean by greatest overlap  
mm  
maybe with slides it's <unk> it's easier to extract uh the information  
first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus  
yeah  
you know to give it uh you know the soft touch in your hands and also to  
green is too old fashioned  
yeah  
okay  
uh  
so we just remove our  
yes  
it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting  
and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises  
again probably not what we're going for so i i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod uh with a hard <unk> <unk> uh plastic casing although i think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas  
yeah  
sorry  
ah sorry  
it doesn't look strong  
we want large buttons for the essential things  
mm  
and for the speech uh recognition part if we want to incorporate that we need a microphone  
it gives the <unk> oh  
yeah triple r.  
yeah which i think we should yeah they'll still be fine for the for the price  
uh i just talked to one girl there which told me that he would be possibly able to find me a job there  
yeah so it's <unk> like the values are sort of hard coded for the screen sizes in dice and my <unk> smaller  
yeah that has to be checked out  
so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score but not on the previous slide  
yeah  
ah  
i've i've uh eraser  
which doesn't sound too exciting  
okay the  
he's very good <unk> mm <unk> very good <unk>  
and also uh i think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier  
hmm  
no but no you're right and this should be red as well  
'cause all the all the algorithms you were speaking about  
yeah that's important  
if it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy  
now save  
so  
thank you  
so i dunno what you think bob but it would be great for users i think and very good for marketing  
the main elements of remote controls in general and therefore ours as well  
yeah  
yeah okay  
we're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah of course  
um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the l. c. d. display and it didn't say specifically  
is this positive or negative that uh big buttons  
mm-hmm  
mm  
i think that's the what they mean by a special colour  
and it's a little bit pointless as well i think  
alright let's move on  
yeah yeah okay  
yeah  
i i don't believe i know um  
yep  
the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls so it's yeah  
so uh  
like your zap zapping device is just <unk> channels up down uh volume and on off  
perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost  
but the front  
yes  
the second one  
by trying to think what is it thursday today i'll <unk> i'll do that by the end of the week anyway  
i got one question uh you are a market expert so should we aim at the young people or not  
uh one two  
can you tell just by looking at these how hard people find them  
yeah okay  
but um we should go for the user oriented device so simple controls and good ergonomics  
yeah  
no no save it and start a new uh save it  
we can have the slide from the slide capture and we can just use uh a video signal to to capture that also  
i don't know i mean i i i'd say a whole either a whole morning or a whole afternoon um at least  
got forty minutes to do this in  
okay then i go for that  
mm-hmm  
so  
mm-hmm  
yeah touch screen i've mentioned  
yeah he feels it immediately  
yeah  
the actual plastic or rubber hand held piece  
uh  
we'll try the controllers you'd prefer  
potato  
i mean do <unk> do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project  
right  
um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here  
third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire uh people used to uh  
'kay  
um now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh  
mm-hmm  
some functionality to indicate the battery limit  
yeah  
if not i'll average those  
so  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
but um  
mm-hmm  
but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else  
yeah  
well it's uh just a linear prediction  
exactly  
so  
um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp  
oh  
it's not actually what you are doing  
mm  
yeah  
i don't know  
i think i'm right  
right but i'm on the  
uh which allows you to to <unk> uh these two cards together  
that's true  
yeah  
yeah something <unk>  
well if yeah it is there is no possible productions for these videos  
mm the pitch and uh and the <unk>  
or do you think it rubber casing yeah  
i know but we had that discussion before and i'm confused myself about what i think about it  
mm mm mm  
i mean uh i don't it's meant to be that in depth  
i was just trying to find an advantage  
yeah  
and this is all over the <unk> paris milan and i'm talking about clothing furniture shoes  
but uh so  
yeah i thought i thought too but yeah  
well no but there are the electronic programme guides out there  
i think it's a three  
no everything we <unk> if th if they say that we cannot recover it then i can quickly get it back from <unk> in a couple of days  
um so what you would be feeding in would be just like one value per speaker per meeting  
if we'd had that sheet at the beginning <unk> been like okay  
they have all sorts of <unk> <unk> good  
yeah yeah  
let's assume that we say we don't do any scene thing then we could remove like for instance the scenes right  
if we're going to have them let's have them  
yeah  
well  
no  
i think that's enough  
it especially with a preview we'll be able to get tool tip fairly simple because it's just a property of it  
so it's up to you  
don't think so  
a fish  
hmm  
okay  
well i dunno do you th i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so  
no that uh is one thousand twenty four  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
i lost my uh presentation but  
yeah  
that  
yes  
but we do use an l. c. d. screen so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip  
uh we still have to make we have still have to make the es the the real basic design  
i think anyway  
so we we want to have a product fancy look and feel technologically innovative easy to use fashion easy to find in a room  
mm  
well i heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component  
appearance  
so that's quite cool  
okay uh are they really really strange batteries  
<unk> find the button buttons easily  
yeah but yeah i don't know because maybe <unk> uh yeah we have to find out with the simple chip  
well <unk> let's just get back to that  
yeah  
because um based on what you've go <unk> everybody's saying right you want something simple  
yeah i can change that  
yeah 'kay  
now in this case we would do it by per <unk> words per meeting  
that's that's almost uh fifty minutes  
at least one for power  
is really strict  
yo manager  
uh the basic battery which i <unk> prefer because of its uh its non uh non depending of of of uh um  
um yeah a three  
video  
and uh it was quite uh a swish model where it can control uh four devices t. v. cable satellite video d. v. d. audio  
yeah  
huh  
um so i guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report  
yes but  
you have the the power coming in then you have like a switch  
oh yeah i still have this  
apple for channel one  
yeah four thousand gigabytes  
okay  
you've got the scores  
yeah  
okay um also we talked earlier about r. s. i. and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal <unk> kind of thing  
okay  
the um yeah okay i was just gonna assign tasks in the next <unk> <unk> any <unk> any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool  
aspect  
maybe we could um  
i guess it was a fairly small group so all of us got to express our opinions yeah  
so okay  
um  
alright  
yeah within five minutes yeah  
okay  
i mean that would be because that would be what naturally came out of her thing  
he mentioned that they're not fun to use  
you could make a few <unk> very <unk> ones and uh a very traditional co cover  
which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and <unk> it all together for us  
so that's from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack  
instead of like a vertical up and down one  
okay  
yeah we can do that  
let's imagine  
you know i think  
alright okay yeah  
so i dunno if we need to spend time on that actually but uh  
it must make all the difference  
but are  
i mean we can ask uh uh in the sense that if it is a priority for <unk> so far we would get very good signals from that point of view  
yeah  
you know add this data a automatically  
so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed  
yeah  
yeah and stop worrying about the whole r. s. i. from the remote thing 'cause that's just  
and a four is neutral  
and one guy who was saying evolution each time he meant evaluation and it took me a whole dialogue yeah yeah  
and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros  
i dunno  
okay  
latex  
mm-hmm  
it's pretty cool  
but i mean the the thing with this whole if <unk> you're planning on making it out of rubber  
<unk>  
yeah  
but also for yeah okay  
is there anything that <unk> or anybody is after that we aren't supplying  
yeah  
and we're keeping line in 'cause its strengths yeah  
but anyway this is very simple  
yeah yeah  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
and then just have the simple sort of hand held thing that we sort of devised earlier as the actual remote  
good  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors and uh look at their uh remote controls  
'kay that's it  
maybe it but then we have to look that it uh <unk> uh will not um be too childish to see  
i think it's definitely got to be a a one handed a one handed job  
no  
and you can infer some label to a document of p. l.  
so it has to be soft  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and what about voice recognition do we have microphones  
i don't know if if it's user friendly  
mm-hmm  
well so it just th the basic functions  
by nine  
right  
built in end point detection et cetera et cetera  
but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon  
yeah so  
and what el what function do you see  
on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing  
yeah  
yes  
okay  
yeah well okay  
okay  
and we need we need it to be simple yet it needs to be high tech looking  
that's it  
yep  
oh we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty five then with an l. c. d. screen  
for instance like a mobile phone or something like that  
so be an option yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so but uh from now on i won't use my pen anymore so will be <unk> just ordinary keyboard  
okay  
yeah  
and then uh when make it you know nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand up thing  
or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features  
yeah the company strategy okay  
mm-hmm  
alright  
so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and  
but if you want to la uh yeah last longer than two weeks or something like that you can maybe  
uh  
yeah i mean i considering we get an email from uh the i think it got sent through saying that he'd updated the the whatever it was on the <unk>  
so it's x. m. l. just with the h. t. m. l. d. t. d.  
i don't know if that's really i don't know we got some <unk> crazy guys down there in that department so  
um and you have several categories  
do you want us to do our <unk> now or  
different feature combination yeah  
yes yes yes yes yes yes  
only be used for television  
so maybe i draw line here  
yes  
okay i'll give the floor  
yeah but why would we use it  
what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh i didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so i have to look what what is a <unk> a <unk> available on the market for for the communication for the i. r. circuits and so on  
hmm  
oh just kidding  
and then i think you should be pretty much converging to the system  
expensive  
the simple  
and if it's yellow  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah we we better so choose one  
um i dunno if you guys have got any questions for catherine on any of this  
like over the whole corpus sort of  
yeah well you need to you you and <unk> need to sort out yeah  
yeah it only costs four units  
it's the white part uh  
but then uh it's really useful i think  
nah  
yeah it's thinking about it  
okay  
that would be a bit odd wouldn't it  
yeah  
it shouldn't be too boxy you know  
i <unk> uh we were given  
mm  
so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands  
yeah  
real reaction <unk> i'm not quite sure what does that mean  
i put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them  
okay  
yeah  
i mean we're all here now i think  
oh  
it's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse  
then we have plastic wood rubber  
no you go and i'll uh  
yeah  
'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need  
so the grip is  
on yeah i've <unk> uh sorry  
or a student  
i mean it would be a bit pointless but it would look good for the presentation  
six to a dozen usually  
alright um can i <unk> steal this from the back of your laptop  
if you see it's like peeling  
that's why it was uh said in the in the use in the <unk> new requirements  
they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for t. v. not for d. v. d. and other devices  
yeah they are not giving you the time  
what's the normal colour  
um so i mean  
and personal preferences besides the fact that i can't spell we need a long lasting energy source people don't wanna be changing it a lot  
maybe uh maybe something to look into i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be  
yeah  
or uh uh more functions on the remote  
yep  
yes and then i just uh because uh we are using um uh an open <unk> an open source framework to do this  
it's too less space  
sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh  
so maybe in the middle or something  
i like the shape of them i do like the  
but it's uh right it's in a it's a little bit difference in not applied in the frequency domain  
um otherwise it it's liable to keep on running and you might not notice where it where it finishes  
yeah  
check your batteries  
i'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime after making a presentation  
um  
we just heard from the industrial designer how uh difficult it is  
yellow and grey  
oh sorry  
okay  
in the hand  
or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know frankenstein it's alive  
especially since kate asked to be last  
also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself but also in explaining it to the other people by means of uh  
mm yeah  
'kay  
yeah and we chose a v. plus and v. minus  
you know  
for for whichever bits of analysis you're trying to do from it  
yeah yeah that's right  
yeah normal plain you no normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop  
what controls do we need  
yeah  
from yeah it's it's <unk> it from words x. m. l. is that it's saying here  
yeah  
i take the image uh of the document and i take the transcription  
anyway  
at least six posters if you see what i mean  
okay  
that would work out fine if uh  
there isn't a way to figure out that you're looking at the square rather than the triangle  
almost  
not come across any yet  
mm-hmm  
oh  
but um we'll se i'm sure we can get around them somehow  
it's a cat  
yeah  
<unk> surely he's in the wrong age group  
titanium i <unk> i think this this is this is <unk> really good re remote  
you have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface  
so whether like you use for training or <unk> you can you can do like data driven or like model based approach or whatever like  
mm-hmm  
um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one  
i but i think i have the java code virtually ready because for <unk> i wrote something very similar  
yes uh okay  
okay  
uh it's a colour  
well i'm not certain if high excitation should go in but if high excitation should go in i think <unk> means the same thing doesn't it  
mm-hmm  
we are they are still trying to use <unk> zap or those r. p. based approaches  
if when it's on yeah it's turned on  
<unk>  
on the m. m. m. yeah  
you <unk> your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted thought about voice control  
the glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed  
yeah  
um mm okay  
yeah  
i think that's a pretty handy feature  
well  
probably it's double curved  
oh no because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but  
but that's not terribly that's got no relationship to this  
yep yeah so i'll i'll have that running over the weekend  
i hope you don't like snakes do you  
and we seem to have least something in each criteria  
alright  
oh  
little bit slower  
um we are here at the conceptual design meeting which is hereby opened  
yeah  
but eve <unk> even someone would would provide very different labels like like someone would say it's a page in english  
yeah we are  
well it won't be visible  
i mean it's encoded in the in the image  
right  
great man  
i think continue like that  
um but uh i agree it's it's not a fancy high tech uh device  
smaller  
it keeps getting too big  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i would make a backlight of the l. c. d. screen with different colours  
um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that  
were they was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext or just avoiding both altogether  
just putting no excess buttons  
yeah yeah  
okay thanks  
mm 'kay  
just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two  
mm  
no  
we are very excited about that  
festival right  
uh  
maybe a nice touch yeah  
yeah okay  
hmm  
uh the paper was just for clean speech but since i had the results before and i cannot copy these things  
yeah  
why can't i  
so  
yeah  
a red apple  
ah okay  
yeah  
i think added lights are gonna be a problem too  
so um  
uh push button well  
yes  
um  
but it's more or less ready to go with that  
mm  
mm-hmm  
and probably you will have to run it  
yeah one  
yep  
yep  
any any volunteer  
hmm  
okay great  
<unk> certainly can be done yes  
yeah  
but if it just said em but if it just said emission line we would  
mm  
no it does because it was not temp one temp two but they have the same mm it has three g. b. three disks hard disk category  
i can uh look on my uh  
yeah  
it could yeah  
okay  
a compromise between what  
yeah and if you're not having a good time with the t. v. you can <unk> throw it about you know  
but then what colour would you make the r. <unk>  
is that the nebula  
yeah  
yeah  
you have to be very careful what you push  
or the the back  
and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra red bulb  
it's gotta be low cost or high cost with with special design features  
yeah  
so um yeah this time um i might not have them on the slides but i i can just mention them aw again  
i don't know uh i don't know if if it's it's necessary  
like uh some kind of rubber on it  
um for cost effectiveness we should really use a very low cost uh circuit board  
i wanna have a colour over here come on  
um  
yeah that's basically what it allows you to do right  
so that should that should make that slightly easier  
oh we probably have to get going don't we  
our interface options are push buttons  
okay that's me  
right  
but i <unk> i think from a speech recognition point of view it shouldn't matter these segments being whatever length that they happen to be  
remote <unk> rem remote t. v. control it's very has very <unk> sophisticated functions as we show from this picture  
mark the whole string as one entity  
so  
no way  
one thing you've gotta keep in mind keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time  
mm  
okay <unk>  
i'm i'm into it  
well you need some kind of c. p. u. i guess  
uh  
so  
yeah  
whether that'll be sort of two batteries four batteries um it may vary  
yeah  
but yeah  
so what are this mic for instance the <unk> mic  
so  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
never delete it  
brilliant  
okay it's a  
um tool training we're going to i guess figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles  
or just because you are going to design it on this board right  
well i'm well i'm well <unk> i've got the hang of all the stuff i've been going through  
day and a bit  
not necessarily because i mean the good think is <unk>  
they get lost a lot <unk> as it came up in our last meeting  
uh  
i think well we could <unk> <unk> do two or we could do one small lithium  
perl a perl script yeah  
if we use a scroll then we have the uh regular chip  
but um it's  
'kay but people tend to <unk> certain shapes to do certain things anyway don't they  
i want the uh i'd like nathan i'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel what can we accomplish  
mm-hmm  
you see i envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat  
well i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh <unk> functions  
oh right  
um and my question to all of you is should we look to other <unk> or should we just make do with what we have available  
interface  
it's looks like some mushroom so we call it mushroom design  
and even for kids as well  
yeah yeah  
mm 'kay um  
actually when you are watching the t. v. when you are watching anything or listening to them you hardly care about what is getting displayed here you know  
what you have is <unk> is you have is you have one clustering of marble which is this one  
yeah but then you can work together too when  
but are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue  
uh uh <unk> uh <unk> sorry uh  
i'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that i have  
be changed depending on budget  
i think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts  
um  
<unk> yes  
okay  
the wood  
i <unk> <unk> uh he was just using the fundamental frequency  
'cause are we gonna have some kind of tree view to represent the meetings and stuff  
yeah fewer buttons like i was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable  
yeah  
cool  
and this would be more for browsing ah  
the idea is to represent buttons as figures diagrams  
'kay  
right  
anyway sorry carry on  
it wouldn't be  
just long as it's some sort of non linear  
yeah  
yes  
mm  
so maybe do <unk> are we thinking something that like <unk> could sit in your hand comfortably or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or  
it might be useful to say like where are you remote  
i'll just attach it to an email  
yeah  
it will be red too  
okay any last  
thank you to you  
that's that's a yeah  
yeah th the best thing you can get uh on t. v. like getting information  
yeah i think that's a good idea  
yeah if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition  
we had play doh fun  
yeah  
so  
but i think maybe that one should be underlined  
ah ta da  
we can put what we want inside  
case  
for the case itself one colour  
but you've given people chance to say that if they really needed to  
so there we are again  
yeah  
yeah  
not for the left  
yes  
kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two piece  
should be in there  
<unk> what segments now  
mm  
um yeah back channels is what you <unk> typically would find although by and large these are gonna be silent  
<unk> right  
yeah  
mm  
oh sorry  
so  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this  
and who would like to start us off  
it is handy it's handy but it it's terrible  
okay  
sorry  
make our our our r. c. as trendy as possible but  
you know <unk> that's the weak point because with a traditional one you just have one hand  
or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it  
there is our remo the banana  
uh yeah i suppose if you know about eye trackers then you'll just know  
know five ten years  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but it it's expensive  
just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting  
the costs was that what you said  
someone would say it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a web page uh <unk> which has very few uh information in it or anything  
i hate these  
ah okay okay  
uh better quality  
yeah you could detect one word yeah  
detail design  
i th didn't think you could really tell  
uh this is a same <unk> they may do the grouping by themselves quite by looking at this it may take <unk> <unk> less one one minutes  
colour but have  
um  
they do that  
your project manager  
yeah  
now what  
one two three  
yeah  
uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand but it's it's still  
i think if you have a a speech recognition component then a <unk> speaking component is not that hard to to put in either  
okay and how about the battery power  
exactly  
it is <unk> spongy also  
the um should be <unk>  
well but yeah  
organic sponge  
um not a bis specific type of source but i think still the the <unk> feature <unk> counts even though it's <unk> a <unk> of something  
certain systems already exist i think  
yep  
but there were four points uh which uh i think are very important  
okay  
oh that's not gonna work  
so th the project is accepted  
ab  
otherwise you i don't know whether or not that's  
you know where  
'cause they can happen at the same time  
i'm right here i think  
yeah because even to download that much of data  
yeah but like we said before it has to be used on every television  
or at the top  
um and i guess that would require a more advanced circuit board so there is an extra price in that sense  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i mean maybe we have the <unk> um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then  
computer  
who's who's sort of doing the the the central coordination of of of the browser application now  
it's just there'll be a bunch of these  
that was like the number three thing  
and so you can go up to fourteen or something like that but it can be on the same yeah  
yeah yeah  
two three four five the whole up to <unk> ten they probably don't use those they only use the up and down channel  
fancy colours  
i would give it a seven  
yeah  
okay  
and um if you want to implement v. c. r. and d. v. d. options group them in the button not too uh  
for a curved well i was thinking to <unk> for to sit in your the palm of your hand  
sorry should i go back  
and and and and at as a second step you could infer some kind of rule about how to select <unk> with respect to the task  
maybe we can uh go through the different questions and then you can <unk> your own  
that's true  
yeah  
and let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear  
you're right there  
the segments are utterances aren't they  
okay  
'cause this definitely shouldn't be marked  
right  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
<unk> bruno did mention that he didn't want to be in a room with a lot of people 'cause he did that before and he didn't really like it  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
for monologues uh this is uh yeah  
yeah yeah and people can come <unk> in with their stuff or leave a newspaper or a magazine lying around for other people  
yeah <unk> is also worked for his be yeah  
um the dialogue act labels whether it's um um if they're annotated as agreement they're not zero here  
yes  
yeah  
yeah  
yes but it  
and uh  
so um it would be good to um <unk> right now i'm doing this  
um yeah just i just wanted to ask then before we wrap up  
we we tell the remote control what we want to do it sends a message to the television saying change the channel  
you want to have friends don't you  
there's <unk> yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control  
and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever  
see how far i get anyway  
it's better than for decoding it's better to play with them because they they are not zero anywhere you know  
but that's not import i think that's not <unk> very important because yeah it doesn't matter where the microphone is  
okay  
i don't for one  
so always like a  
but again because what i see is budget restrictions and limitations i don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing  
and then i have to prepare uh i have to defend our design so make it good  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
if it's a new trend  
um  
okay yeah  
actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight euros  
right um  
uh now  
how well it'll work yeah  
of course yeah you'll you'll never get the t. n. o. and d. f. k. i. stuff on it 'cause they're only billing stuff for the one to make the  
and use friendly yeah  
thank you  
even though but i already have i already have my code to build it up myself  
hmm  
yeah i didn't even think about adding slides  
sure  
um and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well i'd say  
do you think they'd notice if one went  
so um i so you say we haven't <unk> what the g. d. f. looks like  
and if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this i think for this audience we need absolutely the l. c. d. screen  
h. v. c. complexes  
as you all know you know <unk> my job is to design you know uh  
what where's it gonna sit in your living room  
um and finally there's more marketing i think um our corporate image has to be <unk>  
mm  
okay  
<unk> or something i i uh uh  
um  
like you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something and then the volume changes  
i suppose i suppose we can put um let's see  
yeah  
we're not under twelve euros and a half  
bird  
and it works  
a <unk> but in a sub sub menu or something like that  
so there's a there's the addendum and the and the co the existing construct  
yeah i don't thin i don't think there was <unk> but  
i've had three watches go that way too  
might be quite expensive to do that though  
okay  
so so the buttons the look and feel  
it wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype but that's because it's only two dimensions really  
as much as possible anyway  
it's uh it doesn't uh compile anymore on <unk> machines and yeah some maybe some work has to be done on this  
yeah it does look like a cat  
maybe there is some free ma machine that is not  
yeah i like to do it i like it it's nice et cetera  
sure  
oh okay  
so give them a <unk> yeah a week for the title and then they would have about ten days from then to actually get the abstract in  
my then other complication is two weeks tomorrow i start my teaching  
yeah it's probably because you <unk> i'm not sure if you have the version where the display yet  
is easy to use and see  
so is that the the final colour scheme as well or  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing  
if we can do with away with that our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say  
if you pressed and held it maybe  
but i think it does take a little bit of i mean uh i think sometimes maybe people need to be in linux rather than windows and so booting in and out  
so this is even more than the um  
yeah  
expensive  
three  
sorry  
<unk> usually chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar  
yeah  
you know maybe you <unk> of course okay people will say yeah  
uh but it's co actually compilation of uh really compilation of two classes i was giving at o. g. i. which is like speech processing and and uh perception  
did you press f. eight  
yeah  
so we try to only <unk> those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah sure  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> so when you speak speech is wide band  
the basic principle of  
alright so this is the end of the first meeting  
well but that's also useful for the evaluation  
so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual  
again this to have some interaction like suppose people use d. s. p. then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form  
that is a source name you're right  
so  
ah someone is talking about me let's listen  
yeah that's gonna be up to these guys  
um so do we want to do the presentation first or do we want to um  
okay  
um we we don't want today to to put deadlines you know  
mm  
misses  
okay  
yeah  
i think so  
which is doubly important to the third one so just to take that weight into account  
yeah  
that's some wrong info man  
yeah  
so yeah  
uh you can make a if you make a drawing  
no problem  
in fact um i just explain how to put the data on m. m. m. but it's quite simple  
<unk>  
yeah <unk> this might be  
um you open it up there's a circuit board inside um and there's a a chip  
if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant  
yeah  
no  
a cat  
although it needs some light doesn't it  
it's yeah  
this'll just take a moment  
so um i would for example need the um most <unk> um frequent words  
yeah <unk> i think that l. c. d. screen should be like  
<unk> there's two sort of statutes of professor  
yeah  
i would first <unk>  
mm-hmm  
are we getting i  
even then our product is going to be very good  
yeah i got it at my home like  
okay  
a mi uh possible problem but if you drop it yeah  
i figured well that's <unk> kinda high tech when when you have a remote control that well when you pick it up it has power  
so we're looking to sell internationally not just in europe  
still i'll do without that  
so  
oh well  
mm-hmm  
well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose <unk> with the t. v. screen uh uh with just four buttons  
you could have a <unk> even a little image of you know the <unk> you know the the <unk> the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading  
so we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
a lot of buttons they may think from i don't need <unk> as much as that  
what are you <unk> or  
i it just helps you know which theory you should be concentrating on  
yep  
i mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit  
that this that does not look like a dog  
yeah  
um you are industrial you are user interface  
but we're supposed to say <unk>  
save as  
um so you can compare that  
yeah  
yeah  
cool  
really  
we have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button  
the the the well the i meant the product  
so  
so the first one uh stylish look and feel  
oh yeah still have 'em  
but so yes dependable and have a good medium range size  
tho tho those new d. v. d. players on the market do have those  
mm  
yeah that's right  
so basically i'll start off by uh i thought i'll use the <unk> because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are <unk> or highlighting or underlining them or something like that  
that's that's the pro so uh uh it will be generated  
yeah  
uh <unk>  
well i guess you uh get the idea  
yep  
um  
oh  
yes  
okay sure  
seven is the  
'cause uh for information if we uh somebody's uh seeking some information then he uh ask some question and uh the one knows will uh gives gives the answer  
okay  
yeah that's great for us  
and and don't use it when the utterance is clearly continued in the next segment or whatever  
i would say you might use these measures in a simple way if you do it uh on line  
it's on but there's nothing on the screen  
mm-hmm  
<unk> what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device  
okay well since this one's up keep this one in  
yeah  
and oh  
very nice  
yeah the they are big and clear  
yeah  
but uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself  
okay okay okay  
the female shape yeah  
cool  
no  
okay  
we we could we could do um a double curved rubber one which would allow um say a banana  
paint spray  
um with a with a regular chip  
'cause meetings is a lit different from normal text or a <unk> a normal dialogue or monologue  
and the base station might not be necessary  
yeah simple 'cause we've just got push buttons so we can do it all with simple which is the <unk> should be the cheapest  
yeah so you can program the  
no that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look  
so  
so if you have for each word say and we know that word starts at this segment and ends at that segment  
leopard print or something  
yeah  
during lunch yeah  
so the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones  
ah  
i mean everybody everybody knows how to use that  
organic and i think would look rather co i mean mi rather cool  
okay what else  
it's too  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah well the led on the corner that that indicates that it's working  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
if we if we do it this way like we <unk> we have to discuss that if we do it this way  
yeah  
ah it's it's it's it's coming up actually  
it's like antennas  
yeah but t. v. <unk> aren't capable of sending  
that's why i uh  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
uh  
but then as i knew the tempo that i had to be on the second time i think i did a bit better  
f. eight <unk>  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
the noise for when you lose the banana um <unk> yeah  
but it's probably yeah you probably have to work on word levels for importance  
mm  
any trends that are going on in in the public even media you know who's famous  
okay very cool  
and well i still believe you should keep displaying the buttons  
and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go i dunno why  
but  
so uh i'll uh remind myself to look at what's next before the next time we get together  
okay  
so a lot of unused buttons  
and this is no no no  
and not with a stereo i think it should be good to include functions for v. c. r. <unk> and d. v. d. players recorders  
yeah  
are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the <unk> like it it the fashions apply to furniture  
okay  
oh yeah yeah  
however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l. c. d. which has been kind of put forward so far it's almost like having a small  
well i think it's you got it just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling  
yeah alright yeah fair enough  
yeah  
uh anyway  
yeah our company is very uh  
but but you you are <unk>  
hmm  
so if if anybody looks into that then let me know  
no  
uh yeah  
yeah right isn't that the skimming  
it's actually shut down  
hmm  
why does  
yes alright  
okay our agenda today um just check the time it's twelve thirteen  
next slide  
nope  
yeah  
regular chip  
sure  
i'll have a look through some of my java books 'cause it might be the sort of thing they have in there  
and that it should look different than what's out there  
yeah  
two's not very high at all though  
yeah <unk> you gotta zap like this or you want to yeah  
mm  
line in the spectrum is it  
but um the lack of the feeling i already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion  
by the perhaps you can save this one and then copy or something  
that basically measure the hypothesis that some way the probability of having one word in correspondence of a certain slide is simply the product of the probability of the word for the probability of the  
uh  
oh yeah  
uh what do you mean by case  
hmm  
mm  
so if anybody gets any good samples of that never  
or i didn't have g. s. m. in the u. s.  
and we could use illuminated buttons which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone or um something <unk> familiar  
alright  
right  
but it's not really it's by no means uh  
i would have to look at it <unk> and because be before i <unk> before i we could <unk> we could write anything i i would be have to be sure that something is right there  
so what's the range  
so you all know what the parts of the work you have to do  
'cause you can  
for the l. c. d. screen  
uh just general findings  
well i kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it then maybe we should have it for the whole thing  
i think  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah that that that that's what that's what that's the way he's working the moment  
or  
i see my bunny is still standing  
mm-hmm  
again  
let's do the look and feel design presentation first  
yes okay  
yeah <unk> a lemon lemon or something  
uh like uh for your mobile phone  
no when you make it large enough no it it will not  
the the front view side view and the back view  
well it should be possible  
so we there's gonna be a way to sooner or later to align the eye track <unk> one <unk> two with two sound channels  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah think so  
and do we do we have a  
but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice  
but if you're watching t. v. for two hours you don't want your t. v. to turn off after five five minute  
good  
on the screen you mean  
speech recognition  
it it would have to be re calculated only for my segments  
well uh just say stick 'em in anyway  
have to get up  
it's a bit uh large  
mm-hmm  
i mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um  
uh  
i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually  
it's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty just to be actually serious for a minute here you could  
can this can this <unk> reach  
i can try to do it and send it to you  
mm-hmm  
four <unk> that's forty <unk>  
hmm  
um  
okay  
so that's false  
if it was heated um everything would spring apart  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
but um  
um so that that's something that's quite common in the transcriptions that i've looked at  
yes definitely i'm very sad that i didn't get any links to the corporate website  
'kay  
thanks  
mm-hmm  
but yeah at <unk> at least it was speed restrictions instead of like trains flying past into barriers and things  
mm  
okay so if joystick and l. c. d.  
and you can understand pretty well  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
the the the other thing you could do is have is just fill in the reply to address as p. g. c. depending on what you wanna do  
uh this is the agenda the opening  
mm  
this is this this isn't a leading question  
i think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere  
yeah  
i don't know  
uh ditto for volume selection so ten out of ten  
like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the <unk> on the coach  
so that's that one  
mm-hmm  
consider the <unk>  
hmm  
so  
yeah it's a good option  
i kinda miss the docking station  
<unk>  
yeah where are going to where are you are you going to place them  
uh whatever makes it easiest for you to do  
okay  
yeah uh well and as you saw we would just have the basic remote with the panel l. c. d. uh screen  
right okay  
mm-hmm  
well i'm not very good at drawing but i will uh go first  
i'm about to end yeah  
whereas like the pitch estimation in in the x. waves or these things they're all dynamic programming based on again l. p. c. analysis  
yeah  
yeah  
for each for each one  
like you might expect to have to extend the theory to do that  
so again i don't know  
also and uh uh the remote is lost  
should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in <unk> within budget we should celebrate  
the phone that uh cohen yeah voice signals  
did we <unk> what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before  
'kay  
i'll get rid of the bear  
yeah  
no no screens it's too complex  
but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons  
yeah  
yeah i understand you i can talk a little bit dutch  
so the only option is an hand dynamo  
so  
see 'cause i'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make  
it's twelve frames zero seconds  
one two three four et cetera  
that's the buttons only refer to the pad so  
i've seen some remotes do that  
so i have this  
so it doesn't make any sense  
yeah  
it's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing but i guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh  
so turning channel of course  
i mean when you came it was just like <unk> one of the craziest uh uh times of this year  
uh i mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case doesn't matter  
well if you save uh perhaps uh <unk> tiny buttons aren't user friendly then we wouldn't <unk> implement that of course  
no it shouldn't 'cause it it modifies the ratios  
between the master and the slave we have um the mm a <unk> signal which is call time midi time code  
but if you have a regular chip you can't have the l. c. d. screen  
some creative uh  
absorption line systems shouldn't be there  
oh yeah sure  
mm  
yeah they could be plastic  
so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like  
um  
th then you'll see it on the television  
huh  
mm-hmm  
and when it's big and plastic it's like some fun stuff you can always have around  
hmm  
well i'm mike user interface designer  
oh yeah  
i know  
five  
if if they  
they both mean the same thing  
so let's go to the industrial designer  
the the ticker the l. c. d. is like like small  
no kinetic energy no solar  
i don't know exactly how sort of <unk> i mean  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's good question  
we should yeah that would save us one though we'd still be slightly <unk>  
maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting  
are we adding one of these  
okay  
along the side uh strip of yeah  
i think that's not very  
yeah  
so um why don't um do each of you have a presentation  
okay so you basically achieve that by giving less space to the reading room i think  
yeah  
okay it's my part  
okay yeah  
so even i i think even <unk> uh he can find less than twenty millisecond windows also especially for <unk> uh  
yeah  
yeah i kept it global 'cause that it activates or <unk> specific functions 'cause i wasn't thinking yet about that  
but the more advanced functions are probably  
alright  
mm-hmm  
and we have yeah  
mm  
okay for example if you put the screen here it's more about the functions now than the than the layout  
damped lyman <unk> again  
hmm  
yeah just on the the <unk> um the l. c. d. display  
yeah well  
but when you got a l. c. d. screen with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place  
hmm  
i think all of that goes then doesn't it  
my personal preference is i'll just throw my cards on the table uh i think we should probably go the solar battery route  
okay fruits  
oh yeah  
yeah  
um in order to make a profit of this magnitude we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro  
so if you're left handed you're kind of left uh <unk> with your finger  
of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something  
okay  
you're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that and especially 'cause then you could make it something that  
so it's uh the easy one  
but i think that um we don't you know there will be some meeting browser demo that um  
i you you could just listen to the speech segments again and make sure everything is correct for those and so you could just hit um  
because we are going to look at the finance and i have a nice excel sheet to do that  
any ideas  
no no way  
mm  
what you need is something well no because you need to  
i don't  
colour a the colours are special the form is special  
for us there was a lot of creativity  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
push buttons  
well <unk> which is probably a documentation fault right  
uh yeah but then you have to store the whole matrix and plus some extra information what is tied to what or <unk>  
yeah <unk>  
uh yeah it's good as well  
you have mm something else to say  
so maybe that would be something separate yeah  
is that gonna push us over our production costs  
so  
there we go  
um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain  
well did you say uh who said  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
there is a huge market  
yep  
we might um yeah need a more strict or finer uh definition of interactivity  
yes uh-huh  
for <unk> for that <unk> type of situation  
the remote control has irrelevant or less used functions  
okay  
mm  
mm-hmm  
is that okay for you  
so okay  
that's the way i interpreted it anyway softness in materials shape and function  
because j. p. <unk> question the overriding question is so what's language for  
you want to start  
alright  
okay  
the alternative is to have a an on screen display on your television that you control through your remote control  
and well what about the idea of automatic on off on the button yeah  
you have to do it over  
well there's our five minutes uh warning  
yeah  
is it still the old old t. f. i. d. f.  
we don't even have uh speakers here  
yeah  
yeah  
that that's all  
yeah  
no  
that's uh important  
yeah so  
yeah  
i think i'm do i think i'm working out who's top and bottom  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
and it it's al also it's not very clear because <unk> and <unk> are well  
with all all si all sort of colours and <unk> kind of <unk> of uh of fronts like we can use on the telephone and it  
like if you have  
maybe liz or whoever comes over next time  
yeah so it's different but still uh yeah it's same  
obviously something small that's yeah that's a good point  
you just need to take the error of <unk> uh residual of this full window and then residual of energy of the sub windows and then you can just divide them and then the only thing is like again he has to use some threshold to decide  
so i'll read that into um i'll make it part of the get measure thing  
yes this is a special colour  
and we're converging on having one now just in in sort of tandem with this development of this web based <unk>  
yeah if they can decode at least <unk> p. files then <unk> can  
okay  
you can make the the underside you can make it more round where the l. c. d. is  
and uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons  
presentation  
ah okay  
or  
as far as i know  
yeah <unk> uh maybe not not all that fancy but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh <unk> <unk> the profits and um  
three  
not on the control but on the screen  
yeah  
we have a menu button and  
combine them  
so they have to be waterproof maybe  
okay  
mm  
no yeah well oh six  
because otherwise i will already open it  
but the problem then is that it will start to resemble <unk> the remote controls as we have them today  
i think you're right there as well  
you can  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly thoroughly  
yeah  
so what do we think if you have a fairly hectic week are we looking for subjects next week  
yeah  
we're up to the point of the  
mm  
yeah  
definitely  
latex covers  
again  
yeah  
<unk> colours  
yeah  
mm  
uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply  
not too much  
basis station is with the thing  
yeah  
it is uh curved easy to hold hand held nice and small with big easy buttons  
hmm  
seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot  
mm-hmm  
lapel  
it's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes  
i think especially if we're gonna <unk> have an l. c. d. screen on a low range product then that's good  
no i haven't said anything yet  
but th the younger people my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy and uh  
right  
or  
ah okay  
this is this kind of signal that the th bus manager is sending  
we just put some simple button in make it big and sturdy nothing more and just make <unk> sure there's some noise that it can make  
because same <unk> yeah different uh application different uh different software or something  
and you  
not down  
uh why  
if um that would be a good idea or not  
you know  
good  
oh okay i understand i understand  
oh yeah you had one of the in between ones when they weren't doing that anymore  
that's why it's real time like otherwise it's bit difficult and it's okay you can easily understand so it's intelligible so  
okay  
yeah it's hard to know what that is  
i will <unk> yeah  
are we talking three times more expensive  
yeah  
so i if i change this it will go there if i change that will go there  
but maybe then both groups won't buy it  
or at least it should look like it  
and the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so  
then the next uh local minimum and uh taking this uh this range doing average on it  
you know i thought of that actually  
then the all the scripts are there in the temp file that kind of thing  
who was responsible for what  
yeah yes i thought about something like that  
so <unk> we can just yeah we can just run it quickly and see  
alright then  
um can you draft craig in to build some if necessary  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah when you have an <unk> like last time what what should you say it's it's yeah it's a change of  
no no no no no  
i didn't know it exist but that's great  
yeah  
so either  
that's <unk> that's difficult  
whatever  
yep  
okay sure  
but but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push buttons  
that was a bit of a distraction  
never mind  
no no no  
what's uh the the th th project is is here to do is is to to get this this project up and moving  
now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid  
good plan  
star burst contribution  
alright  
yeah yeah  
okay  
and the video also or not uh  
no no no no no  
oh like say if you could make a um change to your thing so it could display uh like it in two halves  
sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties  
hmm  
but  
ca <unk> we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty  
so again we know what to more or less we know what to do with the hilbert envelope  
um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design the user interface design and we're gonna evaluate the product  
okay whatever  
okay  
okay  
we're gonna get to know each other a little bit better  
it's um i think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside  
now if we look back at this graph we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent  
um  
couldn't we have like one that comes out  
the eye track is a dynamic object  
actually <unk> <unk> when you wrote regular chip you should put two because there is another chip here  
what  
oh  
mm  
uh with same shape but not the same shape and colour  
uh let me see  
check out  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so  
ah okay okay  
and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here it blocks it  
um  
or  
so i just  
yeah a two  
so i mean maybe <unk> i mean ideally i suppose we'll meet again here  
um the reason i'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control  
i wanna hear from you what you've done  
no we have but i not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous  
we're making a remote with with a few functions you know  
uh but uh uh number uh well the uh duration time as well somehow  
so basically uh what i suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control  
so and probably  
yeah three quarter of the of the  
so even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros  
so okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery  
you need the phase  
oh  
what should it look like  
yeah  
which which uh colour should the buttons be  
um i don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls particularly sort of independent ones  
this <unk> entire bottom  
thing  
and you wanna get  
yeah yeah  
uh oh  
yeah  
so mm in terms of time what we can think  
yeah  
all of them of course  
i did not knew that  
it's already changed for  
hmm  
piranha  
it was four months  
<unk>  
what what are they  
but  
i just i know that like if you don't do it with the exceptions crashes  
i think 'cause the meetings were so regular you know  
'kay  
so we can implement it  
and the second one is really uh state of the art uh in terms of innovation  
i don't know  
no wood's not an option  
so um we have that decision sort of made for us  
unless do you guys wanna evaluate both  
physically uh yeah  
the third one is call uh the third one is uh the project that i have to improve the current smart meeting room at <unk>  
right  
oh the white board marker has a camera as well  
'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life so no  
i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs  
mm  
just general english textbook i i cho i tried  
yeah but that depends on where you put the screen  
well you <unk> you have to keep in mind that uh several t. v. <unk> uh don't even have a menu structure or they have a very simple menu structure  
i mean remote controls can be thin bits  
yeah  
so there's a right but i think weak line should be in  
well everybody already has his presentation so you can adjust it  
okay  
well no no  
so essentially they <unk> never took into account i mean the work at the high level which means basically we have the information coming from here and there  
red red blue and green you give them or something and then you can give them uh other ones  
like one thing is like we can do this begin and end detection as we said  
so if you read that then it then you know that there are no errors and  
yeah we <unk> could we only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing  
oh yeah we can do buttons  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
right  
so if you have no time to put priority at some points and this seems to have been the case during one year on this project  
um  
and how did you feel about the whole the whole process though  
and that's  
this  
maybe uh you've got new information like uh last time  
but those <unk> will be same as uh <unk> <unk> scale <unk> right  
yeah yeah yeah  
f. what is it  
okay so more time during the individual work phases  
okay  
mine just crashed i think which is bad  
yeah  
yeah i was happy to be back in suisse after few few days it's better to be here i think  
yes  
just a beep  
um that was your presentation  
yeah  
yeah and and some of our d. v. d. players incidentally have them because we have the relationship with our own department but moreover we need to  
yeah  
that's not necessary because it you can take this away but there it looks like there's a hole there just to mirror the effect  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is  
just that ones  
yeah that's true  
you can <unk> get them printed as you want to so <unk> we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost the way we want to have  
yeah i think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included  
no no no no i say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that  
yeah so that has implications though for the  
florence resolved it by  
the <unk> the <unk> the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly  
okay  
so right window is should end at twelve point two so you're to search basically in this range  
a little bit too big i think  
maybe maybe we can hassle the the  
and the l. c. d. you have to see it  
well there are loads of different types of dogs so i'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog  
yeah  
so what do we think maybe we should pedro do you have any opinion on it  
f. five  
um research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features  
then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising  
still it's still hard  
you just got a message  
uh it's not the colour so maybe you should make two but it has r. and r.  
dunno  
i dunno it will be round about one or two percent  
and we thought i we have much more time  
<unk>  
there there are three uh components three components type  
yeah okay  
and they used them very infrequently a as well  
something like that yeah  
thank you  
and you  
right  
oh okay  
and then there's the language stuff as well presumably  
i think we are great  
right okay  
either two or one maybe  
but um it it's not making any sound uh have we deciding  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
d. v. d. <unk> and v. c. r.  
yeah don't store <unk> anything sensitive on yeah don't store anything you you care about on the machines  
i think  
that that means that any bugs that need fixed are now craig's responsibility right  
sorry what what happened now  
and maybe not such a prominent way  
i see a dog in there  
so basically the only new thing is the l. c. d. on the remote now  
i don't want to make it economically uh <unk> uh competitive  
yes  
thank you sarah  
mm-hmm  
the <unk> yeah  
i don't know with who you are discussing about the time you are you can <unk> uh <unk> spend on each of the project  
it does sampling out of the  
then it's  
yeah true  
yeah uh um only in the curves  
you already uh opened uh <unk>  
you're you're thinking about yeah  
okay  
that's what we kind of predicted anyway  
probably you should start i think  
yeah i mean so we've dropped the cost but  
easy to use  
i mean you might find ninety eight percent of your data is directly referring to your slides in a <unk> in a tam  
yes  
mm  
yeah that's pretty good  
then that's the end of this meeting  
so now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality potentially that we can handle  
you know if we have a high tech interior then then that that <unk> may well be cost effective  
but i would like to say uh there is many unknown in that project  
we couldn't put maggie and bruno together  
it's for one t. v. oh right okay sure  
good  
let's let's try to <unk> rub off things and yeah so um hand <unk> are definitely out right  
is it can you hold that or  
have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on  
and we'll the the way we've uh we are doing it is kind of i think it works but it's little bit <unk>  
so it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account  
no i don't <unk> know it no  
and the whole thing  
yeah no <unk> why to keep <unk> variability in the length of the frames  
yes you're right  
this is what we decided  
okay  
um yeah  
i'll give it a one  
hmm  
my little brother goes there  
consider that  
the speaker  
so you don't have to i think you don't have to make entire remote controls  
yeah i think user interface is fairly obvious  
okay  
i don't think there was anything  
'cause only one's <unk> to the clock or it <unk> and the others are all absolute real time aren't they  
mm  
ah i i i think five  
so we don't have the the sound and it won't be grabbed the video won't uh i don't know if uh  
but um but it loo it looks like it was doing all the calibration and drift correction things that <unk> ellen was wanting on it  
so  
yeah  
for special navigation for example you might have a t. v. in the menu and you going to change yeah  
okay  
okay  
yeah it's still bob morris  
the the logo and everything  
i dunno  
hmm  
i also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for  
one or two  
this is the parameters of the of the c. programme but uh usage  
right  
um well the developments  
they are high high interested in feature  
uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one  
alright <unk>  
special for  
i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for  
i think it should be at the button bottom  
but  
uh i th i thought the the with less buttons you can make a more <unk> uh yeah more <unk> design i think  
mm mm  
because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home and  
perhaps it could be like a temporary  
well maybe it's good to do it anyway because if we evaluate it we we can also determine if our objectives are good  
uh  
or no scroll uh things  
this is the functional design meeting  
oh sorry yeah um mm  
uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing  
nice  
<unk> too much  
yes  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
i figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it  
but what do most people do  
so they do need to be in the  
yeah  
i think it'll get everything done i think it might be a little confusing at first um i don't know if that's gonna be a later one  
if someone puts up i uh picks up his remote and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel  
sure  
um for someone who's sort of <unk> the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting  
finish meeting  
but that might be broken  
you wait your search what would it return  
and the casing is plastic  
yeah  
maybe it's a good thing  
uh forty th four  
so it's  
so it's a cat  
mm  
aurora task  
yeah  
but yeah  
uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it  
i suppose  
but um they do <unk>  
also so you have uh uh browsing the channels actually so you can go up and down the channels  
how do you feel because your office well three persons and you are all full time in there so you with nancy and maria  
well  
yeah  
infrared galaxies  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no no  
that's really that's really your so any general impression or feedback  
i like that it stands up  
it should work so you can  
because even um petr has lost a lot  
but we start with the i. v. c.  
it's a necessary evil  
i would give it um well because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at  
hmm  
and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true  
so that we can that we can treat it with the same algorithm or  
mm-hmm  
no the leadership was okay  
and  
yeah presumably  
um one problem i used to have is with all the <unk>  
mm  
uh  
and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that  
and the marketing person that's courtney is going to do the user requirements specification  
okay  
yeah yeah about yeah like yeah a bit like radio <unk>  
the gaze will wobble  
like we're looking at atlas you'd expect to score quite high  
uh  
i agree  
<unk>  
well that's a just simple <unk> mock up i want to <unk> make it more as dynamic for you so i'll draw there  
i don't wanna do like three like three internal time scales so that's just getting messy  
as number of branches  
so we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do  
no  
if necessary  
<unk>  
yeah  
so i would say from location at the lower level you can get small parts of speech and then at the next level  
so it can be one more feature that helps in but it is very short term  
completely <unk> together and it it it you know total reliability but i mean i <unk> i i uh  
so uh but i think  
it is  
aye cheers  
i closed the  
yeah  
yeah okay  
if you are able to calibrate your microphones um the ones who are closer to the person will get more energy  
maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand  
boss  
did you guys uh get that one down  
yeah  
yeah  
i agree  
well i shall go to the next slide  
yep  
but then you have still another part sometime something like a source and a filter  
and they require that the uh actually i'll get to that at the end point number four  
oh you can  
okay so yeah so we have those and and then we have some <unk> field somewhere else which has  
my favourite animal is  
a lack of absorption you would put it in because we said we would put describing words  
hmm  
see a po three  
to the whole thing as well so that you know that it's working basically  
oh that's true  
do you know  
for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design  
so push or scroll right  
yeah  
and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work  
right  
it's done  
okay and then  
if it's if it if the banana is big enough  
yeah  
and if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often  
did uh did you like that one  
okay can i um i'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here  
ah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
a nice one  
yeah  
nah  
so we ha we have the computer we have the the main box with the eight line ins  
so we  
yeah  
yeah  
think then we're hitting our cost issue again  
hmm  
because i'll have some updated info on that uh  
yeah  
yeah it  
yeah  
yeah yeah <unk> yeah yeah  
so it's again compression factor something like th and but then you have to <unk> it again of course to get back the speech  
smart board  
so how how many person days would it be worth like if craig discovered it could be done in x. days  
they know her et cetera  
yeah that's right  
yeah  
how many colours are we gonna give it  
that's a real reaction remote control i want one of those  
oh oh no  
it feels a bit more comfortable and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber  
yeah  
right  
yeah  
so  
we'll go into that a bit more but please go on  
mm  
we also do that  
we should use  
yeah  
as in the new high tech  
okay so  
yeah  
mm yeah  
they ca they can appear without them  
if so we can proceed if not we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit  
okay  
yeah  
one possibility  
yeah  
okay  
um so <unk> those would be the ones you would focus on first obviously  
okay  
mm  
uh when we are and when <unk> you are uh going to design <unk> uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five euros  
uh we have two groups young and trendy and the old and rich  
i mean i th i mean i think to <unk> retaining the <unk> the more sort of <unk> <unk> form in the articulation would gain more in <unk> uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh  
why do i have to do the difficult tasks  
no i don't think so  
yeah it may um yeah and <unk> try to <unk> write your name uh in a in a normal uh size yeah  
well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do you could have uh a you know a um uh kind of a natural wood colour  
ah okay  
okay  
uh so th uh we uh d. f. k. i. 'cause they're working on some h. p. s. g. parsing  
okay  
okay well just to finish up should we <unk> go with this plan start making some  
yeah true but yeah we have we have the zoom option right  
um i'm don't know how long the break will be but we'll find out  
there's a sort of just a research report sort of basis for this  
and then we'll close again  
yes  
oh  
yeah  
yeah for example  
we're <unk> we we're looking at who buys it as well  
and so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option  
uh uh the next statement  
ouch  
where would the light come from  
that i don't have access to because i didn't download like there's this one meta information file where it describes the structure of all the files and describes which um which attributes they bring in  
everybody's searching in his data  
there is another problem for uh verifying these results because well for these results you know  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh remote control sends one signal at one button uh press  
so you know <unk> something like that  
right uh-huh  
i am  
last presentation  
given that it is the galaxy  
kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking  
um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting  
eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy  
that's a ne i it it's a new technology but it's not incorporated right now  
yeah and it'd help if you drop it it protects it as well  
so you need <unk> special t. v. sets to do that  
it seems to be good yeah  
very annoying  
'cause you've had like the most typing and <unk> to do  
yeah  
okay functional requirements  
um  
and after it would generate automatically some index and uh as a i suppose the client might be interested in such a such a things if he could uh generate automatically on the d. v. d.  
um uh first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some of the things i did  
yeah  
switch to another category of functions  
because  
yeah  
right  
i'm going to um steal a cable  
because like we we <unk> how much we can copy because it's really so many <unk> and even we thought of really completing minimal experiment also mm  
oh  
a combination yeah  
um yeah so des uh design a new remote control  
i just remembered one  
sorry i was just i'll just uh resume something else i was gonna say  
mm-hmm  
not embed  
and then uh because of the <unk> because children are using the device so we have also a a of t. v. <unk> by genre  
and uh yeah  
but uh  
i when i'm when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod that's how i do it hold it and press the four  
but since you are in a different domain this is he here we are in time domain right  
so do we have other concepts  
mm-hmm  
but the actual theoretical um or <unk> of it was incredibly complex  
yeah  
what we should what the decision we should take yeah  
sorry sorry  
or putting his bag on the okay  
but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where i'd be inclined to go back to upper level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here  
um we decided that it should probably be one handed  
lovely  
it has t. v. has like information it has information on holidays the news entertainment  
and also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy  
i think i would  
so push buttons we will use  
okay  
the size of the  
okay  
yeah yeah  
<unk>  
uh-huh  
right  
well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's well this would be in the middle  
if yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken  
um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh i dunno  
find out what's next  
mm-hmm  
but if you just present the functionality of the thing if you're not like i don't think this presentation is about the internal working  
on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well i think l. c. d. will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results  
so i'll put it i'll put them there as soon as i've written them  
we're going to produce it in uh china so it's no problem  
and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings  
can i have channel five  
the colour being yellow  
i mean that that's also a good idea  
mm-hmm  
enter power as a <unk> oh um a sum simultaneous key  
and the shape was so symmetrical that i'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button  
mm-hmm  
of course yellow  
but you wouldn't have a file open dialogue box for that then  
<unk> uh projector  
it's very lovely  
but uh uh scroll for a channel <unk> selection or volume  
yeah  
or we are going to discuss something  
well  
yeah 'cause that will <unk> help narrow down the choice of  
it's gonna be hard  
yeah  
so we come up with two versions  
mm-hmm  
didn't we  
it only had a <unk> a a <unk> usage frequency of about one times per hour but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance  
yeah yeah yeah  
that's a good idea  
now i have all about circuits and chips and transponders and i wrote it all down because i thought it would be relevant  
and yours was called interface concept  
yep  
um well we are going to calculate the production costs  
so it will come up  
so <unk> the other part is to have a system which from which we can already record data and with some approximation  
yeah that's better  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
in some aspects it is like we said  
because i think it will uh it must be uh  
and um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much  
so you are  
i think i think that's a <unk> nice clean design it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology  
the mobiles get lost all the time  
awesome  
but i think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television  
if you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or  
so why don't you still use it  
oh yeah  
as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case it has a consistency of those stress balls  
for being strong and sturdy  
so they don't match but the clustering is still very good in in one respect  
uh there we go just screw 'em on in  
and uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are  
which i which was more or less t. n. o.  
it seems to be  
and you are  
yeah it would  
yeah  
would we wanna show it off to our friends  
yeah that'll do  
it's okay i think  
so i think it's probably worth i don't think we're gonna get inundated with requests  
yep  
do you want it straight flowing  
yeah  
so we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it  
okay  
yeah yeah yeah it's i think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the <unk> um on the same module but uh  
yeah but  
i mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing  
yes is that pretty much  
about the about what  
hmm  
no  
no way  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
<unk> twelve or twenty <unk> functions of a remote t. v. control  
okay  
uh it's very innovative  
mm  
requirements part  
yeah that doesn't go in  
um  
and four of the buttons are in the wheel and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel yeah  
yes  
yes  
okay  
on any hand  
finish meeting now  
oh we all leave  
and if you get the number in wrong then it's a bit of a pain so i think  
so you <unk> this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we <unk> more on the graphical user interface here  
um but we have to take care like  
was it a nice way to create your remote control  
uh uh what i'm i'm thinking is if you've got say one object there and right  
i think channel selection would be annoying because it just <unk> you could scroll past the channel or  
um just  
no  
mm-hmm  
yeah but sure  
where you um have got <unk> buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something  
yeah it's right yeah that's right  
is that  
yeah  
i guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee  
the next item is evaluation  
yeah and they're  
so who has any idea about what should be on it and what shouldn't  
i just for preparing this uh nice discussion  
okay  
yeah yeah you <unk> just only like recent p. files at least  
sure  
yeah  
well it depends when you say functional do you mean it does what we want it to do  
mm  
uh then you push a button  
and you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things  
we can uh take notes and uh  
say december two thousand six  
take plus or minus two or three or five or ten words doesn't really make any difference  
yeah  
yeah it was so that was without the l. c. d.  
manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but i  
what  
right  
they're they're critical the to the success of a project  
yeah  
so my mush  
great  
'cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through  
let's see here  
that's where you  
so it <unk> falls over the hand  
and so that stays the same when you have the logo and then you have this <unk> slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes  
mm-hmm  
or do you think it uh  
mm-hmm  
so i'll just bring that up and show you all  
so but  
yeah  
so then it's already shaken and gives energy  
there you go  
and please forget the drawing skills of these guys  
well uh you two are going to work together  
oh  
that's the first aspect  
so that this doesn't apply  
yeah v. l. b. i. is uh a net uh it's it's a v. l. b. i. is it's a technique  
anyways  
sure  
no no  
yeah  
did you do your questionnaire already  
mm  
a and uh not to yell at it from the distance  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
for buttons  
and uh and but now it seems like that is since since what we are doing here we are normal l. p. c. is fitting uh peaks right  
and we don't know what this is then that page is more likely to be good  
project manager what do you think  
now we have courtney with the functional requirements  
i'll have to find that out  
that's it's it's good to have that  
yeah it's always black or yeah  
at least two reports from marius seem to me  
no they that actually saves you hours trying to make somebody's data smooth out when it won't  
hmm  
and also for the mouse uh for the volume it's also uh easy to use  
well  
yeah the logo uh uh it's difficult to draw so small but it's our double r. uh logo is in there  
i knew things uh were going uh too smoothly  
no but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably i mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install  
but uh so the practical actions you know what are the things we're gonna go away and do  
oh yeah  
so i just look at some current designs uh on the web of usually more complicated remote controls  
so the three of you and let's see <unk> um myself and <unk>  
it's not terribly interesting though really  
ready  
uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative  
i th i uh <unk>  
uh current chan  
don't see it  
do you think  
um  
yeah  
then i think it's a good thing that i made a separate slide of them so you can  
up  
without l. c. d.  
so i don't think that's a really good the other alternative were solar cells  
i mean you might see it as the initial g. d. f. is just whatever straight <unk> translates without  
but again he assumes some initial uh sizes for these windows  
and in uh immediately a <unk> a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened  
exactly  
the presentation is still open  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
but  
yeah  
so basically what we can do is <unk> make these edges a little bit less sharp  
um because you can also interpolate the pitch information from the the spectrum as well  
and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control because it yeah it makes sense  
um <unk> would you like to i'll just do it from here  
yeah  
swahili  
and then it yes  
it's simply not true  
yeah two colours it  
'cause i think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user  
um i've sorted out uh travel et cetera to munich for <unk> for ellen john and myself  
and it yeah l. l. c. d.  
so i guess that isn't an option  
okay  
and  
i <unk>  
mm  
and then if you have the archive of a journal you can you can use the <unk> the links between uh the citation links  
a a lot of people are uh if you have the l. c. d. screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure i mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user  
and then we should get another pair who are naive to the whole thing  
mm-hmm  
mm  
it's i'm <unk> it's probably easy to dumb down the h. p. s. g. parse too  
yeah  
uh but then i do think we need to discuss the speech  
and i think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users  
and what about the sort of innovation  
um we're gonna do a little tool training so we are gonna work with that <unk> behind you  
we have to skip it  
nothing else to add  
it's a fat cat  
yeah isn't it fashionable  
you shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere  
so if you could compress it and just put it into a temp directory  
hmm  
no so it's a text file <unk> in the project folder  
it's already open  
keyboard type shape you know like video games <unk> so  
basically it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running  
and as part of that you want to um check the boundaries  
and we can put all the options into this screen  
but how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in christ's sake with remote control  
yeah  
okay  
it might not be it might not be completely confusing but i think you'll still <unk> it's still i don't think it's practical at all  
'cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone  
cool i'm gonna go and sit on my own  
yeah  
do you take triangles or  
mm-hmm  
i'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that i'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference  
so you put a menu in the l. c. d.  
oh and uh that's uh that's all  
like five six is uh decent  
hand dynamo battery kinetic solar cells  
i know i know i know  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but you can appreciate the way they look  
it's the you know it's a communication device people see you with it all about and  
hello good day  
it's a  
who's pinging  
two r. <unk> and a one  
no no no  
'kay  
yeah yeah it's not really true  
so we are going to have a meeting about the functional design  
yeah  
mm  
maybe it's easier  
okay that is post analysis  
first years  
if you can um just give it you know give it your best guess in these cases  
yeah  
because you know  
it uh i'm not sure  
right  
look for any features or anything are there  
can you draw uh um rabbit  
i did my best  
i  
hmm  
which is you  
uh  
even with uh s. and r. <unk>  
twelve point five  
curvy  
ah no new email  
well that <unk>  
this i this is the logo  
oh no i mean the eye link software  
so you see the mold is there  
well maybe we can use a light for that  
no wait the top one i think you should include  
huh  
they have s. d. k. uh software development kit that is based on uh m. f. c. libraries and c. plus plus libraries  
so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible  
so i'm not gonna let that worry me  
yeah  
is that okay  
i think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature  
so  
i agree  
yeah  
it's in there already  
and the youngsters love 'em fun for the whole family everyone can have their own  
uh it's continuous for dissolves  
i'll be looking out next time i need to write an essay  
did you open it already or no  
hmm yeah  
okay  
maybe th th th that's just some people that like that  
our limited ability to think outside the box  
okay  
mm-hmm  
right  
yeah  
um  
so  
because so many of those remotes that you see these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality  
okay  
mm  
does that move it  
um okay back to agenda  
yeah  
yeah it's cheaper to produce  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh  
and you select that one click again and you go one step back  
and image options right  
you know a whole batch of dialogues where uh all four participants are non native  
they think that or do their doctor the doctor says  
and depending on what our um zoom level is we just display a part of it  
yes one  
yeah  
<unk> seven  
yeah we yeah that's true that's one of the problems  
you know <unk> not <unk> people when they buy it they have to think well this one lasts for a long time  
yeah but  
but we do focus on younger people  
all four of those little containers  
mm-hmm  
yes but that maybe  
although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though do you  
right  
so we're actually now uh in a sense  
for instance tune in their the stations  
and uh here's the battery  
yo forrest hill whatever one's easier to discuss stuff i don't know  
yeah  
oh god  
okay but how do we make the the scroll uh button  
and that it controls the channels and the the volume  
yeah  
what do don't have to draw it exactly do we  
yep yep  
mm  
three is uh a bit uh oh what am i doing  
uh not on that but  
it's okay  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so this would <unk> includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well and colour and so on  
and and probably separate to that an information about the different topics like that  
yeah chunks are gonna be named entities if nothing else  
i'll i should leave that one on there shouldn't i before i callously rub it off  
i know  
that's true  
yeah  
yeah me too  
five  
so um um on top of this there's another part uh which is more linked to the tracking  
so that was the opening  
a a more friendly type of  
yeah  
we it's fine on my screen but never mind  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
right uh  
you have a button you you press it and this is uh the previous channel which has come back  
i mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things  
yeah  
'cause it i think if we have an l. c. d. it will also sell a lot better  
that's how we use it  
and very you know details about which task is this you know  
yeah and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day  
but  
let's say this is the side view  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control  
i see  
okay  
see i only got blank ones  
a very of course  
so  
but  
feel i think  
so let me bring that up  
hmm  
mm  
yeah no  
that's what i understand so hello  
so buy one  
right  
as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting um become acquainted with each other  
hmm  
well uh  
and uh kate and kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at  
okay  
sorry about this  
okay  
so i want each of your presentations to not be too long five five minutes something like that  
okay  
i mean like no i think it's very fashionable  
i'd go more yeah <unk> more for clap  
yeah for favourite animals  
okay  
also <unk> yeah 'cause you would be <unk> looking down at the l. c. d. screen than back up at your t. v. and people don't wanna do that  
no  
you know and just like sort of all our fiddle factors  
um i <unk> i su i mean for the specific functions you know up and down uh play stop  
i don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty  
and this is a source signal which is hilbert carrier  
and you can code java  
i don't know  
it's not only with this model it's in spectra and shifts in deltas because  
mm-hmm  
but you know we can we can discuss this but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general but done well  
if we want the nice cheap one the simple then we can only have push buttons  
well let's see  
um  
yeah  
i guess not  
experience with a remote control  
yeah that's true  
no but it doesn't <unk> say anything about a colour or but mm  
inside  
yeah i figured i figure we could do that  
to log in  
sorry man  
so we'll <unk> because i think uh it it it has not been even submitted outside also the work what jean yves did yet  
so our our our remote control has to be better  
yeah we don't  
i know this name uh  
uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus  
i thought that was the problem that your mornings weren't sliced off on the booking system  
or ami data  
mm-hmm  
for the components design um next step is basically the the way the <unk> gonna work is still the same idea as before  
um  
hmm  
yeah i agree on this  
yes excellent  
and but which uh phone it is  
but you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time  
um so  
right so so the <unk> the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons  
they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh i think it's brilliant  
hmm  
yeah  
save copy  
if we can build on this with the speech recognition that's not something i'd thought about at all but it's also something we can discuss  
mm-hmm yep  
if they can easily recover it well  
like bag <unk> yeah  
well i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the  
hmm  
there's a guy who says project instead of product and uh it's something like project and it's probably just his his pronunciation of of  
yeah that's right  
no no no no <unk> wherever this is going it doesn't sound good  
yeah  
i think so it i think it could  
maybe it's single curved we have no idea  
think about  
but still  
industrial designer  
is then a chance maybe that it doesn't try to load them all into memory at the same time but just  
no i'm user <unk> i'm user interface design  
so that you can yell at it yeah  
and what we may be able to do and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these  
yeah because then it would be quite easy to re integrate it into such a  
uh  
price  
the options are it uh little bit harder but if you touch the options then it's uh  
oh five minutes  
that's that's the outside  
so you just miss the back end which is easy because it's h. t. k. it's everyone knows here  
so it could either be a two or a one  
on your marks get set go  
mm  
okay so this is good enough  
mm  
and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and  
it's will <unk> your house your home and your t. v. so  
well wednesday  
that could be an uh instant uh feedback  
uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the <unk> uh decisions sebastian makes  
mm  
and then we would create the file of that type which we probably couldn't call it segment  
um so just so you know my method was mainly web web based research this time around  
okay  
yeah is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it <unk> uh remote controls fall a lot on the ground  
then for the components  
um  
um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder  
okay  
charted  
mm  
you you just write the write the numbers  
uh yeah  
mm-hmm that's the next one along yeah  
yeah so i <unk> i mentioned that because of spelling  
so some t. v. <unk> will have different encryption codes for doing <unk> <unk> uh channel changing and these things  
it looks like <unk>  
three  
this is about the total remote control  
yes but it  
right  
oh right  
um i thought the point about that was that we would put um into <unk> um serial categories all the segments of the same topic across meetings  
well that's so  
yes  
right  
they're looking at a pixel or something right  
okay  
<unk> why not we might have to get you up again then  
maybe  
only replaces a single remote control that you've already got  
yes uh right  
uh-huh  
yep  
we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals  
but phase you're not encoding anything  
i guess we might have to do that  
so it's a good evaluation  
yeah i understand  
plus plus okay  
mm  
translate the key press into an infra red signal and this is received by the t. v.  
sports and gaming  
yeah  
yeah  
audio settings screen settings even teletext and channel settings  
okay so we can go to the slides  
yeah  
yeah you know the the  
okay nice  
that's right that's what they're after  
we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want it doesn't matter it's spongy material it's not gonna break you know  
f. n. and f. eight did you say  
don't ask me <unk> precisely what conceptual design is it's just something important that we need to do  
yeah  
no problem  
slide show  
oh <unk> frustrated  
yep  
but if they also buy it then it's alright  
so we come bring it down to  
yeah  
they are working on a okay good  
it depends on the talk  
mm mm  
yeah  
oh now i'm line  
can bring out when needed  
like if you don't have a sound card it crashes even if you don't use sound  
okay  
is it much changes  
so that basically just be working on the prototype uh we'll accomplish your other two actions  
yeah  
it's uh from uh our coffee uh  
um different designs and one of the things that <unk> we need to watch out for is a v. in volume because people some  
function f. eight it  
oh how can i uh  
i think we take with you  
yeah  
so  
so i think we all agree with that  
yeah  
but actually a set selection does everything you want sort of  
well like if you go to one uh whichever one you were working yeah and you just click file save as  
i thought you like it  
yeah  
yeah  
so that's from w. fifty two  
and the buttons as well i think  
so  
yeah  
yes  
uh-huh  
does it save automatically in the project folder  
uh no  
just we'll just write you know little help files or something  
hmm  
are you using the you are doing the in  
yeah  
in the informatics building there oh sorry in in appleton tower five the ones closest <unk> two machines closest to the support office  
mm-hmm  
alright  
like what all colleagues said have to have to be <unk>  
mm-hmm  
and then you can start again  
throw some plastic in it you know  
that's a very old one rather  
i think that one's my favourite  
th they you <unk> you see it in the clothes and everything  
and i've read somewhere that i've got some kind of veto veto uh rights  
um and <unk> yeah what analysis we can pull out of it  
and maybe as far as design goes maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences  
and  
okay  
yeah  
so some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly  
no if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh playstation uh game controller  
or uh not square but why is it yeah sharp corners  
from the website it looks it's quite innovative but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's you know fifteen quid  
now we have to make some concept  
hmm  
oh like a  
better for people with um <unk> no what's it called r. s. i. what was it that we were talking about  
it's only like i'm writing an algorithm that which then tries to also again based on word <unk> occurrence patterns try to link together maybe different ones of those  
um  
the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design  
better  
okay and final question  
so to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing  
we should probably inquire about that or like integrate tool tips that would be visible  
maybe  
choose a number  
the triple r.  
yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future  
and uh some sort of locator  
this energy source of course is connected to  
so what we want to go to is not this one but more less buttons easy some bigger buttons  
but uh in contrary to to having al another keyboard and mouse that only one person can use  
yeah  
so i think she just she didn't catch the full form  
okay  
because this is the thing we were not planning to um transfer into this format  
or just leave it  
well i i think if we're gonna i think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with <unk> i don't think you could even get teletext information from the t. v. onto the remote control  
yeah  
i've seen more urine in this city than ever before i mean  
can we remove this when you are going to this place  
and after the next one we will have again the um  
and another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things  
so but we have to be critic critical about it  
i'm sure  
so how much is four <unk> four thousand gigabytes  
it's a tape free but also video  
okay universal is good  
now the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect which is twice as important as the third a aspect  
when it is an introduction  
okay so <unk> oh sorry  
um okay it's big it's got a great memory  
no  
it's not a mushroom  
yep  
yeah  
no uh i <unk>  
yeah  
so i can uh qui oh  
so but yeah  
i think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah  
um alright  
and you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while  
like soft or something  
yeah okay  
yeah  
no uh this is just a description of what we see there  
or  
um and each of us will get help from our coach  
i have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion  
better to collect and sort  
they the the the the the side view we didn't uh  
as you can see you can give a presentation on them  
or this kinesthetic one would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control  
a yeah otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get <unk> any feeling then  
ours is a bit uh different  
large button large buttons  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that wouldn't have been that difficult but sometimes it's just a false start  
these are the things we identified as being important  
yeah yeah  
and it's got the thing on the inside  
mm  
and a button for t. v.  
okay  
it's not a microphone  
by half second you'll miss words  
with the scroll button  
we didn't exactly do everything but so  
yeah  
yeah the i just don't think it's worth wasting too much time on it  
innovation  
hmm  
um as far as speech recognition goes um the younger group looks like they're all for it  
as opposed to the twenty euros twenty five euros  
yeah that'll be for the future i guess  
but this is mainly <unk> who was doing this  
yeah that's right and you one colour per remote  
that's just for current trend  
yeah copper i just a <unk> basic uh  
<unk>  
democratically  
that's it  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
can we use b. nine for the posters for instance  
mm  
and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements  
yeah okay  
yeah you can point to that  
yeah  
and the second one is the user interface designer  
okay  
yeah  
or holster whatever you wanna call it  
ah  
three  
right  
i think so  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
well i'd say shop around but with our time constraints is that really a feasible option  
but i don't care  
or a buzzer  
yeah  
no it wasn't that far back  
that is the sample sensor and sample speaker  
right  
but uh  
yeah  
okay  
i need a product to market  
no it's people in in in milan and uh in paris that are gonna buy it  
ah you forget about it  
we see that other people are working et cetera  
yeah  
nothing right  
uh i think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea  
well that would be in the same file wouldn't it  
let's move on to the next page  
yeah  
yeah  
but this is uh  
we have two new teachers for s. p. two  
there i yes  
they  
yeah  
right  
working design  
i think these should be in one big circle in the middle  
i don't know  
and i would add uh one more  
m. e. the user requirements  
so that i don't think that would be very informative for high level <unk> analysis  
but then i've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons you can't tell what they do  
um  
oh no i didn't have that  
and usually cats are very friendly  
so this is basically the deluxe edition  
uh that uh  
yeah  
i just don't know about that  
mm  
and for example uh if you mention this one approach with the that uh trajectory of the phase  
i <unk> i know what's gonna happen in in yeah so  
yeah  
okay  
so like an <unk> <unk> density score for each meeting and each topic segment  
yeah  
so so uh yeah so as long as long as they're yeah  
there's no <unk> features of our controller so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features  
doesn't make much make much difference  
yeah and then <unk> we <unk> mm  
and uh so uh next i need to uh review the literature and uh come up with <unk> schemes for the real data annotation  
yeah that's true actually that's the best reason for cutting them down  
yep  
uh we've got solar cells  
user interface concept  
uh so for some part of th that kind of meetings um uh several utterances or dialogue acts are just uh tagged as statement  
oh we'll wait outside  
i would say five  
yeah  
so i th i think th there there was also this one guideline of saying for example if something uh is sitting under a negation  
champagne  
so hi christa  
cat's  
what we could say about the reading room is that we we squeeze quite a lot of people in in the other offices so i think it's okay  
well it's quite complicated  
would the others  
yeah  
yeah  
so the uh method  
um i think it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your t. v. or other thing is  
maybe <unk> maybe we maybe <unk> <unk> can we get email here  
so well done with the management i felt well managed  
<unk> yeah  
cool thank you  
sure you can yep  
now uh the single curved idea was uh  
mm-hmm <unk>  
so what are the other things we need to discuss  
let's throw it into there and then from there decide whether it's basic or it's non basic  
there you go  
well  
oh that's the next  
hmm  
yeah  
oh yeah it  
hmm  
guess we're getting straight back into business here  
mm-hmm  
just yeah  
so um  
and new ideas found  
okay first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here  
right um  
though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day  
it still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold yeah  
just for <unk> speech  
mm-hmm  
okay  
nah i think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group because we're that's what we're <unk> on  
i think i've gone a bit far in cutting mine down at the moment  
um for one thing because having controls with d. v. d. v. c. r. that sort of thing would really complicate the design of the remote control  
like a break you say oh look there's  
it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted  
mm-hmm  
uh this is this email  
that would be really useful  
nah the leadership wasn't crappy it was the leader that was crappy  
'cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time so  
can you tell what this is about  
yeah  
voice over i. p. or yeah  
it's not a mature technology i think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control so  
so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide <unk> uh <unk> uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn  
it was really large database so it the <unk> the quality will be better because you can find similar yeah  
and uh we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh <unk> uh yeah uh uh <unk> how do you say  
using the t. v. to access the internet  
it might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor  
yeah but we uh you mean the rubber stuff  
scheduling  
yeah okay you're right  
in this case we would be doing given that you know a word how good is it at predicting from which um specific topic that was  
um  
that's a a technical <unk> in psychological research  
this is black  
okay number six  
i think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics  
uh yeah hope i hope so very soon  
f. five  
i think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe <unk> um  
and in the end we calculate an average  
i i think so  
we already have the all the technology in house it's ready to go it's packaged it's  
i know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people <unk> drift away without anything actually really being decided  
i think so  
yeah  
okay  
so maybe in terms of sort of <unk> and <unk> we're pretty much the same maybe  
okay  
hmm  
and uh and a waterproof box as well  
and so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that <unk> the other way up  
do a quick pass of the main sections again and think ah yeah  
and we take after the time code insertion we take the video signal and we pass through the machine  
it's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe  
but it's okay  
i think so  
yeah  
no yeah okay okay  
okay  
the trend is spongy and vegetable fruits  
and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here  
but what are they gonna be next yeah  
but i think uh with twelve euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items  
hmm  
so i think we can put um  
yeah  
yeah maybe that's what they are  
so so p. l. p. <unk> or these are all thirteen just only p. l. p. <unk> not deltas and del  
yeah i was just thinking the self same thing  
or that <unk> yeah  
more like a traditional remote control  
um  
yeah layout  
because i  
more kind of hand held more um not as uh <unk> and or organic yeah more organic shape i think  
right  
right  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
and this one is  
ah  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's  
'cause i think <unk>  
and like each time you want a higher level you just need to go up the tree  
yeah  
uh-huh mm  
wow  
but it's pretty funny  
so yeah  
you don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go  
yeah th power  
i think  
yeah yeah  
that's quite good  
i i think if you have the button at the right i don't think you can find the option button that easy  
it's no what it is it's it's very  
don't know  
the agenda  
mm  
twenty minute yeah  
like if you if you first if you read through the summaries they read suspiciously fluent like as in people's questions and answers  
that's not a big deal think  
so this device on <unk> that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically  
yeah but i do it with perl it's just string manipulation  
what about what if the the volume on the t. v. <unk> turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote  
paint it  
at four yeah  
th they're saying <unk> and that's it  
and  
the basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial  
okay  
exactly  
but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management  
okay  
what do you think that means  
mm  
it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting  
can we ta can we tag the constructs with what's in them  
i it's a frequency yeah yeah  
so that's pretty fantastic  
mm-hmm  
um  
yeah  
and we just go on and don't throw anything away  
yeah the back  
so but you're yeah  
because of the way it's laid out because of the pictures on it and because of all of that  
maybe that's an uh a different  
um which was used fourteen times per hour followed by the volume button which was four times per hour um  
i don't know  
it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote you know your <unk> your cell phone  
and one um segment can have or one um of those word strings that are presented in one line can have several um dialogue acts annotated on it  
yeah but you don't use that th games when you watching television i think  
yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching  
so  
i mean  
i think we should just go with the simplest option on everything uh and that would be infra red energy source that would be batteries  
just have to  
we have to be careful with that word but uh anyway i continue my presentation so yeah channel selection is um very important very often used  
the <unk>  
so i will try to get my presentation running  
so um  
and so the last point is <unk> also would do you want to have some very cheap  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
ah we can do the math  
detachable battery  
one two three four five si  
especially if we are marketing it as a separate product people are gonna be paying uh  
yep  
okay so fifteen to thirty five look fairly young  
too bad  
yeah  
goes to the s. q. l. database and gets like basically in the end gets just a time marker for where that is like that utterance that we are concerned with  
once i i um coded the most expensive part in c. just to see so you can have a mix of both  
mm  
yeah <unk> then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together  
okay  
<unk>  
mm  
here we are  
yeah exactly  
or  
but i'm not sure it's really relevant  
yeah  
<unk>  
oh so it is your baby then on the photos  
yeah  
but has <unk> is fairly powerful product whatever who do we really want to aim that at  
yeah  
that's <unk>  
what we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television  
you could put in another well in this one you've actually got three colours of buttons  
see that i that's talking about the the flux of kin of <unk> photons rather then the continuum of that spectrum  
okay  
mm-hmm  
then two programmable chips for both software <unk> and communication  
emission feature again  
yeah  
maybe some yeah  
mm-hmm  
yes  
that that's uh  
yeah  
'cause i think we uh yeah i think that's what what what they uh mean  
that's the problem  
<unk> uh what you get is uh the real position or uh just uh the angle at which the the sound comes  
yeah  
don't know if you can use it but  
well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern  
uh that that's where i stop  
and uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one  
well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends <unk> <unk> every year  
yeah  
uh less important is tel teletext  
well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons  
yeah a microphone yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah  
or so <unk> you must save it at the end and then  
mm  
no no th all that's why we have all these numbers  
when something is original it tends to be trendy probably or we should make it combination of that  
right  
mm  
um so i was looking at how we're going to go about the working design  
and this is also for you  
line ratios  
so  
uh  
yeah  
how <unk> cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things  
so  
'cause it if you're just adding the length of the blink to the fixation you're not treating it as a <unk>  
well easy to use uh <unk> is a bit uh <unk> with the first uh functional is not an issue and then easy to use  
no so a a few legs  
if anything we build in a time bomb that only fails if the date is the date of the presentation  
so it should be in there  
i think we need like some general discussion at the end probably  
i opened uh the c. d. rom box uh guys  
and then it's a case of defining <unk> all these other transformations that you want  
so double curve  
yeah different requirements  
yeah  
uh i think in each ball you have three three uh yeah three yeah  
and uh the second question was about um uh filtering and uh f. f. t. yeah what you can get from it  
we're gonna talk about it you know tuesday at such such a time unless you  
i'm right here  
um as you see now i can give a presentation  
<unk> the record that we are getting in the first instance is about the <unk> about these you know they're looking at some region of the screen defined <unk>  
mm-hmm  
well we have lots of options  
yeah so the key thing is he here is mutually exclusive and exhaustive  
okay  
yeah  
no not yet  
slight difference i guess  
yeah  
so  
i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large  
well <unk> basically the um for <unk> for uh i mean <unk> each manufacturer will have a <unk> will have a particular command set that uh the t. v. responds to  
it could make an we could have any kind of style  
yeah yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
i mm  
<unk> you have to we have to scrap four points  
you'd want like a softer touch  
and uh maybe not use the special form  
it's uh it's all very uh  
yeah yep  
so you can have um uh for one person you can have uh a high energy signal which is difficult to locate and visa versa  
yeah yeah  
how about we do a uh a pop up screen like the laptop  
maybe like it'll beep or something  
might be something to consider  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah definitely  
you had one i think called free space or spare spare place  
but just like how much this word tells you about <unk> how likely that <unk> the occurrence of that word makes it that it's a specific segment topic segment  
with two buttons you do this like uh volume up volume down  
okay  
so we shouldn't be at re really attached  
from the  
a woo wood uh wood uh wood colour  
it's very cheap  
um and you need a user interface  
yeah  
this is pretty standard remote  
um then we have uh separate menus for teletext screen settings audio settings and what else  
know what i mean  
we want uh we want our controller to be smart so maybe we should uh use um uh  
okay  
um but <unk> well time's getting on  
it's worth the trouble i think because  
right  
mm  
alright  
no that's dependent on the television  
postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting because we're running out of time  
no but but uh it  
then this um card with the code i. v. c. card and to to try this  
yeah  
it's time  
oh yeah something like that  
the same word the word yesterday would be would have the same score all over the place  
she was cutting off rather than saying she would like <unk> to have see something  
uh-huh yeah sure  
um at least for the basic controls maybe we can balance it that way you know we can see  
mm-hmm  
well if  
yeah  
well we might want it but  
and you have you know this <unk> this solar receptor that you know yes  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i think that's a <unk> species again  
so  
no that's true  
mm-hmm  
that can be applied in many  
oh that's just bad  
okay  
on the on the recognition yeah  
i don't understand that  
uh  
so um yep i'll just uh switch that back here  
okay  
mm  
so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something will really come into play with a lot of these people  
yeah  
but they have <unk> maybe a bit over a theta byte worth of web pages in this a bunch of servers  
uh other functions  
uh in this meeting i i'm going to discuss about the trend watching uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this  
uh oh i've forgotten to mail you the minutes but i will do  
but  
he's gonna get his pen  
okay question number three  
we can put then  
sorry  
um  
back to the costs  
the remote control's uh uh that <unk> makes uh zapping easy  
yeah  
<unk>  
and damped lyman alpha data  
we <unk> maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly  
no it's just a single microphone  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
and um if you could document it for me that's probably enough for me to add it in  
mm-hmm  
oh okay <unk> okay okay  
yeah  
yeah that's what i know  
yeah you you won't be using it so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting  
when we were talking about rubber i think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of <unk>  
uh  
yep  
i think it takes up a lot of a lot of power  
so how do we work with that  
that's singly curved  
yeah it's this one  
okay well um  
mm-hmm  
uh i there are well they're already identified as blinks  
if you use a planar geometry like this one  
a little a little bit  
i remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable  
yeah but you don't do the overlap on the time domain  
yeah right and i do think we have to keep this kind of idea  
uh  
at the user  
so that's another marketing point that we can use  
not to put you on the spot but  
well with twelve euro fifty as production cost we can't uh afford an l. c. d. uh  
i dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual t. v.  
yes sure  
what's on the agenda  
so um are th  
that's it's less uh yeah  
'kay  
a two  
okay  
simple  
you you don't have to use standard uh  
yeah  
this is what we're looking for  
for not for no no  
alright and the last criteria is it is it um  
so that's the standard method for marketing okay  
i got it fixed in the last whatever one hour or something  
'kay  
thank you  
a any  
and the  
mm-hmm  
okay  
well we'll have a look at it yeah  
like  
yeah you you have some t. v. <unk> any  
well that's not my fault  
are they complete did they discuss everything that we covered last time  
so um  
mm-hmm  
no so i just work here a few minutes  
<unk> something like this  
yeah  
i think he's had something like seven  
yeah  
sure  
ooh  
right  
okay um so  
so first thing is we need power source for the remote control  
then press on remote press on and then t. v. should be available  
yes  
we also have to compare it to the uh  
we want something that looks nice and simple  
like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours shapes material they wanted uh from elderly and young people  
yeah  
so let's try it this way  
like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l. c. d. does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount  
so any changes you make to one are made to the other and if you do that around five corners  
yeah  
okay  
um well this was because of our last discussion if multiple machines are used create easy switch between the machines but um it's no longer uh applying  
<unk> jordan cohen  
so  
it's just a half round half half circle at and then it falls exactly over the hand and that's very nice  
<unk> isn't an instrument  
yeah yeah  
no you know it's a conceptual question  
yeah i think it does  
good luck  
so we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out  
mm  
twelve euro forty cents i came up with by leaving out the solar cells  
um it is yeah  
mm-hmm  
as a banana  
so just kind of <unk> the clutter  
but then we could make a docking station  
no because we did not know anything about it  
so so okay  
thanks  
um and lastly the transmission interface is uh just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about  
we have a goal of being able to do this with the meeting browser um what kinds of dialogue structure would we need to be able to do that  
um  
well but there is no day to respect  
well then i suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow  
uh  
okay  
but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet  
right  
yep that's it in it  
okay this is gonna <unk> this is what we gonna make together and okay i will arrange this and you will arrange that  
yeah  
so and then we can evaluate on the <unk> you know pretty easily  
yeah function words or just very general nouns  
would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or  
or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote an expanded version  
yeah it's really but uh how much you can get the compress these like what you're telling is you can do all these tricks like  
okay  
you need to separate it  
so that's what we need to go for  
that's true  
rechargeable but it you're the remote also can act as a <unk>  
<unk> what you're saying is that you want to know in the critical you wanna know after they're they're looking at triangle one what's happening in this period with this guy  
so we come to the third meetings  
um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
yep  
and it would check whether the the label he assigns so in this case annotation word <unk> are correct  
well you need  
well i i i would <unk> i would say give a <unk> give a selection of colours  
but this <unk> is more appealing to old people and we don't want that  
i don't think so  
mm  
yeah  
this time it's the three i killed  
so i dunno i i think it's gone okay today considering the information that we've  
yeah you probably are right  
okay so that's something that's kind of in the making too like maybe it'll become more  
uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high end product if  
i think technically it's acceptable so  
so there's no  
but the technology was uh fantastic  
so it'd only matter if it occurs on ones that are really highly ranked  
like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit  
i hate doing work for nothing  
mm  
'cause that already that already picks up like target regions things like that  
alright  
yes  
it you don't  
yeah  
if you just take one of them alone  
i'm from estonia uh yep  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
um it could be made a bit smaller and and of course it would be and yeah  
is that what we're supposed to say  
um which is usually a battery right  
no no i think you yeah it's uh it's huge  
to whom  
uh the important ones like power volume and jump between channels  
uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close  
yeah  
mm mm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but if we had all the buttons in black and a design in and the outside in yellow  
and does anyone really want to go first  
but what i'm really like because the <unk> um calculation is so simple maybe we should look into making that score just as a preliminary score that we have  
shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group  
yes okay  
uh ask whether um common remote control looks good or not about willingness to spend money on remote control  
output file <unk> it's the distance um between each histogram  
will have come in contact with that kind of use  
neither are all <unk> all the customers we have either  
yeah  
because well it's a simple function but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it  
and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um  
later  
but it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe or like these old uh phones  
videos d. v. d. <unk> um satellite boxes which uh i mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise  
well for some reason i can't get it to just go to that slide directly  
yeah  
no  
mm  
uh i think in the video there's two there's two video one is a real video and the other is a just uh introduction when you have the menu  
but again isn't that too expensive  
the elderly people from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features  
yeah  
uh i personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something  
no i mean uh obviously your opinion i'm just trying to  
so maybe in a sense not having that maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side  
perfect just save it please  
i will take this time just to <unk>  
yeah martin  
computer's adjusting  
um mm thank you mm  
it's a specially ugly colour but it's not special  
yeah they <unk> they'd they'd probably hate you for doing it  
yeah  
yeah  
but i mean that's maybe even the advantage here because you it's not speech <unk> based which means we are not  
so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television  
so uh f. f. t. gives you a measure of these values  
i like it  
these technical engineers huh  
uh the last point is easy to use  
um  
so you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table but it's <unk> it's stands  
my turn  
but you know what i've just thought of there now  
uh it can happen that we don't  
and um basically on the slave machine we have two cards one for audio and one for video  
i think people find that then it's easy to use  
i it's making the assumption that uh this human <unk> is related to the one that is discovered uh mm  
so we can maybe still use power button  
but well i don't know  
right yeah yeah  
you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours  
okay so yeah they're quite big and have many many buttons  
you can point to the line wings  
yeah you have to go back  
so we need to find a way of including these somehow  
i mean you have to know  
so um and that's the um transmit the l. e. d. thing  
well my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key ring  
we don't know  
well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one  
we should not give them the <unk> the most lovely front  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
so without l. c. d. how would you rate it  
sorry what's the i can't see  
okay  
do  
great  
the little buttons that actually you know that <unk> control stuff are behind the rubber  
uh the fancy look and feel  
so we would have like each of those components for  
um the <unk> the trains weren't stopping at the stations  
so  
mm  
right  
but we can just be consistent  
is it triangle one  
mm-hmm  
necessary yeah  
so i think if today we decide on what data we wanna have now and and later maybe even today  
i think that's the the things to do and uh to uh  
um <unk> presumably you want to be there  
mm-hmm  
yeah that  
mm  
mm-hmm  
uh the remote control <unk> should <unk> only be used for the television  
ah okay  
yeah yeah  
probably because you were doing seven thousand of these an hour  
thank you  
play doh  
then you you put the switch button then it  
see you could <unk> two options  
uh prototype presentation we dropped  
yeah  
i think somebody's masters project to look in how far english is <unk> uh or in how far english is a shaping influence on programming languages  
yeah  
so you can you decide whatever quality you want  
because it is true that i mean if you look at things like damsel and other attempts to come up with annotation schemes for for dialogue acts  
okay so it's uh  
uh so it's visible  
mm  
maybe i have a different one  
uh what i did was i reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups  
they have all ah  
is this it  
they said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls  
um the user interface is critical here  
but it could be these things are corrected for blinks in this way plus there's blink information  
um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away  
that's why they make <unk> like that i think  
so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a <unk> sort of a <unk> formality then an actual  
uh  
and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of <unk> uh a fancier remote control  
yeah  
i would do a battery we do  
but it's original  
just four  
did you take the one you found in the in the um x. m. l. file and just know put it there  
hopefully ninety five percent i know but that five percent  
mm  
okay  
oh right  
yeah yes  
mm  
so i think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features  
uh uh if i pick this up which is a physical action you can't reject that  
which is good as as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway  
yes uh-huh  
no  
be fun with <unk> too like make a remote control or spaceship  
okay <unk> <unk> that was the main point i think from the trend  
oh it's just participant one oh okay  
that's what it's makes it special  
i know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but i'm thinking one of the <unk> that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy  
the pen  
it i th i thought it was called pas so i think just use this  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
but anyway mis transcription so make sure if the speaker said will  
need do be different  
yeah  
yes but i just got it  
this would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time  
so oh okay  
but uh  
and then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever  
in in some cases it's gonna be a bad thing <unk> because <unk> every page is linked by the way the algorithm works  
excellent  
oh yeah no ha ha  
yeah mainly the <unk> <unk> or for output  
so  
okay  
okay  
wait  
he's being paid in arrears  
so you really need a some kind of indicator so it could be a blinking option of l. e. d. it could actually be used to detect also  
mm  
okay the push button no  
okay  
and this the three of those are the <unk> the the video  
well i agree  
no i i'm i'm not arguing  
and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis a vis the total cost of the product  
uh you have all on your remote control  
uh if that's if you're finished  
kinda cool  
individual work and a meeting and then the detailed design individual work and a meeting  
yeah exactly that  
yeah uh what is it devices  
hmm  
okay  
okay  
uh okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe  
yeah  
so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel  
we have all the scripts  
that we should just stick on yeah  
but how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh <unk> ho how good is it you know uh voice recognition <unk> are still quite uh  
three different types of batteries  
is that the idea  
yeah  
it might be the four way scroll too  
uh well  
well special colour  
and you're gonna want forced alignment  
to make it quite uh an universal uh device uh  
but then it  
i dunno where it yeah  
no it's 'cause the uh the shift <unk> stuck or something  
<unk>  
i feel like i'm just shooting everything down here  
of or you should put it in the l. c. d. screen  
i think yeah  
mm mm  
but that that that's that yeah that's a reason but also for our creativity  
yeah  
then i guess not then  
sure  
so  
yep  
i've never seen one of them before  
so i dunno it's maybe difficult to have both i mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and  
so next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh  
but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away <unk> instead of using uh plastic hard plastic or uh titanium  
an  
and that uh provides parental control for instance  
yeah  
then there's also enough room for the electronics  
yeah yeah  
should we take that off uh  
gets the remote control  
yeah but it wasn't me it was him closing something  
yeah  
yep  
yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey  
and um material  
can you talk to remote control  
now right  
like running along the bottom  
i know that it consumes lots of energy  
yes that's right but star burst is different  
yes yes  
wee  
if the time of flicking from one to other but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it  
yeah  
it it's only used for uh getting the a direction when you have a microphone array  
mm there is a a the free one is okay  
the standards  
no no those things i'm also having because they were done two years back  
<unk> shortcuts  
it <unk> it would increase the cost  
um so basically uh the as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it  
well um possibly  
or is it cut off  
mm-hmm  
yes  
okay  
uh we wouldn't even need the numbers  
so dave and me look at how nite x. m. l. works and we're  
and in that menu scroll click one step back  
you have to <unk> <unk> train it to <unk> to learn channel fifteen that whole thing  
i don't think it's very difficult though  
let's build it into a sponge  
but i think dave what we should do is that th uh the time click of the clock i think that's changeable  
were were you we're finished  
all done thanks  
and while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around  
but um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow  
okay  
i think that's fair yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah i could see here i mean that it was like horse it was only one single one  
okay  
although i think we yeah  
um yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
maybe if we just sort of pool what we know about the x. m. l. format and try to make sense of it  
but you can make it on a single p. c. with three different options  
like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying mummy i wanna buy that one  
okay  
god i <unk> i would say that's required  
so  
yeah  
you could maybe <unk> that screen and then  
mm-hmm  
or not  
yeah if it's just running a script i don't know if it's  
and is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features or are we gonna eliminate those  
and uh <unk> big buttons <unk> uh that's easier to use than uh i think  
yeah  
what are we doing  
yeah i th i think you're right  
yeah  
uh-huh  
uh it's gonna be small  
i don't know  
um  
so first  
person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah i'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design  
if this was a successful remote we might then produce a higher end version of it i think  
mm  
yeah and you you you will not have <unk> enough a lot of place to put a l. c. d. on a banana also  
so that way the remote reads it  
but if it was a damped lyman alpha quasar  
maybe you can select it  
but  
okay  
oh there is no listing for <unk> radio frequency thing  
so the the the first one is uh <unk>  
okay  
'kay this should be then  
change colour of <unk>  
oh buttons oh so um  
probably i mean  
yeah  
good morning  
so we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically  
yeah he's keeping same number of frames  
yeah and then you sort of feed the time stamp to and the nite x. m. l. central manager  
but it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet  
so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape  
yeah it's very interesting  
but i do use the i do use the display of the time quite often but  
so um well you should uh try it but uh  
yeah  
and now 'cause i would be using it in java anyway  
that'll whatever it is it'll be the same skills as you've learned for something else  
i thought that it it should fit in the hand or something  
channel up  
i'd say no  
i think there needs to be one sort of extra higher goal above that so that you can motivate future research  
no it says what what is the kind of interface if it is <unk> then you got a zero point five  
so mm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
each  
so you're by saying that this clustering is closer to that clustering is is does that necessarily mean that it's better  
mm  
yeah  
what do you mean  
so we've got basically what  
so with the display  
if you really need an universal remote control or if you  
yeah you should you should drop the speech recognition  
okay  
mm  
okay  
the then we'll switch to my presentation  
okay  
it's too difficult  
you know  
but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in dutch  
uh  
um  
oh no no  
yeah  
yes  
then it beeps all the time and  
nah  
course there are lot lots of things that can do that  
and a plastic <unk> just plastic buttons a <unk> uh instead of rubber  
um and this would be  
but should it uh really be uh <unk> uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it <unk> more trendy  
if you haven't had time to prepare one you can draw stuff on the <unk>  
uh yeah  
the l. c. d. you know lighted buttons because you know it's i don't know um yeah in the dark  
hmm  
if it's on your h.  
yeah yeah that yeah yeah  
findings  
but suppose it was working correctly what uh would it be useful then if it wasn't off all the time  
uh  
yeah  
participant one  
yeah  
yeah  
okay so we have to go through each point  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
but uh i <unk> it might be worthwhile to check how much work it would be to do it over a flag  
this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or  
right  
i'm sure we'll have by the end of today  
okay  
or no no no uh <unk> i was in the middle of in the middle of your report there  
on the last one  
yeah  
<unk> i don't think that list is our final word on things and  
hmm  
thirty's really young eh  
it's not a lot one hundred <unk> it's not  
i don't know what just happened  
maybe we should go with a two then because it's not perfect because we can't do it initially but we  
so it was a bit of both really we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and  
uh just uh <unk> plate um is <unk> uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh  
as uh as wide <unk> certainly wider angle than than current so that if you're holding it you know  
start <unk> the the start uh to to to programme yeah  
so that will be about  
it's not like you know <unk> sitting there brain deadly constructing you know some models that she needs to do  
good  
else interpolate extrapolate  
mm-hmm  
make a remote that doesn't look like a remote  
however uh mm project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design  
um what else do you want to know  
um yeah that's good  
no no no no we we will uh this is a preference but we can always change uh  
do you do you have this uh information on the web page you said  
to the other design  
and yeah of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever  
we have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy  
no  
mm  
some basic things we co we want to going to do  
congratulations guys  
auto correlation coefficient and  
yeah now i now i understand now yeah  
uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions  
although if  
menu power  
effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side but you folded it in half  
failure  
i am the one who can say that  
as long as there's not a big pause between the <unk> hitting the two buttons  
um and that was our last meeting  
yeah i think  
yeah  
yeah  
channel selection  
yeah but this this mean that your t. v. would be able to you know connect to internet you know surf the web  
yep  
yeah  
it's it's it's parent child relationship  
well <unk> i we do want we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> less of an  
hmm  
so with their all their  
yeah  
i should reread what i signed there so  
yeah  
one hundred per cent that's your first thing you go oh i'm not gonna buy that 'cause i dunno if it works or not  
yeah but i think you ha i really need a menu button  
yes or at <unk> least um she was meant to have have some idea of the level of complexity  
th that's why this mm is not relevant any more i feel  
it's not so simple  
i <unk> that's important you know  
so it's sort of yeah  
quite quickly  
so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro um and we're aiming to make fifty million euro  
probably one or two  
you don't want your uh  
people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and i think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons  
but <unk> uh mm-hmm mm-hmm  
oh you don't like <unk>  
okay  
actually uh it's a flexible thing  
this one would be uh for grandmothers  
so in any case even if actually and they tend to be uh related or a statistically related to a single slide in any case in terms of uh recognition do not help at all or help a very little  
uh i think we should mark the special form thing because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons i guess  
yeah  
does anybody want to uh uh andrew do you want what do you want to say about um  
so uh  
yeah you must change the chip uh back  
i think we should  
well uh so you say this one already works to uh to tell the the direction  
without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
okay is there anything else at all it can do  
<unk> yeah yeah  
okay  
oh man  
mm i don't think it's that fashionable  
uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative it's three  
again i think the colour comes into this  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
<unk> or can we  
i think <unk> spongy is good because it it will be robust as well  
well i'm just comparing with uh l. p. c. ten standard which is like classical l. p. c.  
uh a soft material for a remote control  
and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse and you couldn't turn it off  
and a pen  
but if you were doing a search over the whole corpus you'd have to load them all  
i don't know how much power an l. c. d. would take but it might be quite low  
yeah  
mm  
we'll see later on  
we just stick to the trap  
um let's get started  
yeah it's it's in it  
yep  
you can make rubber in any colour  
'kay  
uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn  
so you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control  
bunch of new ideas  
yeah it's <unk> only for a limited vocabulary say eighty commands or so  
yeah and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television  
no no no  
no  
alan black and paul taylor they started <unk> festival in ninety six or something  
but p. l. p. is using just the <unk> uh direction  
'cause i'd sometime if it sounds like he could carry on saying the whole sentence i sometimes don't have a hyphen there  
but it is just a t. v. remote  
mm-hmm  
right  
yep  
mango  
well i'm not very sure  
stop your movie fast forward all this um freeze frame  
and i was i was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving  
so if we already have it in our remote control  
out  
or even you don't need to download it it's streamed uh online uh yeah  
so  
a rabbit  
the the evaluation give satisfying result as well  
oh okay well we we can discount back channels  
is this gonna be enough to to sell  
yeah that's it  
yeah  
<unk>  
if we have a better shape of the um remote control or better options on it  
three  
hmm  
and the standby button is gonna be different  
well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions and then look at the design  
the  
there will be six centimetres between each led with a blurring glass  
yep  
after two minutes or three minutes something like that  
okay fantastic  
alright let's take it  
there for the l. c. d. screen  
so yeah that was clear  
um i don't know we could use the voice  
and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well  
mm  
okay  
yeah is everyone who in here's right handed left handed  
yeah  
it's more sensible to have it as an option and the location of them  
technical function  
yeah  
mm  
sorry  
company  
yeah  
it it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen so if you're watching something  
no  
okay  
i learned a lot actually  
let's uh yeah let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation <unk>  
uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting  
then power instead of energy  
yeah yeah that's true  
hmm  
use them like that  
because they're very independent uh they're very intelligent compared to dogs maybe  
you want it curved or what  
sure that fits the  
okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do  
yeah  
one yeah  
that's  
the doesn't  
so you say <unk>  
they're gonna be at different red shifts  
who cares right  
my <unk> on two  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah yeah  
to the thumb yeah  
um is there anything anybody's unsure about  
what we can also do very simple is just to get the magnitude <unk> using this approximation without the carrier just hilbert envelope  
yeah i think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote  
but like remotes do tend to get <unk> thrown about a bit  
i dunno they're grumpy and nocturnal and  
i don't think so  
and in your remote control  
yeah  
cost  
and they are small  
yes  
so if it's dead obvious then that's fine  
um yeah um system properties um parental control  
okay  
okay  
yep  
yes and this also looks more fancy i think  
mm-hmm  
um  
yeah we have the wheel  
okay  
yeah  
actually honestly i i i dunno what's what's his it's be <unk> i dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh  
uh  
i think there is a distinction there and we don't have that  
okay  
hmm  
yeah okay  
we'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later  
i don't understand what you  
yeah i think assign your uh roles  
yeah  
yeah  
but <unk> do they what defines a micro quasar  
emission models definitely not  
don't mean to discourage you but uh basically  
it doesn't matter  
right  
is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa  
ah nothing that's  
and one back  
yeah <unk> i guess we decided on material right  
so it means <unk> you know i can i can spell it out  
okay  
yeah  
or a dinosaur  
yeah lights yeah there's no  
and it's still say it's for our needs so please press something  
no just four metre  
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel  
i would say  
well one needs to know the duration of these things right  
you probably get a mail  
alright so i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device  
only what happened to the single curve  
oh yeah yeah  
i think all of us agreed with those things  
yeah  
okay  
i think it's very uh very well met  
mm yeah it's not right so  
yeah um i guess people are willing to pay for that  
time  
first i'm just wondering about the l. c. d. stuff because uh because  
couple of dozen  
yeah but the those files can be recovered easily only thing is that uh now if they had to say that we cannot recover it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we have um i will work on the video acquisition for the <unk> the tape free smart meeting room  
so  
mm  
so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about you know the chip it is a low level chip and  
i'm sure i sure most the <unk> gonna be gonna be the same  
also but okay  
yeah  
and um well you <unk> you all know the t. v. levels  
and if you push parents then yeah  
oh right okay  
min  
but it's not uh an intrinsic limitation it's just because of <unk> yeah  
okay  
yes  
mm  
yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood  
so morgan was joking no what he informed me they are gone from <unk>  
<unk> why is the uh double curved two of them  
okay then <unk> make a new one  
this is where it's connected together and then when you open it out it could <unk> it could be maybe flip  
then we don't even have to worry that much about the underlying x. m. l. representation  
of the technical function so  
<unk> what's what's usual or normal  
or surfaces  
uh  
move along  
so we have to rea sorry i've accidentally highlighted somehow um  
yep  
yeah  
i don't know if  
um i think that's just for a video so we wouldn't need any of that at all  
many people wouldn't like it  
i've <unk> yeah i've no no noticed that the the the <unk> <unk> knows quite a few things as well  
i like the idea of the i mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down that one  
um  
um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings  
oh yeah  
so  
so  
ooh  
you have to draw it yourself now  
it's a new uh commercial logo  
uh what uh i have to do  
yep  
uh  
yeah the yeah  
so i would i would keep that  
so nobody <unk> will lost lose it  
okay  
because  
i think so too  
um so i understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip  
it does  
'kay  
should be yeah  
<unk> i <unk> uh it was not my uh pen  
uh yes the <unk> newer televisions ha do have menus  
okay  
is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated is it  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
but uh caroline then phoned up to chase them and they they were <unk> they were told to be here  
yeah you you you should we should a combination  
nope  
oh yeah just <unk> programme above i think  
yeah  
um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a t. v. set  
yeah  
it's not written  
so we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings  
uh look what  
so uh the way i do it now is uh to to take uh each top of the <unk> bottoms and uh just making leverage this  
manager i dunno okay which is bob uh  
mm-hmm  
uh yeah <unk> per <unk> uh i print the utterances in the i. d.  
um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going  
i think we can use excel  
hmm  
the cat is going to eat the fish or the rat  
mm uh-huh  
i would and i would know somebody who'd gone to know  
uh <unk> uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls  
geometry is not  
oh um mo no you can just say uh the <unk>  
no no you should separate them first yeah yeah  
and i i'm i'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette where you have the shape for your thumb  
i think that would be very easy if you could say okay i want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or  
like an uh <unk> uh  
um  
the <unk> very no no the first one  
nobody told me  
of course from the point of view of computation but otherwise it's there's no problem no  
yeah i'm just do you wanna plug in  
or un or try to understand how nite x. m. l. i. d. <unk> work and maybe there's some special route we have to follow when we use these i. d. <unk>  
right  
mm-hmm  
yeah you think  
it's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red so it's it's kind of user friendly  
but you could just use the whole corpus like this and and for some of them you assume you don't know the the category assignment  
but then you should also find a place you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something  
yeah i can imagine that  
have you tried <unk>  
yeah  
mm  
and this also um allows you to separate people  
right  
i would say uh about eight months to have the first results  
um so somehow that thing's too big but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition  
it'll be fine  
i'm not convince  
yeah  
yeah  
ah okay okay  
mm-hmm  
um i'm i'm gonna show this just what we have at the moment but it not gonna look very different from what we had last time  
um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for real reaction  
the older people only use five of them  
yeah  
are there some buttons  
okay  
you have to align the videos anyway right  
yeah this function is just for your browsing from one channel to th the next one the next <unk> <unk> <unk> the th the third one  
and otherwise internally we treat it like so we have continuous i. d. <unk> for the segments  
i think i can get that information yeah  
your los  
having it look really nice um and also be really durable  
do you a pretty <unk> slide of um my first cut design  
mm  
okay  
but yes nebula  
and  
no  
okay  
you don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings  
what's hot fruit and <unk>  
i'm sorry i did <unk>  
because our our motto is we put fashion  
as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo  
cookie  
should have the two sides  
but where do you have the original category information from  
uh so he's li  
no  
of the uh  
anyway so that is definitely at work  
or but but you could go in a in an double curves  
and uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody  
but um yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that  
yeah  
wow  
also since we're partners of the international remote control association maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal  
yeah  
so  
uh exactly yeah  
uh it's a bit too much i think  
hey with the whole new background being innovative yeah that was class  
but maybe you can show us first  
uh yeah everything i've  
<unk> uh quirky you know something people like oh yeah  
that's just  
but over time  
mm-hmm  
right  
so we've had some stuff put forward um  
well th that's that's really a step further  
uh i mean the um  
okay  
yeah  
alright  
so the technology is there  
i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left right up down and enter  
a as much as important than technology or fancy thing  
well what was said in in my group actually susan who knows professors from other um other faculties  
okay  
yeah alright but  
current remote controls do not match well the operating <unk> of the user  
only the l. c. d.  
and you then have at the uh at the bottom the l. c. d. and this would need to be articulated as well  
and  
um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of internet  
alright and that's it for the working design  
yeah  
questions  
one  
just so they could get the changeable face plates  
because after i mean even if it there we cannot put all the times in one week right  
there was room for  
yeah  
well it's just <unk> it's just it's just par participant one participant two  
mm-hmm  
oh well  
we have redesigned  
okay  
<unk>  
it's not that expensive to do  
mm yeah yeah  
um  
that's another interesting point  
okay  
uh well i think first off basically i do agree with what sarah has defined as as uh your personal  
yeah  
it's one year right  
yeah  
impersonal mm-hmm  
so it's not <unk> it's not <unk> necessarily  
great  
play pause  
how they worked uh what kind of components are involved and how they are connected together  
so we if we can design something that that looks interesting  
okay right  
you can you can ma yeah you can make a lot of extended menus  
this is this is very high powered stuff here double clicking there we go  
i have a presentation i'm just making this  
but everyone needs their own like specific notes i guess  
yeah  
i'm the marketing expert for this project  
yeah  
mm  
yeah you can make it a two  
okay that's great  
i know  
you <unk> you only have one pen for that screen  
or yeah  
technology such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology  
okay  
but um it's it's made edible 'cause yeah  
they they've i think they may have written this up um in a report um  
yeah i would assume so  
it's advantage  
and and this they showed it uh without this  
so we're relying on your <unk> script to get us the chopped version of the audio right  
right  
if you go for that th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two  
okay good morning  
and i prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner maybe maybe  
fantastic  
uh  
not with the speech recognition  
yeah if  
video and <unk> hi <unk> and stuff  
uh i'm just gonna use the <unk> uh  
okay  
something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand  
yeah and neither do i in fact  
mm  
well you you  
we'll have to do more research  
um i don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size  
cross the river where where is the bridge and and then okay so that was a different place  
okay  
and there's especially one there that um i think he's eastern european and i think that's the only reason i can understand what he's saying at all  
of what to do  
i'll  
yes  
um  
yeah alright  
no because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels  
volume maybe a mute button and then on off button  
and so you can <unk> your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs i dunno but  
i know you've got the pen you might attack me with it  
yeah  
yeah  
and if we had either of those for our budget they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition  
and it's not uh that's five minutes off uh implementing time i think uh  
and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand i think  
mm-hmm  
i don't think that's a good idea because isn't it like that we expect th there to change over i <unk> with the different topic segments more  
and you cannot even train it right  
hmm  
i don't see the  
um and i mean uh and and in in fact i mean it's what you're doing is so different to most approaches to speech coding that it doesn't matter that we don't know much about or haven't had much i it's i mean it's quite different to a lot of the traditional sort uh so uh <unk> um you know  
yeah  
exactly  
no  
i thought when they said voice recognition they meant um like channel five and it will change  
but you can men you can press menu again to get out  
okay  
um uh now before we go round everybody else does anybody um  
mm  
yes  
well the basic layout doesn't <unk> offer much but the voice recognition could add a lot  
yeah that's sort of like your level of the zoom  
yeah  
so electronic  
i don't think wood is a viable option  
okay it's not the prettiest i know  
hmm  
not enough buttons you mean  
mm-hmm  
i think so yeah  
i mean this is something that has been measured et cetera but still is a bit qualitative  
the colour is the colour acceptable  
do we actually have do we just have one special uh special forms down here  
i mean <unk>  
uh it costs extra  
but if if it's not clear do i just pick uh do you just pick the more <unk> alternative  
but we have to keep the cost in uh in mind but it  
is it's not uh it's not obvious  
and we are su and we are sure that in that uh context of <unk> project with uh um <unk> working on document analysis uh there were not enough precision un enough resolution in the slides  
i'm um answering your question  
yeah maybe yeah  
yeah  
this is nice and easy  
and on the on the d. v. d. i saw that there are some other stuff  
yeah sure of course you need uh a settings button uh or a settings option for the remote control  
what do you what do you guys reckon  
scrap sample speaker  
like i can probably help people if they have problems with getting getting what we have running now  
that looks boring i'll see if anyone's made a remote control  
one battery  
right  
and the what was the word they used  
for kids they want simply the <unk> <unk> for the old people they want simplicity so that's why we have the parental module  
and we thought about the logo big in the middle  
okay  
and then for example you you your task would be to say i have some page and and i know where it is in the in the in the directory  
i think they mean the line strength rather than the f. e. two abundance  
but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so  
t. v. only  
just like a playstation thing  
mm  
no maybe he has mentioned it to them but they just never talked to us  
but <unk> also if if pay is a matter um like if it's a matter that you haven't gotten paid for some reason  
mm-hmm  
seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly  
oh just just type mister fully  
um the lower part of it i don't know if you can see that properly  
although i don't see how we could have very <unk> at least for me i  
it's quite simple  
uh ye that's that's the way it's worked out  
well like function words and stuff  
so far i extracted um the <unk> durations  
and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability  
you know collaborative problem solving you know more than one person involved and trying to <unk> things as um  
alright  
they can be supplementary  
yeah  
it can be curved  
single curved  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so we have all that stuff here you know the parsed <unk> material  
you all know i hope how it's about uh the uh new <unk> remote control we are going going to design  
separate  
the thing which is gonna be hardest for me is making elaborate plans with you  
the one on the right is a lot more basic  
so it well is it <unk> is no it's nine point seven i've got  
and sort of the so this is <unk> so i think that basically i don't know what else i mean you should be asking questions right  
shall we move rapidly on to uh kendra  
maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around  
with the lapel  
and it's like forty <unk>  
two  
yeah  
<unk> maybe the file number or something that is in the beginning  
yeah  
yeah  
oh yeah  
uh i'm nick <unk> i'm the project manager  
this has a strong look  
bye  
work now  
i wouldn't count on it  
um then we will um do an evaluation  
you you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two you you skip this  
like a type of logo or colour so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be <unk>  
yeah  
i think it's a good product  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um did we find any new ideas  
i think uh  
hmm  
yep  
well i have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when i've had use it much it was gone  
but you're not dumping it through <unk> to record it right  
mm-hmm  
and do you think it's  
um and the moment it can't make any differences <unk> i mean you get the same value for every utterance that is exactly or every utterance that is sure  
so  
bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese  
mm-hmm  
um yep nothing here  
the remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible  
so if they want some a soft squishy rubber they can't have the solar powered option  
i'm pretty sure people would buy it  
ten  
yeah i i i i i think that's uh  
that is lovely  
we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway you're not gonna see it at the start  
yeah  
i dunno  
but the titanium they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme so that could be quite interesting  
no  
yeah  
mm 'kay congratulations  
sure that's a good idea  
yeah  
so let's go  
okay so th lyman alpha forest again  
ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost  
yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things  
next next  
<unk> <unk>  
hmm  
just a <unk> marker rather than an actual hesitation  
mm  
exactly  
the more south to th the hole through the water  
we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials but that's sort of what i have in mind  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that's good yeah that a good idea  
g. technologically innovative  
oh right okay  
just yeah  
no  
uh  
but it's not uh fully finished yet  
and it says that i think it said the cost of that isn't too much  
no  
that would be you know that uh that's uh that's something uh you're maybe joking now  
yeah  
yeah it should should do it  
so you have to anticipate the the future  
'kay  
well thirty minutes we have  
so  
we were looking at something fresh something trendy  
mm-hmm  
i know personally when i do <unk> that's what i do and so i had it once  
mm okay but make a <unk> make a sub folder for it because it's starting to fill up already  
sorry  
yeah  
if if you make a <unk> broader bands  
okay  
uh yes course of course it is yeah  
and and then make selections based on a segment  
so i'm looking for a way to  
so that the screen is more  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
in the meantime  
and usually this so to do these functions we need an interface which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that  
components are uh just available in uh  
yeah  
what is that  
'kay  
okay  
sometimes anyway when it works  
i've looked looked at the documentation and <unk> like seen enough to make me think that we want to use the nite x. m. l. framework because um they have a good a event model that <unk> sort of the data and and every display element  
no no no no no  
line  
it's <unk>  
show to the management  
so we could say some kind of low key visitor  
because if there's something that  
we made mm  
up  
yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote  
you've got time when that happens  
yeah  
sorry i missed that  
well can we talk about something else  
yeah  
okay  
is it gonna be a decent source type in the future  
yeah to desi well not not to implement it but to well  
yeah it's this one  
huh  
it looks like yeah  
and we have l. c. d.  
no  
so that yeah  
yeah  
what  
okay  
um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative  
okay okay  
i i between the round of the r.  
yeah  
shall we uh  
sure  
like whatever just uh a triangle moving at the bottom for now or something  
spongy  
you can have it as like a little ball to bounce that flips open  
oh not really but on comment yeah  
okay  
okay  
for the finishing touch  
yeah on on the project uh  
'cause it it seems to me that it's just it sounds like something quite different in in <unk> many aspects  
is this the joystick  
no  
well it's channel on off button volume mute  
but as long as uh it is okay  
just a <unk> just a characteristic of the  
and then uh mike  
no that's okay i got  
yeah i've heard i've seen the bar code design before yeah  
sorry  
so let's let's take it to the next level  
yeah  
yeah  
let's see what if you can come up with anything new  
so would would you have been tempted to put an asterisk after that  
that's why i was thinking <unk> 'cause if you like put up <unk> and it's like a <unk> remote control  
um the chip and of course the infra red bulb so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to  
who has that going  
that's obviously the case  
well i guess so  
of course you know i'm the program manager  
uh so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide or different light bulbs would it be easier  
there's a wire with remote control  
let's let's try and think now how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store  
four buttons at least  
yeah i think there isn't only se most yeah  
yeah maybe for the <unk> if if if it it works well we'll go for uh an orange one  
once you can go down with frequency bands then you will have much uh more <unk> uh complicated data  
then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it  
yep  
<unk> design  
do you think with um  
yeah  
that's what they're getting  
uh  
you see this okay  
yeah  
for the interface uh i think that we can <unk> achieve uh all the desired <unk> by <unk> just uh using uh rubber buttons  
so if we use <unk> solar cells um where is the sun if someone's watching t. v. inside  
yes but i think the the most relevant part is the um the other uh the hardware that <unk> the microphones and that  
yeah see you  
hey  
yeah well it should just have a design  
that's good point  
you know this is it this is what we want  
let's see  
right a number please  
how big do you want the images  
but the idea is maggie and susan are sort of the senior  
fruit and vegetable so mushroom was a kind of you know uh  
and uh the two important ones we're <unk> <unk> forgetting  
maybe we can sell uh all that together so so plastic protection  
yeah but us  
possibly no buttons at all um but if you can incorporate um  
so  
mm mm  
there four microphone  
because you  
hmm  
at the other one we stopped after four metre  
uh  
um you can change some things  
it's original uh trendy and it's user friendly  
okay  
um  
and uh  
or  
give it i would give it a female shape but uh yeah  
if it's below like fifty it's probably or exactly no they're all but one  
is it  
so  
but  
<unk> some new one or  
yes  
well i think when he does re when he does lear these learning experiments he should do 'em two ways  
just put 'em here  
okay  
all these fancy pens  
drop the the special colour and uh do the special colour for the buttons  
so who wants to start  
kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one  
um so yeah without uh going into great details we have a we have a product it has the features and the characteristics and the background  
don't include  
and this is one double line  
yeah of course but yeah you have to make a  
yeah and you just  
if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer  
th thank you  
so uh how about you go first  
um  
and <unk> except by permission of us alright  
but the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options  
or spec spectrum  
okay they're <unk> <unk> prepared  
it's from the company so  
they were supposed to i'm sure  
but maybe you don't need it  
uh what we going to do  
mm-hmm  
well  
then it's okay  
so that's maybe something for the user interface uh designer  
yeah  
and if we devote some energy into this i think the um recent productions of real reaction  
yes  
yeah  
because if we fine tune uh um according to that and it's not finished it's <unk> doesn't make any sense  
will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote  
that's quite significantly expensive  
uh the th the thing that was a bad point was that if you have uh say <unk> i was trying to say if you could evaluate this with search given some keywords like which model would more likely find you a <unk> good document  
oh i see  
three option  
and  
okay so um  
oh yeah  
yeah but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something  
it is a simple c. p. u. but it doesn't  
yeah  
thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control they want something that's easier to use straight away more intuitive perhaps  
it's useful for the remote phone  
okay for the our we'll we we'll uh  
feel the weight  
so  
hmm yes  
<unk> not  
but just talk about the micro quasar  
yep  
yeah red is already a special colour i think  
no matter what we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel according to this  
<unk> a thing  
okay  
okay  
there are a thousand documents  
and then the the hand held bit should be ergonomically designed  
five  
i don't know how well how to with you guys but  
yeah  
how about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control  
yeah  
yeah  
well  
what what would be the difference  
um i think we've decided on what you know decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such  
so how many presentation you you  
i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way but i don't know what they think  
they did it like um i ha i should have found this out  
how how much do we have forty minutes  
and i don't know if <unk> gonna really be a hit  
so the <unk> last one is uh the fire wire acquisition  
mm-hmm  
it has to be original it has to be trendy it has to be user friendly  
i am <unk>  
yeah it's supposed to split it into <unk> coherent topics with the similar information  
but uh the recording has finished  
um  
yeah  
um we've had a lot of kind of input i'd say so far  
okay so the other way  
but there are certain restrictions to certain materials  
we could make two different versions one with and one without  
i really don't think that counts  
which it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market i mean that's where we started from so  
thank you  
so detection latency is about the um it's half of the windows <unk> yeah sliding window  
mm-hmm  
so probably double curved surface is the way to go yeah  
yeah some something like  
so um what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with <unk>  
we asked some uh open ended questions just what are your opinions on the remote control  
right  
and volume control  
okay it's robust yeah  
um this will be the uh agenda for  
i guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that  
because they they just they're just frightened to use the <unk> or help button  
and the l. e. d. of course that's a light emitting diode  
okay  
one  
it's a beautiful animal  
but i think the j. peg the j. peg conversion for the slide capture is done also on the card  
i <unk> you know it's not like person walking  
is it the rubber  
yeah  
exactly  
it's kind of uh not frequency  
yeah  
uh he he knows how it works yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
think most controls are very kind of <unk> ugly  
okay  
like making an underscore making the time or something that wouldn't work  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
and as we say we <unk> we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know  
now the kinetic one we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it  
that's the  
do we only have to to do uh phase one the functional design uh  
<unk>  
i think it's better to have silver nowadays  
yeah i don't know that's probably not very uh nice but would quite easy wouldn't it  
oh  
which i suppose it's that sort of thing like the the symbol on the button  
after and the rest is the same  
just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood  
like like peeling of the banana you <unk>  
mm  
yeah but  
yeah and then i then i would have taken two years extension  
well it was different last year  
well i i was just  
a cross or whatever  
led lights uh that will be distant uh six centimetres between <unk>  
yeah  
but the mai i think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours  
yeah well 'cause i mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying  
there's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things  
yeah  
i think we should have something it  
it was seventy something yeah yeah  
where where is it  
okay  
is it the kinetic energy  
yep  
um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used  
okay  
there's loads of companies that called r. r.  
yeah  
oh of course  
yeah  
yeah  
um  
but it's still there so  
uh well it's the mono  
that's pretty good  
you know we could call like a fruit name but it would be a little more abstract  
okay  
very good  
we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll <unk> those  
almost almost like we are putting different features and i think yeah yeah  
yeah  
see what it looks like  
i. e. e. i. e. okay  
so what is are we supposed to cut things out now  
yeah but <unk> like menu functions or  
and we can also incorporate an l. c. d. display in the remote but this will increase the cost  
this this is it <unk> with the speech recognition  
okay  
mm-hmm  
and well uh what did you find  
sorry to interrupt but we have a warning to finish  
yeah <unk> <unk> what would you uh guys uh think  
no i think this is quite accepted and it's a bit the case  
basically  
mm  
should be very  
how was your business trip to boston  
yep  
i can just add s. s. h. stuff in to <unk> evoke the sound tools on the uh on dice and then copy 'em back  
finish meeting now  
i <unk> if we want to show noise setting it's you have to show on aurora also like aurora is real time  
luckily  
yeah  
mm  
do we need a long life battery  
like that initially had quite different ideas about the phrase types and and <unk> and then eventually you came up uh with some kind of rules that you set up between uh the two of you  
can't we uh  
no my um yeah what my um t. f. i. d. f. is based on <unk> data  
because it really seems to me that you know if you look at and some of this stuff on exchange is like ancient and you know  
okay  
on  
yeah  
yeah  
um shall i just load it with <unk> data just to see a different where's the  
mm  
yeah  
well so it's point four  
<unk> why do you care whether they can do it just based on the the language  
okay  
yeah  
'kay have we found any new ideas through this process  
and maybe uh relative to some other comparable departments  
yeah so there's there is a one battery because most remotes use two batteries i believe  
alright  
okay well i mean  
oh  
it's a lump  
well our functional design meeting that's the stage we're in  
so monday the seventh is the title  
uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you  
yes but you had a picture of it from another company  
i think you gotta <unk> get into cost effectiveness  
i think the look is better but the feel is is is worse  
oh  
okay  
and then the p. in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle  
thank you guys  
oops  
okay  
if you have a certain number of words on your slides you need a certain amount of time to read them  
that's what marius did no like  
uh this uh american figures  
i mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing what are your thoughts on that  
okay  
round  
oh yeah  
uh <unk> either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case  
so a swing to the left a swing to the right defines other functions  
for example a sliding or rolling uh uh <unk> uh stuff if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb  
i'm done  
well and that's an important part for you then with <unk> regards to the user friendly part of it  
green wood brown  
that was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting  
huh  
okay now i think for this one i could would you guys prefer use the <unk> or <unk> maybe i'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it  
so <unk> that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the l. c. d.  
right  
and to come back on the the swapping uh things uh i don't think uh i i think the younger will be most interest in it  
but it's again a little bit different because they are i they are doing this in a frequency domain  
making it last  
yeah just know where  
so what's the difference between  
that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in but the designers thought they were great  
takes takes seconds  
we aren't doing emission line objects  
um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on  
right uh see you in thirty minutes then  
uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh i'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it  
and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
again  
i <unk> was just wondering if there's some <unk> someone was doing it with speech as well  
am i right  
we can just run some generic yeah  
okay  
yeah the lower the the lower the score the better right  
there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web  
okay so um this we had this we had  
well i think guillermo was thinking about  
hello  
yes but uh or in our discussion we haven't mentioned uh it was assumed there'd be a voice over  
and we don't have to buy that  
but  
well maybe we need specific <unk> then  
if we do i do we need an advanced chip or is it okay <unk>  
but that wouldn't work because it needs the word because that's all it's working on  
seven  
yep  
you can't uh draw easy in in <unk>  
no a colour everyone accepts  
yeah  
i don't think i was fully paying attention to that  
yep  
huh  
hmm  
okay  
um  
and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach  
um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um but  
but then uh it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh  
okay so if you have some question i didn't answer  
we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or so you could put that on a t. v. for example  
i think uh <unk> one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with  
yeah  
no of course  
because then people have to well like if the cell is out of bat yeah to mo yeah  
uh but still uh i i i there is uh it takes <unk> more work and but i yeah yeah i mean it's good good point  
yeah  
that's uh something you uh have to take a look at  
so it's just the uh the ascii file the things like the mouse movements and things like that  
you say you double click on the  
yeah i think it's  
like <unk> five different  
you never know if it's the data is there then  
in my opinion uh the first feature is just to be easy to use  
so another missed false start  
so you can change any colour you want  
check here  
so this is the easiest design the there could be  
well uh what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls and um i viewed how how they <unk> looked  
well many people place with tandem right like m. i. t. or who is using that some not m. i. t. but somebody  
yeah <unk> even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous  
yeah be you know so it doesn't ruin the polarity  
that this will be a crux  
like this  
yeah so if uh if something like that can be incorporated some kind of  
you don't want uh because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use  
uh uh  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
it was good  
the the layout of the remote control  
mm-hmm  
um it would be nice but like just  
okay  
i <unk> imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks  
yes rather than the uh the the traditional in fact um i won't even go that far  
yeah i think um we could do <unk> the logo in grey as it is on the website  
so  
a small one  
it's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options  
so for for every utterance sort of like the utterance has a speaker and a weight which is coming from outside  
yeah i have actually yeah the we can see the report here and the demo  
uh  
mm-hmm  
right  
okay so all you're gonna have to do is swap in tag names later  
oh  
yeah  
because i i  
mm-hmm  
yeah so <unk> that's the first thing th that thing when i spoke to you about this  
but i think you need to keep in mind that the <unk> are just extra light  
<unk> what's the default colour  
two  
so they haven't <unk> okay  
<unk> you could you could when it's when you're doing a search  
thank you  
so this kind of uh interaction might be better <unk> as monologue which uh in which there is interaction i suppose  
stable thing that's right  
'cause you can talk to it like this  
and the menu button does also does the okay function then  
you can by using the  
yeah should be there but not press yeah sub menu yeah  
i'll get get working on the <unk> stuff this week and then so once uh once uh once we've got some some idea about what analysis you want out of this  
yeah yeah  
we put we put fashion into  
uh well i don't remember being asked for an induction  
yeah  
young people love them  
it's now it's just extra to illustrate <unk> uh extra features but okay  
yeah sure  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
no i keep the re yeah  
that's huge  
ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that  
and there was a vowel in there but you noticed that she just used the and that's fine  
oh yeah you have to promise to tell us how that is  
mm  
uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that  
and then you can <unk>  
yes  
but it was one third of the time  
everyone's kind of done it as a cop out then we might have to sort of say to them well you know  
so if with location all you can do is extract segments of speech for example but it will not tell you that these are the same person  
uh yeah  
okay so you have the <unk> the pitch and you have information about the voice dynamic or  
if you if you're using it keep it  
so you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber  
it's all about cool things  
so it requires the use of l. c. d. probably to to tell you  
and some of the extra <unk>  
maybe just start typing  
up  
hidden in  
yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it  
i already noted that  
yeah  
yeah  
we want it  
but uh you you mentioned that another side of your project is also to <unk> off line  
it's kind of fascinating wasn't it  
and everything else can be yeah <unk> yeah sure  
mm-hmm  
this is uh it's an interesting idea and i think i it looks pretty cool  
nope  
um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people  
oh the thing we forgot was like a mute button  
mm-hmm  
um i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on <unk> to get this working so  
uh but i i couldn't get no one knew where is it what it is where it happens and why and so forth  
yes  
do we go for maybe a remote <unk> uh sorry we're gonna go for a remote control obviously  
this is the sub band time signal  
'cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables  
okay  
and when you push the button it will uh will be sent to the chip  
i think we have uh a few functions and we can put uh the l. c. d. above it  
yeah that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources i think  
yep that's fine  
that's what i'm not clear on  
well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the <unk> existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer  
<unk> but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know  
okay this is between both  
something like this because the <unk> could be good for the <unk> to know what was the chosen framing by this extraction  
i mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels i mean would anybody disagree with that  
and so the method is that the design team makes a prototype and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated  
mm right  
a microphone maybe  
i'd ignore that  
no seven is false and one is true  
first we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective  
this is the most mostly used  
instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro controller  
you press this and it does th  
that's one of the big issues  
yeah  
and uh yeah infrared might be an issue  
so if we try and really <unk> on that i think that'll be in our <unk>  
um so that would work  
we can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand by  
no <unk> <unk> <unk> but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and <unk> thing  
white backlight and dark  
the shape thing is solved  
so it's something that you yeah as jean marc said is christmas and uh so we're happy with the christmas gift  
so  
you can we can announce now  
yeah um if you write wrote anything down uh could you put it on the shared folder  
we will try to guess what it is  
oh oh oh i'll make a note of that kate  
so so you won't say that the l. p. c. is not able to fit it so that the residual was easy  
mm  
so for the power source apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries  
sounds good  
i think it should stay  
okay  
because of this product uh this technology has already been developed  
pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control  
at least for uh because they're also working with uh maybe more complex documents with images and text and so on  
it has to be easy to use also or things  
okay  
yeah  
what about the touch <unk> touch screen  
yes um i have some technical uh issues which i would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion  
but if it is more on the um the slide information is not going to help you  
so you will propose us something which is  
well it it they were clearly talking about a product  
the circuit board that we need to consider where we'll be getting them from what they'll be made of  
then it wouldn't it probably wouldn't be able to use it would be able to use the same reception on the remote <unk> control i guess  
i  
or  
because it may be the design uh it's uh maybe it is a bit of the  
yep  
ha  
also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them not just that so  
<unk>  
okay  
i was adding that that's what i was doing  
well now you can shake your remote control  
so i don't think it would effect our circuit board  
so in this case it will be uh similar to hybrid method  
oh  
the most there are only seven buttons  
alright you won't yeah  
okay  
okay  
<unk> move the the actual device and this <unk> uh provides it with with uh some energy  
i feel like i'm signing off  
maybe not but <unk>  
so yeah i've  
i see i see i see  
yeah  
it was lovely meeting you all  
alright  
no you can do two because um it can be easier  
we're <unk> no but we're we'll have to look into that  
yeah single curve  
too  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it takes maybe years and again uh it definitely like who will who will choose the ten papers like and if we asked yeah  
mm-hmm  
but  
<unk> whatever  
the germans don't yeah yeah yeah  
and it's not too complex to do it  
okay  
and i mean it  
sebastian has everything  
i i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now  
how we could have a an alarm system so that people can find it  
which i think technically is just push button and uh i'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on  
i'm kidding  
mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum  
<unk> well we have to go through it  
yeah  
more likely  
aye  
what you think might be uh a useful uh new feature  
no but if if like this i'll i'll point it out  
for  
yes  
<unk>  
or  
right  
uh dual channel  
not a seven for this  
but uh that it's uh here then in the middle  
and then have uh different covers uh to use  
and as well as that  
here you see uh some results uh and how uh how what is the effect of introducing uh reasonable prior knowledge  
yeah  
i i i have a tendency to agree with you  
so for one band we more or less have <unk> like <unk> one hundred bits per second  
they were fine  
it's about the practicality of it really isn't it  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah it's  
um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push button kind of like a modern a bit bulky  
point three  
okay  
well one thing uh one one thing that <unk> can do you can have little videos when other haven't gotten got any cameras for doing that  
yeah sure but i mean that's transmission delay not <unk> delay  
or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly  
<unk>  
will be fine  
every page is linked eventually to everything else so it every page has information incorporated in it  
uh basically the time you're mentioning is this value  
and then the teamwork i think i think it worked quite quite nicely yeah  
so  
mm  
i think uh it's the sensors  
looks nice and it's easy easy to use easy to use  
so opening  
okay  
i see  
yeah  
what is the teletext  
um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it  
it'll be the bit where it creates the clock  
um okay but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software  
yeah  
thank you  
it could and then you could actually <unk> put the banana shaped thing on the fruit bowl  
but that's what makes it uh original though isn't it  
right  
so uh this is uh a simple solution but um where we don't have to care about the <unk>  
so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want  
yeah  
yeah this is double curve no  
no  
you can see it also on the on the on the side view that only this part is the front  
of course it has a shape but i i  
but maybe the bit rate is the problem no  
okay  
one  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
would you like the the buttons horizontal or <unk> vertical  
but now i understand better that <unk> wants this kind of method to help them to restore and to apply the <unk> some algorithms to to to make a better movie  
interesting  
yes  
does it  
tried  
mm-hmm  
um  
i think it's easier to use than a regular remote control because when you push on the options menu  
now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back okay  
right  
so uh we're gonna turn that around  
yeah  
that's uh  
that's a one  
uh evaluation  
yeah  
that's what they're trying to say  
hmm  
oh right  
run run run what exactly  
rather hard  
that seems fine yeah  
yeah  
that's a bit uh  
strange  
hmm  
okay  
okay  
hard plastic uh the shape and around it hard uh around it rubber  
mm-hmm  
but  
star fruit  
no that doesn't make any sense  
um i don't know when people will um be moving a remote around a lot  
uh let's see  
okay  
mm  
good  
so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is  
yeah  
yeah  
to some extent we would like to extract some elements of the layout to <unk> to have a more high analysis  
well that's right i mean th this this slide here i mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity  
oh right okay  
actually of the of all these i personally <unk> prefer this one  
your lapel <unk> fallen off  
that <unk>  
happy to meet you  
yeah  
you've got like your <unk> your parent construct and the parts that it's constructed out of  
<unk> the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or  
thank you  
but uh  
and uh it it'll be uh you know prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um  
i don't know  
uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality  
hmm  
oh we can just make four push buttons in a form of a round  
no minus one or something  
mm  
hey  
yeah  
uh yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
hmm  
very long presentation  
yeah one big curve i guess you could say  
yeah  
yeah  
twenty five euros  
but i <unk> would hope that's on the work package six web site as well  
okay right  
so we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front  
okay  
so uh i uh did he get his data in  
oh in it is okay yeah  
yeah  
maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens like  
'cause it you can't get it curved  
that's fair enough yeah  
yeah  
uh the first one this scale from sixteen to forty five age  
mm  
okay speech  
yeah  
can we <unk> can we do that without uh changing it twelve fifty per product if we basically can sell more based on this  
but we're not supposed to mark things we've done differently  
mm  
oh it's graduate for graduates  
so will will will this with uh including all possible things so buttons wheel and the chip be uh lower than twelve euros to produce  
more yeah  
yeah participant two um  
what the user wants uh  
it's gonna be twenty five euro remember so um it has to be <unk> marketable to um whomever it is  
and i had the talk on a laptop in front of me and they had the talk on their laptops  
uh i'll i'll change it i'll make it <unk> my my mark will be a four  
three  
well are we talking about on each colour combination or are we you know we'll like we'll have yellow and black  
okay  
yeah  
you know what's steep and what's shallow  
yeah  
um the design has to fit the hand be original but also be familiar  
you can see  
so if it's in the dark place you still see it glowing  
'kay  
yeah it is connected  
yeah okay 'cause  
yeah  
well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones  
well it's it's definitely the obvious choice with the colour of our company  
okay now mm-hmm  
no  
we make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately  
well i th i think mike mike has a point  
uh a <unk> a a cover made in uh in china it it won't be i guess so expensive i think  
so you can see that like somebody speaking and so and so before the <unk> before the shot you can see that usually there are like ninety percent of the points at least  
yeah  
so to find the shape uh of the table to get uh who the and put that uh on the um on table uh legs  
yeah  
well the yeah the the yeah the the the the jack that is that it's plugged into is stereo  
well  
i'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view  
like we're to in our twelve euros or around that  
okay  
but is it uh can you just buy it on the market and <unk> plug it in or you want to ma  
yes  
like what is our target audience what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
it's too long  
okay p. a. s.  
but uh the case  
like it's really uh yeah yeah yeah  
i'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape  
yeah 'cause there were all these issues about how you calculate eye eye lag and you know  
sure  
here  
th there is one frequency that is the base from for uh  
yeah  
if you could uh speed it up a bit please yeah  
was it not possible to uh send emails around the office  
i don't see why it'd be any more massive than the file  
you can draw it if you want  
the young people want uh a trendy uh remote control  
<unk> you're expecting me to remember stuff aren't you  
what have do we have to do  
well from experience um i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small  
you have to code it uh directly to the machine  
sony ericsson mobile phones has it  
okay  
but  
he's the industrial designer  
alright  
well it isn't but maybe that thing is uh is  
yeah it's <unk> actually six what is it  
uh i guess you all know what is it about you all received the email i guess  
<unk> right right  
alright how were our means  
and the device r. s. i. sensitive  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so that would be the series as a whole  
um i mean there are like i say the the the main things people do with a t. v. remote control is the volume and the channel  
oh  
yeah  
so we use a normal battery  
uh yes it was something that had to be defined and the uh dutch lot didn't  
course not  
they said they needed it but what does it do  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
mm mm  
yeah <unk> <unk> power supply is one of the most important things  
uh yes the the i take the the <unk> i <unk> when i go up to the the curve uh i'm uh on the at the local maximum  
but this is in time domain more or less  
are you are you all done  
okay  
of course uh it has to be  
okay well you you can go from double curved to single curved  
okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh <unk> or this is  
then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it that was <unk> quite a <unk> substantial size sort of standing up  
yeah i mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey you know whether  
maybe  
how many <unk> functions can it uh have  
mm-hmm  
okay so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design <unk> and then detailed design  
um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the d. v. d. and v. c. r. access and stuff  
um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well we'll see later  
then it's  
every home's got to have it  
material and stuff  
uh was it voice activated um  
and something to fidget with  
yeah  
it's what you should be using for this type of task  
'cause like you say it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for  
but just like the variance of f. zero within a certain time frame and like sort of like just have some part for its very low variance with more the same f. zero and one where there's a lot of more variance  
so are we marking h. two and h. two regions for example  
so that might be an idea of using the rubber but then it should you know yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i know  
yeah  
um i dunno if it's it's creative  
thing is like that it's not going anywhere particularly  
yeah it <unk> oh well some of them point to the words other others point to the um dialogue acts  
you mean  
okay cool  
and then  
so right now our practical solution is to have one uh microphone close to um every place where people are supposed to sit  
li uh a <unk> ad uh electronic uh  
really  
so the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original  
we have to check them with <unk> and j. p. that they like the representation the variables right  
okay  
that's a very <unk> pretty cat  
but then i think you  
and uh i drew an example but it did not work quite the well uh the way i wanted it to do  
yep  
okay  
because it it does have sort of sum of angles and things  
um we have push button interface so that's inexpensive  
that's what i guess  
uh but  
right  
um  
which was fine  
mm  
or or how was it affected by packet loss and and and things like that  
i mean they are pretty much artificial  
i'm not quite sure if they're i don't think they mean point five euros per button  
oh no too much concept  
'kay  
yeah  
but i do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have  
okay  
yeah  
and you always grab the wrong one because <unk> of the buttons is exactly the same only the labels are different  
yes  
yeah  
did you really  
okay  
that's probably stupid but uh as i found here uh fifty percent was it fifty  
yeah  
it'll just apply some default style sheet to it anyway that shows you  
just go on  
oh sorry i'm i'm interrupting you  
to say mm-hmm  
mm  
no let's see  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh-huh  
for the volume  
'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand maybe it won't work so well  
to express them mm mm no  
well if it is going to be just a t. v. remote control it is going to be very simple  
uh he's very famous i think for that right  
yeah right  
the <unk> the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control  
mm  
wouldn't you have all of it  
yeah that's right but  
right yeah  
was it  
yeah  
um buttons for buttons we have um <unk> which is what real reaction uses the most often  
so which vegetable  
yeah  
like it's information  
uh  
i would propose this concept for design just few buttons a screen with a back light which can change colours titanium  
the gym  
and uh  
so  
sorry  
mm  
mm  
no don't buy our product because we are <unk> we like this only  
they won't hurt you  
yeah i know but you have to name a fig uh a number  
three  
ooh  
you know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things so i think we're definitely on the good bit  
so we might consider l. c. d. screens  
um i like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do <unk> uh swim in groups so  
so side  
i think we've all managed to master the <unk> there by looks of it so on to it  
oh yeah  
yeah  
good morning  
i had so much information and so much to talk about  
nothing it's right i'm just  
yeah  
select a  
<unk> would for example enable you i think to um um connect for example you if you get a <unk> call on your mobile phone  
do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty <unk> five as we probably could  
<unk> using which tool are you talking about  
like the m. p. three player  
on our nice <unk> um a little uh idea of yeah  
oh  
it's  
mm  
and uh  
<unk> <unk> yeah <unk> five is  
no no they were uh mine yeah  
yeah uh that's a possibility but  
the rubber is  
well it's also fancy then  
uh-huh  
uh so that's my recommendation if you use many options in one <unk> button  
so the question is still open about the l. c. d. thing  
i haven't come to here but  
mm-hmm  
that's just zero  
yeah i agree  
also elephants have a very good memory much like myself  
yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me  
the remote control has built in games  
i'm not sure that i've got any favourite animal to be quite honest i think homo <unk> because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh  
the originality um is gonna take all of us  
me too  
we don't have the money to do it towards <unk> <unk> technology so we should we should aim at design  
yeah that's not a cheap thing to get  
mm-hmm  
ooh  
yeah yeah  
this is what we which you can mm  
you know a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that  
okay  
in the market the people are not really interested with l. c. d. without l. c. d. with speech recognition interface or without speech recognition interface  
yeah  
um  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay you end up with  
bye  
the user interface itself  
the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control such as voice recognition  
and the uh the hand shape is also rubber  
okay  
if 'cause if it i let's say i mean if if their query language is strange and if it would return <unk> ten million results and it can't handle it  
yeah sure you're right  
we look at the age group of forty plus  
yeah yeah i remember  
it's probability yeah  
mm-hmm  
so this so this is somebody saying it it doesn't  
yeah  
where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were <unk> uh bright and <unk> and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels  
but for this  
i think so  
the so the sound the sound the <unk>  
is everyone ready to start  
yeah well yeah but it's it's a bit long  
hmm  
but  
so i guess what one of the questions is how important is the reading room to your group really  
i think not  
i mean this were the points which we got from the market demands  
with one you will only get direction  
marketing  
that's what i got uh to hear  
but well uh i we said uh no i <unk> th think two because this and this and then you can react uh on it  
uh numbers present  
yeah  
you would though 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes  
but i don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example  
or if we just do the usual button thing  
mm  
oh  
because the whole programme works on them being numbered at the moment  
yeah thank you for your work and  
because they will pay outrageous cash to  
yeah  
okay  
alright  
it's like that's one the papers i read  
but if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning then you're paying a bit more attention  
finger grips just on top of the plastic  
but non vegetarian  
project documents yeah it's on your desktop as well  
because at a certain point it's a matter of time  
well  
when you say from this shot to this shot is using a graphical user interface someone who would do manually for each video  
well you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers because lot of things we came up with  
yeah but uh you said yeah <unk> yeah but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making  
yeah but the parameters which are exact  
okay  
i think we should contact management  
which is  
and to get a feeling for what it is uh here is an image of it  
on <unk> on what  
or <unk> yeah they could just be oscillating mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm  
discuss it in the next meeting  
mm uh  
yeah because you haven't actually listed explicitly um that you're not going to include it  
okay  
i <unk> yeah  
<unk>  
say this is this this is this this is this this is this and when he would receive the d. v. d.  
mm-hmm  
the c. v. s.  
that's it  
um for the topic segments  
and  
so i think that's another thing that has to be pulled into this because um you you do require different uh uh different kinds of relations  
okay  
the other thing is is the left hand one protruding  
oh  
yeah  
um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation i think  
yeah  
<unk> it's true  
mm  
yeah i think that's the idea it just loads the particular ones it needs  
okay well i think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working  
yeah  
so um for the uh a case there's uh the traditional <unk> flat hard case  
or we could even replace them by buttons actually  
mm-hmm  
we chose a different type of colour for the menu  
yeah and  
next slide  
okay  
'kay  
seven is good yeah isn't it  
ooh  
yeah  
hmm  
i don't  
but only th yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
so we are agree with the banana thing  
yeah may maybe because you're  
is it for uh for putting a for logos no  
it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand  
it's it's plugged in  
yeah okay  
well <unk> then start  
i mean this this ain't titanium but it looks like it  
um then if they need internet then we would be able to to <unk> to propose something with uh uh t. v. over i. p.  
so uh <unk> i mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information is it  
as one okay  
alright and supplements  
mm-hmm  
if you turn it a little  
what do you have in short cut  
um and no teletext  
well we don't really know what the difference is right  
yeah yeah because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands which are really good  
the better it'll sell  
you have any more questions about this  
ah okay it's pretty  
mm-hmm  
right right  
well it doesn't look much fancy i'll i'll say three or four  
hmm  
yeah  
um i think it's uh yeah i think it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product  
oh michael hi  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
um to be honest actually i mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time  
um incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer  
does it have legs  
i i agree with uh this uh  
so it's the number of <unk> the did you want the you  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
this thing  
but as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand  
oh yeah  
um and that it <unk> it should just always work whenever you uh um  
<unk> is kind of closed set ma even if there's lots of outside links but there's lots of inside links  
yeah so yeah for uh <unk> uh the discourse analysis they're using exchange  
well it's convenient for the user  
so we put the fashion in electronics  
yeah maybe that's good idea yeah  
you're sure there's not a better solution that involves  
cost  
cheap  
agenda  
yeah i don't see why not as long as you're you know doing your given set of hours for the week  
um so first before starting i <unk> just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting  
well uh yeah i i still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top so yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
it is  
so the point is that when you take device and push the button you produce enough energy  
yeah  
an yes  
so  
i agree  
not  
yeah if you want  
okay  
okay  
oh really  
also in in height  
hey  
because then we can easily <unk> display them individually <unk> contrast them to each other and play around with how <unk> to combine them  
yeah sure  
mm-hmm  
well for a remote control do you think that will be i suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is  
you know you've <unk> everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments um and then come together and worked in  
would you be able to find out which word that is and  
i like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff  
i think that's the point what uh  
but but not <unk> prepare  
maybe pear yeah or something like that  
say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them or have an l. c. d. screen and so on so on  
mm-hmm  
but i think for any kind of way you have to select those alpha you you have to look at the effect on on the re on the <unk> evaluation task  
mm-hmm  
now you shouldn't say the wrong thing i dunno  
okay  
it's so cute  
this this is a yes this is our presentation of the prototype  
okay  
um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push buttons  
yes  
you you you're using buttons this way or if you're right handed this way  
but um ones ones you ones that actually had turn up into parts list uh it creates a closed polygon by linking the <unk> end point to the start point  
i should definitely now we had a debate about this before and i can't remember why i decided to mark associated  
we should go with that concept i think  
<unk> someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design  
yeah  
do people use that often  
yeah  
two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else um <unk> we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing  
oh <unk> god we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go  
and we save that to d. v. recorder  
and i'm last  
no  
maybe i i don't want to i don't want to suppress you but <unk> i'll uh finish this uh quick  
and electrical cables copper is all pretty basic stuff  
'kay  
galactic black hole candidates  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
so um  
i don't think the special form is really true  
yeah  
just tap somewhere  
uh  
i don't know  
'cause then they learn the first time  
yeah  
and for the marketing uh  
i wouldn't i think now probably  
yeah and it's kind of crappy  
um i th myself voice recognition kind of scares me off  
mm-hmm  
yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can once we find out um  
doesn't matter  
or the other way around that you could show but <unk>  
okay  
and flash takes up a lot of batteries again  
uh soft material  
yeah  
thanks  
so if it turns out that it's idiosyncratic in some way that teaches you funny habits then it won't have been a good idea  
so if that's your thing and you got something like that instead and there's your <unk> you <unk> you know which way you're gonna pointing it  
but oh  
yeah the lower part doesn't work i guess so maybe you should try it over there  
but it doesn't tell you which clustering better represents the pages necessarily  
yeah  
if you if you're given the choice between a <unk> a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to <unk> make because as far as i understand it  
alright  
um your first ideas about um creating a new <unk> remote control  
mm yeah  
so it's not perfect  
is the material attractive  
to sell  
so i'm going to go and use the <unk> and i've made a list of criteria to look at  
okay um let's just assume we go to forty one  
mm-hmm  
with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana  
okay yeah  
okay  
we should move to uh something  
<unk> yes but so i mean the relation names it's not the names that are important it's their semantics that are important right  
i think current t. v. <unk> can even send infrared  
uh 'kay  
the <unk> is quite quick  
an  
got decisions to make there  
<unk> just an idea  
okay  
you can you can i it it i  
uh because if you change to <unk> channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your l. c. d. screen  
i got like one email after ten minutes or something  
oh yeah yeah  
what i <unk> what i was thinking about uh the the the <unk> uh about uh the sender and the receiver  
and what else was i gonna say  
then like the big thing we probably shouldn't do by email  
if you want audio if you want visual then you have those  
and we don't like that one  
uh  
should i press it again  
so are we gonna make this part of the furniture  
and uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations  
so far it's just a general statement of interest what we intend to do  
yeah i mean we that's we we  
yeah  
i mean <unk> my wife at the moment for instance is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally  
uh then uh then what  
it's question  
so the joystick is just for <unk>  
yep  
you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that  
yeah  
yeah i think it's a disadvantage  
should we save this picture or or you know what it looks like  
yeah i mean  
mm-hmm  
mm  
maybe a a cheap voice recording  
okay yeah that's right  
we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about  
select all  
if it isn't uh manageable uh budget wise we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons  
yeah  
you <unk> you know if there's one there or not you could say that's that  
okay do it  
okay groovy  
but i th yeah but i think the l. c. d. display is kind of yeah  
we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip but then we can't have the the speech recognition yes  
but uh it can be in uh maybe in an a <unk> version but  
that  
so the first criteria  
and if i did it again i'd say a slight depression of the continuum and possibly well  
that's probably true yeah  
mm  
hmm  
they  
and uh uh we put that in i thought it would be handy there  
and then not yeah  
we re use the um midi signal  
yeah i'll give it a one  
yeah  
yeah  
okay so uh the first thing uh i have done is to to made a review together with the uh <unk> uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control  
and we can decide if that's what we want um if we want to include that on the remote  
i was like 'cause i saw you <unk> i saw you looking at your watch before and i like wow  
so then you have double double curved in some way  
so i will ask you all to do the same  
break the stem off  
yeah  
but maybe <unk> respect to slides and the rest is not is something that may be tolerable  
yeah  
there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip  
yeah  
uh  
yeah  
uh so we have sound yeah  
i hope  
mm-hmm  
okay  
weak this is a kind of weak interactivity  
<unk> especially <unk> when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product we'll be fine  
you have the basic colours blue green red  
maybe like uh a folding ledge or something  
<unk> demo one  
sure  
yeah  
um but that's that's good  
you don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um  
um i dunno what zapping is but  
well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway  
yeah yeah  
i have no idea either  
and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker then maybe the range should be uh  
oh it's that's a that's a good idea  
uh yeah we're finished  
that's it  
okay  
so without th further ado whoever wants to go first is free to  
if you if you already have you have in the right order all the words with a with a score to them  
mm-hmm  
well we'll see if elan likes it or not  
mm-hmm  
probably not  
i can put all the system back here  
yeah  
i think it's  
right so there's your limit  
yeah can we do can we do something better than that  
so we're gonna use the simple chip  
ah okay  
shall we uh make a new uh  
there are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how <unk> how do you <unk> is is <unk>  
yeah 'cause otherwise you could end up putting a hyphen after every hesitation mark that you have  
<unk> h. p. h. p.  
you can see it  
yeah  
you co you could make it always black like normal remote  
alright okay so tool training  
but i don't care  
mm  
yeah  
anyone  
one okay  
yeah  
what would be the <unk> difference between detecting the average or detecting the maximum  
that that that's not a problem  
and john's going  
well you can make it in a file if you want  
yeah clear that'd be  
that's true  
well we understand  
yeah also  
the excuse me  
mm-hmm  
that's right  
did you manage  
evaluation  
yeah i mean it's people say that it's the look they want the fancy looking thing but i'm  
right  
hmm  
so we'll go for the battery  
yeah  
i don't know  
and then there is that hilbert carrier  
in the text  
oh no  
is that what we're we're doing  
i'm not sure  
yeah  
i mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it  
i have to check out how far i can go with that  
two  
so it has to be very robust  
yeah and then  
mm  
autumn colours like red brown  
poor man's solution is probably gonna be to have a a list  
maybe it  
i mean i'm i'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do able isn't it  
well geneva that's why i'm here at <unk> because i attended geneva <unk>  
um i don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not the single curved and double curved  
yeah  
what we are uh we might see it uh in very simple way that we are using some hilbert transform <unk> at the beginning to create analytic signal  
uh our users they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls  
expensive  
but right now you the thing is that right now you know almost what is the uh like the which will give you the best is also you can <unk> instead of running it hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah well  
we call that one the <unk> uh the <unk>  
oh right  
yeah  
just to cover those moments when for whatever reason the remote hasn't been exposed to  
and uh i think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone  
and <unk> asked me what to do in the case of an utterance just consisting of laughter  
um i don't know what you mean by that  
but we don't  
say about a three maybe  
okay do you need the cord back  
uh sum over all the links into z. of page rank  
okay  
this the front won't be as thick but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh  
yeah  
okay  
i'd say two as well  
is that part of both of them or  
yeah like that's gonna work  
l. c. d.  
oh the project manager  
okay  
i dunno  
oh no  
but you know not that i but you know the kinds of things where people to try to represent argument structure  
yeah probably that actually true that if you're doing a search you're usually not interested in a condensed way but in the in the full thing anyway  
yes exactly like it  
yeah that's true  
interesting  
but it feels more comfortable <unk> what you call upside down  
okay  
examples  
yes  
maybe the buttons could like uh  
yeah it should be easy to do yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
twenty five euros is the selling price we really have to innovate here i guess  
um how the user interface might work  
yeah it was it was pretty scary but let's see what happens  
apparently i'm old as well  
they're just simple t. v. remote controls  
here i'll just  
true  
okay okay  
mm  
fine  
but i have the feeling i in  
and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases  
but if you <unk> if you could scroll through the channels and then the volume would just be  
oh that's true  
yeah  
no  
yes okay  
yeah  
um it <unk> it'd probably select it yeah  
gaze tracking is still  
did we in the end  
well we can just say  
um you know functional so it's useful but minimalist  
ah  
two or three  
and then steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user friendly keys that were easy to use  
then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people yeah  
being able to switch between them there may be stereo v. c. r. and t. v.  
yeah  
um  
and <unk> wait <unk> what are the strawberries for  
but i do like <unk> go figure  
lunch break  
wait  
um it it's basically the it's the standard entropy formula  
is it better  
no definitely not  
i thought i forgot something but uh  
this an explanation of the smart boards  
for the speech recognition  
you assume you want a democratic <unk> vote right  
which i think is a good thing  
it's gonna be making sure that it fits what you expect out of the format  
you i mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones  
so this one and this one  
<unk> you read that stuff since you wrote it  
well  
well <unk> yeah  
that you that it would be kind of shape like this you know  
i would say seven  
huh  
yep  
number seven  
it has to be kind of instead of the playstation the module  
um well <unk> maybe i can ask it right now the question that i have  
rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better  
mm  
mm  
yeah if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money if we don't have to  
well we'll <unk> yeah well with the yeah <unk> well thing is that we we still have the x. wa the x. wave traces from the ascii formats  
yes of course  
anyway it should it it's supposed to be a dolphin you like the freedom that it that it represents  
yeah it could be whatever as long as there's something big in the middle because like the old phones  
yeah  
but you know here we can easily have a fire because the everything is made of wood i think and it's small and  
if i press the six it'll go to channel six  
mm  
and so <unk> okay  
um  
<unk>  
sorry  
oh right  
all i need is mic  
hmm  
um moving on to the printed <unk>  
very good  
what  
so i have to make sure that that that uh they need to know something that uh so feel free basically to stop by any time and um yeah and uh it's not that i know everything  
okay um moving on to  
oh and the tail  
isn't  
like you have the menu button in between uh  
uh-huh  
okay  
<unk> and we're all using twenty seven so  
but then what i say the costs will uh get a lot higher  
okay  
i mean so i mean we have to think about how <unk> <unk> interacts with the automatic segmentation you know  
um it's a bit different just a little bit more of a creative feel  
okay  
we wanted to provide um that in an extra list saying probably agreement  
just kind of the squishy feel  
we will omit the touch screen in <unk> of voice recognition  
yep  
uh that sounds  
two thirty  
are there any questions for clarification of <unk> before we go on to the next one  
um so if you touch the button it kind of <unk> it  
mm  
check your email  
okay  
um obviously i don't think that's real sized  
you got a lot of room here  
my favourite animal huh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm mm-hmm yeah  
yeah yeah not too flashy  
yeah  
mm  
i was going to uh say nasty words but i don't  
yeah i'm also a bit <unk> like i'm not a hundred percent sure about rainbow being the right thing  
i just think that uh possibly mm  
i yeah plus that and then you <unk> between them so you say alpha and one minus alpha  
for example  
yeah um so to <unk> what are your <unk> words about play doh  
yeah  
here  
yeah  
sinusoidal coding  
i'm not actually a hundred percent sure what it's called but the display has some method where you tell it where to start and where to end  
well if you were cockney then sorry  
right  
yeah  
you'll be uh finished sooner  
we brought up the idea of having two pieces which we could discuss further  
uh <unk> no  
right  
you can make uh suggestions uh if you want  
it well thing is that the a. the a. well the a. p. i. is standardized by the w. three c.  
that's easy  
mm  
okay okay  
and mute  
yeah maybe  
okay let's get started  
they won't use it  
yeah  
yep  
um we have um got some push buttons as well  
no definitely not  
no i think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half  
so <unk> we'll start with l. c. d.  
yeah  
yeah  
with respect to frame dropping right  
no  
okay  
but you know the the <unk> the interesting  
yeah i dunno  
yes  
um that i don't think is a a serious problem  
like something like that or so or so  
yeah they might be blurred with uh silence  
and i could talk to the t. v. television itself  
that's quite a distinctive shape that would be good wouldn't it  
yeah but  
i al i i've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time so well the managers were terrible  
yeah  
it's it's usually uh there but  
i'm sure she'll have views on it  
oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product  
um  
stories and numbers or  
and you  
of course yeah  
yeah but i uh  
that's kinda cool actually  
different  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so we made them a bit bigger  
if you explain it to us it'll be fine  
are you happy with that  
but a coffee machine there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary  
so seven seven six  
mm  
and also maybe like this noise is he was  
yeah  
yeah but it was because we didn't uh yeah  
this uh project where by um twenty five euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price  
yeah yeah  
but it's not related to speech recognition so much or but  
oops no  
you agree okay  
and those segments have uh do they have an i. d.  
'cause you get that immediate benefit that you don't have any insertion errors  
computer adjusting  
yeah  
and then it happens that some of them have been clustered  
you showed us you <unk> you you prepare something for us  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
because we need to go on in for the time  
region systems  
because the two are so close together that their regions overlap  
but what you need to do is we we can already build into this g. d. f. format these regions if you can give a definition of what you think that is  
uh yeah  
ooh that you couldn't it'd be harder to break harder to lose  
i don't have examples here but um there is not a strict uh transition  
yeah  
yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership teamwork  
it's called a <unk>  
no you got a plastic  
i think it means like you know  
uh this is a <unk> yeah  
yeah  
um  
yeah maybe it's it's better if i write it myself because otherwise it's too easy to just split things up into bins  
yeah well let that let's make that a one  
no they're there  
so it appeared at least to well to our group  
is it uh <unk> is it here where um words importance file  
yeah so you have i. m. two in common  
yeah  
anyway  
you keep <unk> okay you can just write it on the paper  
mm-hmm  
but i mean this is once again a very constrained task again  
without a phase  
it's too slow  
uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere  
cool  
and that would fit in with what we want wouldn't it for the spongy feel to have everything rubber  
yeah that's not help either  
final design  
um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project  
okay  
okay  
no it isn't  
at the moment i don't even generate any document uh document for those  
oh  
uh-huh  
okay  
let's delegate  
trend  
okay  
since we have some kind of uh energy this is our  
and there is like a good justifiable reason um why we should do in a certain way and how we can then with a simple parameter adjust how much one weighs and how much the other weighs  
yeah  
if i just take well <unk> a file or where one meeting is in or  
for young people i think it's easy to use  
but the <unk> the <unk> <unk> could've actually been this kind of continuing um  
<unk> no wood  
you know at the materials that were presented in that <unk> without necessarily listening to the whole <unk>  
yep  
okay  
uh-huh  
which part is the most expensive part  
uh then would it be uh one o'clock  
okay logo we've got it in there haven't we  
may maybe here  
no  
it'll be in a different window yep  
now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented  
well mm did it come into the into i dunno if we counted that in the costs  
alright  
it's it's a lot more difficult than you would think  
that is one  
alright so  
yeah for <unk> maybe like uh like a pear or something  
okay so it's the size of the remote control  
how do you feel about that  
but in terms of that task is maybe twenty percent  
yeah i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh  
like it like we don't care we don't care that you had to  
mm-hmm  
okay so but the point would be that if we uh  
yeah  
you <unk> can't find out what they're doing otherwise  
yeah right  
oh  
so if we gave them say till mid march that would be good  
th th the uh base in a in another  
we think  
but  
yeah the zoom buttons  
oh  
it's it's just uh sort of it's you know communications <unk> sort of no  
but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work  
yes  
mm  
i would probably somehow have to break it down to to that level yeah  
i mean it's maybe not  
baroque <unk> and which  
mm-hmm  
yeah one scroll wheel you might need  
galaxy when it's a process  
uh what're they called  
has <unk> oh  
mm-hmm  
the other buttons and on here the top  
seven eight <unk> eight euros  
it's really not easy to use  
which  
we have to ask  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so the concern here is about the very local low level utterance to utterance relations in multi party meetings  
what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing  
no  
yeah well well i mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction encouragement  
yeah  
hand  
okay  
right  
we had um nice design and then you get the cost and you had to dump all your creativity  
mm-hmm  
uh yes there could be but we couldn't find out any so  
okay  
oh yeah that that i think i thought that was a quite good  
good  
so um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here and the red area is like a rubber covering  
mm-hmm  
well <unk> what what do you think about it  
mm-hmm  
i had speech recognition requires advanced <unk> require  
electronics  
it's hard to tell from here what they actually do and they don't look very exciting at all  
uh we don't have anything else  
no uh no that would be a curve inside the thing i guess  
with that concept i started thinking  
no i actually don't have like a <unk> thing 'cause i think it would be redundant  
and if anyone could clarify what that means  
yeah  
i'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder  
how would we do that  
<unk> and the percentage of time those <unk> cover you might want  
fast yeah  
yeah it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes uh you will have a uh prototype ready  
just all kind of colour  
certainly yeah  
okay because what we want here let's just mark what we want and mark that but with also broad line  
but not the kinetic  
it's a it's going to be titanium  
maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote  
mm-hmm  
go to video that's always on your remote control  
so something with give to it  
mm-hmm  
that really could get up and walk away  
it wasn't until we had this here you know  
like how much  
maybe it could be instead of like a standard rectangular shape it could be um something more interesting like  
you want me to draw in three d.  
yeah  
hmm  
you need to mention that any technology you intend to use so that at least if we have all the information yeah  
yeah right  
um <unk> it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design  
okay  
maybe we can keep the banana  
just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes  
no <unk> i i already did it  
yeah  
let's see i'll just make  
but basically these are curved and double curved i i believe that the tech department  
in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves the designers of this uh  
a blue a blue l. e. d. and we sell that um  
yeah  
yeah  
but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology that  
has to change channels has to change volume but in like specifics right which one of the basics are you trying to target  
so those i think are all my oh  
oh okay  
yeah  
yeah  
i think it's  
what is it  
and well the info on the website which came too late  
um i was thinking  
another one here  
the materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay  
ah  
and i'll see you in half an hour okay  
a bit <unk> you know  
um so if i manage to do some um uh practically usable software i'll tell you  
ah it's not scared  
yeah yeah  
first uh user interface  
yeah  
yeah  
um uh a video slave machine  
yeah you have a like that and so on  
mm-hmm  
exactly  
what do you choose  
yeah  
we are still working on titanium  
of the value yeah mm-hmm  
but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design  
i mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy you know  
so comparing them is is is is good setup with respect to the goal  
the closer it'll be to the overall structure of the net <unk> the internet which is a small world network  
then decide what kind of button layout we want how many buttons  
so but you how many bands you're using  
yeah  
right  
they the theory doesn't have them  
but  
yeah but you have uh uh an yeah but you have an international market range so you have i think a big range of  
ah we came up together we're good  
you know there was the yeah the collisions  
yeah  
there's a there's okay from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity  
mm-hmm  
what's difficult we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now  
for instance um let's say oh oh um  
hmm  
we'll do a little tool training with these two things  
but open  
yeah  
yeah and i will be away  
i don't think so  
which one  
um  
because if somebody is <unk> no simon king is he's one of the others but rob clark is the man that you met um  
and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have  
their own  
how could you possibly do that  
perhaps if there is a laptop and uh in one position  
uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids  
okay so we'll go two  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
just say maybe i just want to press i wanna have a button for all the movies tonight  
but if you want to look at the screen no  
mm-hmm  
we're <unk> mainly focusing on this group but i want to make the distinction clear  
yeah  
yeah i can just explain my project  
if i th if you think of it in terms of a <unk> tree  
so  
i liked the i liked the <unk> ooh come back  
oh yeah  
yes yes  
<unk> so that  
so annoying  
uh i think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in <unk> we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but  
yeah  
so so ho however many part however many mo however many parts there are in the file that's how many parts appear in the in the parts box  
alright  
mm-hmm  
so i will start by the the basic one that uh  
i think uh i think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right  
yeah mm-hmm  
it can be anything but it's just a way of saying yeah those <unk> documents are similar in some sense  
so that's alright  
options  
and what did you change  
so maybe it's not enough to justify uh an effort to improve the recognition  
uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe  
here is um a list of the uh um most important or yeah most probable words that occur in agreement  
yeah  
uh no no no you see uh i thought you can put in here your email address and and just uh do this and then it mails me  
well uh the place to put their files you know a smaller drawer  
'cause we on the display we probably take quite high  
and the third one is easy to use  
sliding window  
hmm  
and then uh yeah  
we <unk>  
so what else  
uh i think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic  
yeah  
yeah  
or is it gonna be on the basis of the title do they want more time to write the abstract  
okay so  
i wonder if we should um do something like dropping the bottom third  
i don't think so  
if we're getting into universal remote territory we're getting to l. c. d. screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot  
well  
artistic skills nil  
but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here  
yeah i think jen wants it to vibrate  
okay  
okay  
it's more cost more costly  
so after this if uh if uh uh we might do some mm <unk> uh from here we might be some uh uh  
mm-hmm  
but then  
yeah these are different age group persons like uh sorry i can open it in another way  
thanks  
you have plenty of time tim and uh janus don't uh talk to ten minutes so uh take your time  
not so much that we weren't full of ideas but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing  
i used it uh just to check it out but uh  
yeah  
okay  
it is very very fancy  
but then the side view can be straight  
mm-hmm  
i'm convinced uh sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us  
yeah uh  
oh no pressing  
oh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
but like you know generally about standard deviation  
i there's a few references missing  
a pointer  
channel  
which was the <unk> and the pens  
mm-hmm  
well leadership's a bit of a funny one isn't it  
i think that's a if the documentation said it <unk> could record in stereo then i think we should talk to them about how they've done this  
okay so not too much teletext support but in a separate menu and  
so generally dictionaries can grow bigger then you think they do  
well  
and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r. s. i.  
yeah but  
<unk> with the l. c. d. which costs two dollar you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two  
yeah  
sounds interesting  
slogan  
okay  
okay  
so without l. c. d.  
yeah  
like fifty percent or something with a good algorithm  
it's just really close to <unk> we <unk> we might see if we do it do it properly right  
that's true  
i don't think i hope nobody will eat it  
okay we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design  
so you can now tell how close two topic distributions are right  
mm  
i don't believe so  
you <unk> push here the the yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
right  
l. d. a. yeah l. d. a.  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
feel good meaning what  
yeah well um only as of friday actually  
no i th believe there's first lunch break  
true  
when you decide it's all over does it ping you back and  
not <unk> not sound i guess  
i would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things and the technical possibilities and <unk>  
hi  
like what's what's that i don't even know the name of it some kind of  
maybe it's easy  
right  
okay well  
wouldn't wanna be project manager  
from one point six or from european  
it's difficult  
<unk>  
yeah  
we can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think to to make a cover  
yeah that <unk>  
is is a  
mm-hmm  
no  
um  
wow  
but i it it is quite fundamental and uh causes quite immediate problems if you don't know about it  
i have always thought it's like more that oh whatever i'm a can't think of it at the moment  
yeah having a rechargeable stand so that not only it doubles as a stand  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
is there a new thing  
mm  
that's a short <unk> uh how it works  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i i knew you can get watches that had them like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery 'cause you're always moving your wrist  
so we would we would have the l. c. d. screen  
i think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it  
not just one single colour but a wood like thing can't you  
the r. r.  
well i don't know  
yeah  
so it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right  
yeah  
but when do you expect to have the system ready to work uh working  
or is anybody still alright  
that's right  
mm-hmm  
there we go  
yeah yeah  
advanced chip is three  
so there's nothing there worth transcribing  
you mean from was that joe  
but um you know i <unk> i do wonder how well that would work given that a t. v. you know  
sixteen yeah  
different designs  
is that i think um what we should think about is how the um  
and so i will show you some of the results from that which i think will be helpful  
is fairly institutional but um the main thing is i think  
nah no no no  
yeah  
<unk>  
but you don't have  
i think we have to investigate more on that but  
and we are trying to approximate that envelope which is  
so basically can i what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top  
uh with uh speakers  
you can ask your personal  
uh the speaker sensor we already have but <unk> i don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor  
ah  
okay  
um you're dismissed  
i i i think we should give up with teletext no  
yeah that's true  
so we're gonna each of you gonna give us a <unk> a little presentation  
right  
hmm  
you have to uh work on the technical functions and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs alright  
okay  
is there anything they're waiting on from us that is a problem or i they reasonably happy at the moment  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh it's batteries we're waiting for  
and that's as much as we really need  
you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know within hearing range  
but they're not you and i really  
i don't think it is  
yeah  
'kay  
the big and strong player in the market  
mm  
yeah exactly  
mm 'kay  
okay  
um a large on off button demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people so a large on off button would probably be good  
um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons  
phone them first to make sure that they're in there  
we'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff  
i think we are gonna have to narrow it down to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know  
no it's not an <unk>  
yeah  
that's <unk> is uh especially for older people that they can read it read it in their own language  
<unk> what <unk> what advantage would you get for the  
are we talking about the device itself or the <unk> or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable <unk> cover as a separate  
mm yes  
like these guys what they're doing for distributor speech recognition mainly this uh so  
when when you put uh maybe a colour l. c. d. <unk> uh screen on it it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from  
yeah  
okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises i think  
so well  
i will rule the world with it  
when the switch is pressed in a <unk> on this this case it switches a button  
so  
mm-hmm  
my um grammy does computer science back in the states and so they had um an e. d. u. and gov network  
so so that they could play with it while <unk> uh while handling it  
crazy dis designer okay  
that's we want to follow general trend  
mm-hmm  
i think we are well suited to our roles  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
um one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a <unk> on the infrared part of the spectrum  
that's just off the top of my head it is pending further emails  
um  
i don't i don't see it  
well i think that touch screens are generally square  
but um they vary quite widely even for the same speaker across meetings  
soft excess  
yeah in in a sense i mean this is a bit like the what like document frequency over total frequency  
clear the the the paint on it  
but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy  
mm-hmm  
i hope he's not involved with this  
okay at anyways the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly so there we go uh  
not so difficult  
um and what about the similarity measure for segments  
yeah  
uh no  
yeah so we have everything  
uh-huh  
the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed  
so  
yeah but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice  
when we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside what then it would be a simple chip  
mm-hmm  
hyperlink  
exactly  
i'm sure most of it i already know  
just if  
you know  
yeah yeah  
mm  
yeah that one  
um  
so does i  
there we go  
right  
so  
but why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature i i don't know  
no i think i think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v. c. r. or something if i've understood you correctly rather than menu as what's on  
<unk> i i think so  
yeah we just make it flat  
is it light or  
okay  
'cause an an alternative view would be that you could sort of make it that it always is the same length  
fifty  
dunno  
i see so it's more just basic  
the only thing is that i have to do is that they have uh data in uh one particular structure  
yeah of course  
the <unk> slide thing said would be good for r. s. i. so maybe it is but  
what's good with the directory is that you have a good coverage of various topic humans humans can label  
yeah  
after the no the the c. and the hyphen shouldn't there be a space  
ready to be used  
mm-hmm  
and then go back and do those searches one by one for each channel  
fruity  
um i wouldn't i no i can probably at least email her and ask her uh if she's really needing it all that time  
yeah  
or if you prefer working from mine and doing other changes  
hmm  
and what happens if suddenly you're unavailable all of next week just when he runs out of work  
you know right now if you take it you have like zero one two  
hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it you know  
yeah  
yep  
okay  
if you do need buttons you can flip it over and there's some there um but mainly it's speech recognition  
uh  
uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key  
just go on  
yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and  
hmm  
right  
uh i thought it was a catalogue  
or any suggestions  
i think that would be  
okay well  
yeah sure  
you can stick 'em in a different um track and uh and then load 'em or not load 'em as you please  
and where will be they  
so that means we're not doing the advanced  
yeah yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah okay yeah  
and then we're gonna close up the meeting  
um how fast you speak that's quite personal also  
i've got no idea how to draw a cow  
you probably have just to extend that class and then you can work with that value  
and i think that <unk> um is also does you know hinder us and things i think  
we put the fashion in electronics  
yeah  
just in my notebook but if anyone has any specific questions don't hesitate to email me or something  
they need that it doesn't create that much yeah  
or  
the the idea of using speech to reduce the button but uh and it's more natural  
sure sure  
but each one's got its own little  
mm-hmm  
so if they're not on the web we can try to look at that  
and what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker  
and uh yeah  
some of tho  
mm  
make it a bigger dial  
not anymore  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yep  
yeah okay so so th this is in as well then the sample speaker  
'cause that really makes a big difference  
yeah is it possible to store this on the share documents or what  
i uh couldn't uh okay uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey  
um  
um and the <unk> the <unk> uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a <unk> you uh you just get your uh things  
<unk> so this is the uh uh so direction of the information flow and also so speaker role might be first uh parameters for the uh ex uh information exchanges  
mm  
the other one  
fashion technology or something  
yeah  
just this as examples  
they the data how much data you need was not a problem with the switchboard 'cause he had lots  
ah  
yeah  
take away a heck of a lot of the there you go  
the the one who says it first gets a raise  
so and i th my my hypothesis was that if it's really yeah uh like agreement  
mm  
hmm  
i guess it's maybe because i'm not <unk> uh pen selected  
isn't gonna be a shouldn't be a big problem  
yeah so i've a accustomed to the environment here and enjoy staying here  
where am i looking  
um let's see  
finally we'll just close  
otherwise it's it's all fine  
um what about  
remote controls can be uh uh very user unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works  
it yeah <unk>  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah  
still the distribution of galaxies  
what do you mean there  
mm  
right  
yes you do mean ion lines  
yeah  
okay  
maybe you are broken  
um  
ha even more  
so  
the purple thing is the mailboxes  
they could but uh  
it's okay  
mm  
okay  
even still there's gonna be <unk> th there's there still will be interference from the t. v.  
i mean  
oh  
click again it's okay  
forty minutes  
the the industrial designer will <unk> or the working design of course we will uh  
is it not also it's expensive  
and <unk> with different colours with uh with different colours on on table you could uh display this this uh give some feedback  
so maybe i think  
if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes little little holes  
but let's let's <unk> start with beginning  
then we just subtract the number of second and third year students and then everything else is just i'd i would <unk> doing it just on a first come first serve basis  
um okay <unk> we're all clear where we go from here  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
right  
okay our secondary audience uh people above forty a forty years in age they like the dark traditional colours  
yeah what can i possibly enlighten on  
my couch is in that colour  
and uh also as uh i understood and uh i think it was a part of uh bob  
alright  
for the functional requirements and especially for the  
in a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel  
mm uh is is is their choice but uh um we we need to talk that through  
actually i want th one thing i would say i mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um <unk> product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over budget  
we in when you specify these things do you specify the molds or does it figure out what the molds are based on  
that's a technical term  
yeah  
yeah  
we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds  
okay well that that's definitely true  
uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips i i showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one right  
that's quite small yeah that's some utterances  
damped lyman alpha absorption the same  
they represent the number frequencies where a given person is dominant  
well i put some questions in a word file  
oh is that what yeah she's got a mm yahoo account or something that things are getting forwarded to and  
but how gonna okay just uh but it's uh monochrome it's <unk> it's not like  
yeah  
oh okay that's fair enough  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
i think i think i think i think <unk> or <unk> or however you pronounce that  
we didn't we didn't use the <unk> that much  
oh shoot  
we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume  
yeah  
okay that's good  
so it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching  
<unk> sounds  
yeah  
yeah  
and in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top  
so three lectures each that would be uh three per day times three will be twenty seven  
no  
not that they actually gave me any answers on the l. c. d. screens so i should have taken that bit out but anyway  
yeah yeah <unk> <unk> i think we've agree on that yeah  
with l. c. d.  
okay  
it's uh  
<unk> oh it's just putting the rest of it into words but it's essentially the same thing  
why  
yeah  
mm well uh i i think  
that would be good  
we'll still settle for twenty five  
oh there yes  
i just got mine i still haven't read the instruction book and i'm doing okay so and i'm not good at learning technology  
yeah <unk>  
use a random <unk>  
aye  
okay  
there you go  
i think it'd be hard to understand what was going on if you used like just the language without watching the video to decide whether we're breaking down the task  
mm  
and on the other tele televisions you can also use it but then we won't use the  
yeah  
yeah  
so we'll we will just hope that you catch it  
you might need uh  
it doesn't say in the manual about features or not but we <unk> when we saw ones previously we marked features  
rat  
i think about twenty minutes  
yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology huh  
whatever  
uh well i a a two  
mm okay  
pay those uh papers uh that are expensive i'm not going to uh  
because kids yeah  
<unk> or deciding which one to choose or thinking so you don't want to decide it's only one and throw the other one out  
well then we have two dollars less profit  
my name is  
i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them  
yeah  
thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish thanks  
i'm pretty sure i could nick a lift off someone  
right  
hmm  
it's uh  
maybe  
so now what you do is <unk> looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time  
mm  
or and then  
wow  
because they they share some common properties which are not seen as the same for every one  
okay i'm gonna we'll look at that in a second  
in my opinion  
yeah  
right  
uh-huh  
yeah what for me is it um i <unk> i don't know what i'm marketing right now  
so did they reduce it's in between the direct <unk> this is full <unk>  
that's not a terrible lot as far as i'm aware and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five  
but i dunno but why nobody's a threat to me  
<unk> <unk> like what are they called those face plate things  
we'll let you know when we're done if we can go earlier  
i don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is  
hmm  
maybe with the l. c. d. we can do something with less buttons but  
yeah this was  
there's different ways of a user can use products <unk> like a remote  
which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of d. c.  
but  
just uh only the channels and or  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
okay as for the colours we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype  
but it's it's backwards  
yeah yeah  
where was it  
hmm  
alright fine  
so he compute this error here  
do you want the gizmo  
yeah  
nice  
no it's too no  
we must use additional source of energy which i found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything  
they could come back  
we'll just fingers crossed and hope ho yeah ho hope that all this is just a software thing that we can just fix like that and that'll be it  
channel two  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
mm-hmm  
okay so  
right  
you mean by matching strings  
<unk>  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no so so the coconut project is a project that i did with rich <unk> and barbara <unk>  
yeah it doesn't  
um  
i guess  
yeah  
nice  
mm-hmm  
i think that is yeah  
yeah it's different  
we have <unk> scroll wheel interface integrated scroll wheel <unk> and an l. c. d. display  
but though smooth inside  
well that they are plastic because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable  
it it's fancy  
uh covered that  
well a few interface i uh i found on the internet are are these  
and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it  
you agree  
as long as it gets done  
mm-hmm  
okay  
oh okay  
and the button for the <unk> uh audio video uh external input  
um that kind of books  
i've heard of that  
kinetic  
right  
but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer you know  
yeah  
or too long  
no  
uh coordinating the meeting  
i wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first in like on the way to channel sixty five  
hmm  
yeah i i'll just say uh if you want i can point to um three papers  
yeah  
i think we can put a six here  
i was thinking about just uh the basic functions and i got uh  
the the simple functions for for the the whole public and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh  
which disk  
ha hang on let me catch up  
uh since we're having l. c. d. <unk> there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider  
alright  
but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments  
yeah okay  
you can try and set something on the clock and use try and catch and then if you catch the exceptions set the flag  
so we can say that this is sort of for but then again you get the more formal visitor in with a bunch of students in a crowded room  
um okay so i really like jeff buckley  
but would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did i know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question  
so if we're flat on the bottom it's not gonna roll away it'll stay where we want  
yeah  
my first idea is because  
also  
i think it would make it uh  
my my computer went blank now  
yeah probably as long as we need  
but that's that's vantage of l. c. d. screen you can have text  
yeah well that that's that's just x. m. l. to x. m. l. to x. m. l. isn't it  
i don't really know  
but you know what i figured out i'm quicker down loading over broad band into my computer than using this hard disk  
uh  
two yeah two  
huh  
where are they  
to set the par  
two  
yes  
sorry  
<unk>  
okay  
<unk> way too the the choice of components was way too narrow  
because i'm sure that they might be interested indeed because i imagine that some people  
um so we're gonna divide us up into three <unk> three parts  
so where do you where do you have them from at the moment the split up  
and not accidentally translating in the process  
so no flipping but just no  
yeah  
shall we wait 'til i've 'til i've showed you what well my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available  
mm-hmm  
um  
i think it's awesome  
yeah but  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
but there is means of doing tool tips that just i <unk> i put my mouse over  
we need to take care of that  
okay  
uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know a nice looking remote control  
yeah okay  
that was the end  
yeah i <unk> that's all he asked for  
scale likelihood  
and uh yeah it should be very zap friendly as most users use it for that  
i had um a look at the um for example a. s.  
irritating  
yeah you too  
okay  
um and you can see that number decreases a bit with <unk> <unk> interestingly enough twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount  
i mean that's  
he types everything  
um it will make an original design more obtainable as we have less functional necessities to include in the design  
mm  
we should be  
yes  
um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people  
yeah  
from our <unk> fashion people in paris and milan  
very good  
that's a <unk> as well  
yes  
sure  
people talk about them a lot but  
yeah  
and then you can run this set of experiments over <unk>  
yeah  
so i what i think is that we already will need to apply <unk> kind of analysis by synthesis approach mm uh in order to get something  
i think so too  
yeah still doesn't feel natural  
but  
chief i am the industrial designer  
i can go  
mm-hmm  
i don't know like there's such a problem with losing them  
hmm  
no because you choose by channel so you choose by t. v. program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from  
no then you press ninety nine  
yeah  
we love this thing  
okay  
okay  
and then the direct show  
technical function design and working design  
mm-hmm  
yes  
or or do you get a <unk>  
mm-hmm  
in this company  
so and this was what we came up with  
ah i see i asked support about that two days ago  
um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and i was kind of wondering about this example that they have  
like that  
on the most <unk>  
right  
yes  
mm-hmm  
<unk> five by ten  
right  
um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage  
mm  
i never understood how that worked though but yeah  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
and it would just be a list like this and you click on one and then <unk> you tho you know  
yeah  
there we go  
and uh unrealistic  
yeah  
and there were lots of lots and lots and lots of things as you can see  
so over over how many different over which length is this  
and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet  
'kay  
i have no idea  
mm-hmm  
and that's all  
<unk>  
uh <unk> i don't know why yeah yeah yeah  
try  
okay the the yellow banana like thing is i think is okay  
and you would want that all in one file for all the corpus  
this is uh the agenda for our first meeting  
because it that's just for one seasonal trend  
it's one of the marketing features in this  
yeah you wanna navigate the channels quickly i guess  
what's the what was the appropriate thing to do at this point  
i dunno maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or  
no  
it's um switching between channels sort of randomly going through  
but now for the kayak case i don't know  
you want me to draw something  
no problem mm  
like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it  
you want something that's easy to do now something that doesn't like <unk> uh well i i i don't know  
so the <unk>  
yeah that's the single curve indeed  
means even if the <unk> has been done they did the <unk> there and they they worked on that started working on that  
so this is what alan black's code uses  
uh i think most most things have already been said like uh control multiple devices  
but i mean this one is the i. v. c.  
yeah i don't know what they do  
okay to do this  
yeah yeah  
um  
um  
what  
sure  
i don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says just  
yeah  
ah  
uh um i was given a  
on off uh volume favourite channels uh and menu  
yeah  
keyword spotting yeah  
um but these are these are all necessary functions  
and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements  
okay  
i don't think so  
okay  
yeah my grandparents lived on um thirty second  
about that programme  
special colour  
no  
a clown  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
yeah lunch break  
<unk> where where shall we locate the buttons  
not so many  
yeah can you not just leaves those lines blank  
you see a lot of <unk> uh silver televisions  
the r. s. i. compares to the current standards well  
yeah  
it is a very good point  
but that  
mm-hmm  
you can look at it  
like we're kind of what we're <unk> sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they  
users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls  
yeah i sent you the slides you didn't see them  
mm  
uh hearing devices  
six point five  
okay now work a little with me  
i'm trying to get this right  
oh yeah <unk> put them in pockets  
um um among the findings i found that <unk> <unk> most of the <unk> mm presently available remote controls also include other mm <unk> um in their design  
it'd probably be yeah best to make a copy of it  
concepts  
now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here  
so you got mo yeah  
hmm  
i know  
exactly  
alright excellent  
mm 'kay  
here you go  
so  
uh and  
um like you can go over your ideas of course in your own personal times  
well  
so a separate button for for text okay  
well ease has certainly stayed  
yep  
i don't know if you can help me  
it's better than it was i guess  
uh um what else  
yeah but uh uh  
um not really it would make it hard to turn the machine off to turn your t. v. off  
i are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings  
oh okay  
okay so well <unk>  
okay  
yeah here on the left you have different things but uh as applied  
mm-hmm  
our <unk> i think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them  
'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the l. c. d. in but for the electronics as well  
yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter  
yeah  
yeah  
is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions  
mm-hmm  
go on go back and  
yeah we should <unk> yeah  
filler words or  
maybe ten channels yeah at the most  
be like  
the uh uh they were twenty twenty minute talks with ten minute uh question time okay  
we uh will associate uh a way of <unk> <unk> it  
oh yellow yellow ball  
do we want to go for buttons at all do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit  
the only break down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump  
sorry  
alright  
oh the  
hasn't it it's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect  
there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches <unk> sort of uh uh in the market  
so you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks  
oh okay  
<unk>  
um  
we're going the way we'll do that i think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that  
<unk> features within or referring to <unk> types of source when we're not bother marking the source  
ninety one  
materials would be <unk> at least the last meeting i would have expected had to have that  
mm-hmm  
um before we get to the good news  
and you can tele yeah once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext  
that's cool  
i mean 'cause it's an awful lot of speech activity which is yeah  
ah i have to uh consult my legal advisor about it  
i think  
yeah  
yeah  
i mean if that's too big it's a rubber remote so you can you know  
okay  
it's a it's a gimmick factor that they like at first and  
okay cool  
yeah we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours  
but it just like it's a little bit like writing thesis all the time re writing and change the do make a little changes and uh uh and  
yeah  
okay  
we can go with the script and sort of go for each segment to the starting and end times and say okay  
using get measure  
okay  
but we yeah even we should uh for instance for the videos uh for the <unk> clustering for the clustering  
i just i just would have the words and then how we um how long each expression would be i don't know  
so we got stuck at some point on evaluation of <unk> right  
yeah  
then don't just go into that um segment but load a new file or something like it but in general use the same algorithm  
well  
i'll have a bash at it  
'cause i know when i um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad  
so this is yeah  
well  
yeah yeah  
check that number also  
there's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll wheel  
true  
so  
so if we do every second uh i <unk> the middle frame is uh this one thousand  
so  
thanks for your attention  
you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this now it's embedded one  
it you can end up having to take three afternoons or three mornings or whatever off  
big bird  
kept in the shape we cannot <unk> uh so we need that the that the peeling  
yeah i i read something about it but it wasn't very clear  
yeah  
okay okay  
okay  
oh  
mm  
you have the buttons the the case uh itself and the rubber and th  
our team response to these questions  
yeah  
oh they can be small or round like buttons  
oops  
he'll be useful for the w. p. seven stuff  
okay  
and this is an angle in <unk>  
mm-hmm  
in thirteen point seven we do have kinetic  
hmm  
and then a a new blank document for  
two stationary windows  
yeah  
um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics  
and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other  
anyway  
oh yes it should be  
okay  
what have we done differently  
yeah but  
okay and and the look and feel is  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
smaller  
maybe two points  
should be this and it probably is that's probably what that means  
and the report  
but you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and <unk>  
um if you all go stand around uh  
it's gonna stick in your head  
and his software is precisely to do that to um cluster at uh another level  
well done everybody  
channel five channel seven you know how many you can't have that many words  
yeah i would agree with that i think  
oh  
it's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics  
um  
yeah  
yes  
it's it's a bit later in the in the report  
uh in fact the um slide card <unk> sorry  
no  
these are <unk> these are back ups  
it's doing some stuff now  
yeah  
yeah  
oh maybe th maybe this is an  
but it is soft  
three if we're being generous i feel  
as long as you make sure you start 'em before the flash then you're fine  
it's quite a standard one but it's not from a t. v. it's from a much  
uh no  
we can go ahead with what we have  
okay  
we only agreed that so far we've only agreed that we can't include <unk> features modifying nebula  
yep  
<unk> can do it  
so we can always do that  
ah he's new  
um  
um and uh marketing executive  
so what we're talking about is changing  
let's add one of those features and say yes  
yeah  
oh hat ha rat  
i've received uh a framework which we can do this  
i would give it more than a four  
um okay oh the um  
so  
so  
well i'm gonna erase my uh name  
exactly  
yeah  
and as long as your algorithm respects that then we can just  
so you can use your gesture  
the the <unk> the next minutes won't be a problem  
power source rather  
yeah per unit  
this is a red switch off that's how it should be  
what do you say seven  
it's more or less but not exactly like uh it's two times or one point five times or something  
yeah  
fine  
this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation  
i i as i mentioned before we have a bus manager and the bus manager send just a flag to say now it's time to give me you data  
okay  
hang on  
mm  
it was sometime in the last two weeks anyway  
uh yeah no no  
right  
the clapper  
yeah yeah okay yeah  
okay  
line ratio  
ah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
alright  
it's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though to be fair  
yeah  
i don't know what what i mean  
um titanium is not gonna be possible even though it just it beyond our budget really  
it wouldn't make any sense but it'd give you an idea of what they're actually talking about if you see what i mean  
uh sorry clothes shoes and furniture  
yeah  
yeah i'm not so good at drawing with this kind of <unk> oh shit  
mm-hmm  
i mean would we have poster boards or is it just gonna be posters on the walls  
um and depending on how many members you have in households  
there is uh something i don't know if you know i know it uh calls sphinx that is doing uh <unk> sorry  
ooh  
um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys  
<unk> low isn't it the ink  
right  
when you set it up it should be set to go  
<unk>  
twenty four  
if something happened with the machine and uh i don't <unk> the <unk> system it doesn't matter right  
yeah  
i think so too but and that's partly because um uh a lot of t. v. <unk> have different menus  
but we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part  
maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um things like channel and volume um are used all the time  
there isn't  
is it innovative  
um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in including the production evaluation  
the thing is we can't afford to bias it towards any particular kind of linguistics in a sense  
okay  
um plastic for some reason incurs no cost which i've had to very much make advantage of  
otherwise if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first  
what's the time  
the all these experiments probably  
course maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option  
yeah  
yeah we we'll make <unk> this one trendy  
it's not about the content it's about okay um is it easy to <unk>  
yeah  
that i didn't mark because it's the physical process of absorption  
okay i'll wrap it up quickly  
yeah  
<unk> i i think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t. v. to to to print these things  
yeah  
okay  
real reaction in a real  
'kay  
so it's a so it's a lit so it's quieter because it's not as though it's not powered  
great thank you  
everybody has a white remote control with black buttons and a red button and a green button not everybody wants that  
do you do you see a bit of the of the um  
it it mean yeah well okay  
so um uh that's one thing  
yeah which might  
we <unk> were weren't sure about putting them there because um i it's it kind of could get bashed  
mm  
uh  
i know but well  
i'm doing nationalism studies  
geez and <unk> and show  
yeah right  
uh i want to have the deadline at end of december to finish all my project  
yeah but it's not a positive thing  
well personally i do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow  
for diversity or something  
project  
um  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah sea view yes simpson's versions and  
yeah  
and um you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh the the new you add more topics and it doesn't get better in any way the model doesn't  
mm mm  
yeah you might end up having to take off the  
and then uh we can we can uh use the time better  
this is nice  
but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need um  
in this way i think it's fair if you <unk> if you know only if you know only that and that and what you would like to discover is this  
well we don't want uh older people we want young people  
so main actions i guess might be some some high level uh problem solving or decision making uh uh concepts  
i don't i don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one  
good morning  
sorry  
ah yeah  
yeah i think that like the <unk> the drawing has to be changed anyway the it's not ideal at the moment  
thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this  
mm-hmm  
but all this is quite you know data intensive  
but still it's good like now  
and we could probably get quite a few in there at least six anyway  
oh sorry i'm taking over your job here  
real reaction remote control  
but a  
so which  
so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance  
so that you know if it's actually pressed or not  
but would've been maybe for future projects  
okay  
yeah  
for how do you draw that again  
and there are buttons uh behind it which you can use if you <unk> if you don't if you don't have a  
um display the menu on the t. v. and don't um use combination of <unk> of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds  
um but that's me  
basically  
oh okay right  
stylish yeah  
well  
or yellow and blue  
can we just fill a second class with junk that we don't care about  
so that you can do on a dice machine independent of <unk>  
um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible  
yeah  
so it's two two and three  
mm-hmm  
yes it's not a <unk> feature  
excellent  
sure  
yeah  
for electronics we have these very technical um descriptions here  
now just make sure they don't eat the remote  
well we're not sadly going to actually be producing this so  
think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r. r. teams  
yeah  
we'll do that when <unk> when you get your design  
everybody always says there's no data like more data  
so this is really some somehow i mean the uh the the issue i mean i'm sure that there are plenty of possibilities to do things  
so few buttons channel  
yes yes  
i think maybe that would make sense for you guys to know  
mm-hmm  
the functions design what effects the apparatus should have and the working design how the apparatus actually works to <unk> its function  
and then you wouldn't have blinks as part of this  
if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen  
yeah indeed  
um or you could have um l. c. d. which gives you a display  
yeah from the account manager  
true and i <unk> i think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people  
um what a what alternatives do we have to that  
or not luckily  
you can only save it in my documents  
so um  
must be a dog  
or or inside  
what time is it <unk>  
thirty minutes  
i think line peak is something you can point to  
where were we  
yes  
but  
that's part of a name yeah  
um well we kinda paid for the lab  
and you can put that on and off and switch it  
uh the innovation is <unk> is very high i think  
oh  
oh yeah <unk> you're right  
directly  
yes  
in here  
solar i don't think would be such a good idea because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light  
it's all automatic  
just because i <unk> for example if i'm using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down so i thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing  
okay so th that's that's basically now now uh i think that uh we can integrate um uh you know  
and the sound is going to start at the same time as one of that arbitrary one of the <unk> videos  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
by pressing the menu button again you go uh out  
not not anything any research  
oh <unk> yeah  
that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like  
in fact  
great  
animation  
yeah  
okay  
<unk> that's that's a fiddling play in the end but that problem we'll always have  
well the thing is if it was had an alarm system i mean  
okay so in terms of not losing it do you think that on a scale of one to seven how easy or hard is it to lose  
i mean even that minor thing  
mm  
yeah  
function  
no no  
it will it will break other stuff <unk> when it's plastic as well  
continuum flux we should have all in  
it's a very uh yeah very uh ambitious uh company  
yeah i it's the same thing like it it does tell you whether this uh which clustering is better for this task  
maybe we should have also a digit button  
<unk> <unk> is important  
i have the numbers <unk> i have the numbers right here  
right so okay success on the <unk>  
yeah  
each one of us has an idea and then it's not true at all  
yeah this is this is your thing  
evaluation criteria  
then  
the microsoft version of s. v. g. or something  
unless you could say the channel  
mm  
right i'm gonna have to i'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time  
but and i've highlighted it separately  
yeah  
just 'cause that's <unk> how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time  
mm 'kay thank you  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
and uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like <unk> mm for instance my <unk> maker that i got from my bank  
so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something  
to have some feedback  
and we're hoping for a aim of fifty million euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market  
separation uh  
twenty eight  
the  
you can do i is there some kind of nice <unk> der quality plastic that we can work with  
when they should be  
and then at the back  
so first you apply these triangle filters and then do l. p. c. coding or like  
it should be okay  
uh  
spongy  
as soon as somebody gives me the raw text of the whole thing  
yeah yeah  
on the number of buttons kind of functions and stuff  
and you can record your own <unk> verbal labels that are connected to remote control functions  
yeah i think that will be  
okay this is uh something about the project finance  
and i'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off  
so four six six  
mm-hmm  
it's hard to miss it  
our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait no this is not the one  
uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option  
yeah  
the you have all buttons on it which you'd like microphone extra l. c. d. screen extra scroll  
so is it is it possible to do that  
yeah  
um  
when we see the results there is no doubt there maybe a lack of leadership  
i uh yeah yeah  
um  
okay uh i'm uh i'm the industrial designer and i uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project  
hello  
and uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls  
don't really know how to draw this  
<unk> mm-hmm  
yes  
each other's  
okay  
i think overall 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion so those are the next two things we're gonna look at  
okay well that's not that much to work with  
<unk> well yeah  
yep okay we can have soft excess  
um unless we come up with some new age product a as far as the casing is concerned  
my documents  
um  
but that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design with the <unk> text and that kind of thing  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
uh but children uh if children don't don't know the pin code they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or  
mm  
or advanced  
so i think we've done very well but  
line centre  
and also possible i mean uh we could gain out of that by advertising certain t. v. shows or  
but i guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much  
yeah  
i think it's good  
there's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something  
because i think they're more likely to think it was relevant to them  
yeah that's <unk> how i tend to do it  
it's more like you know give me the <unk> and the um the blinks  
okay  
so the question is what we ca we make it for  
bug  
mm-hmm  
afro beat orchestra  
i think so we need if we try to have a kind of  
yeah if you have some financial information that that'd be nice so  
you know <unk> um what scope one annotation would have  
right okay  
well i have  
schematic view of the remote control but nothing about uh advanced chips or  
so if there's a <unk> a way of finding it quite easily i thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature  
um  
well we we will come to that but <unk> first on the on the functions  
i could do both  
okay so  
okay  
oh no that i think it's good thing to be different than  
and um <unk> is important and and uh soft materials  
yeah okay  
and as for  
okay  
i think  
i don't know if that meant that you could see it or not  
ooh closing the meeting  
um uh <unk> so does that accurately <unk> what we've discussed  
well you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic  
yeah  
or do you have to go through and you wait for it  
yeah yeah  
but all this stuff that goes with annotation that we have it in the right format  
um and we're thinking to carry on with the fruit and vegetable theme  
mm-hmm  
yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and  
but  
<unk> you should make uh a sideways uh view  
yeah  
not bad  
yeah i i would say definitely  
it's  
so it could be sufficient to uh yeah define enough sectors and  
<unk> the role of secretary take the meeting minutes  
interchangeable yeah  
uh yeah i think so  
what's that one there  
um <unk> sorry <unk>  
yeah  
but um  
it's basically what we agreed upon but just a little bit more specified  
yeah  
yeah  
you simply <unk> slide a bar to say what time it begins and slide another bar to say what time it ends you know that's  
it might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things  
uh the overall um <unk> uh speech recognition using the slides uh seems to be uh uh not very uh um good  
yeah i think they're on the n. l. s. s. d. web page  
make 'em more appealing as well  
so so hoffmann in his paper was doing just <unk> similarity but you can do anything  
still in progress  
yeah i'm just trying to move it  
well we can start off  
it's also different  
and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose  
yeah  
and they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two euros  
great  
so we can tell you a little bit more about it  
<unk> no it's a slightly curved around the sides  
yeah  
that's what i think  
mm-hmm  
and one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic  
yeah yeah <unk> the fruit  
i win  
i think they're worth ten percent  
you don't change that often yeah  
the mute could possibly be a bit smaller  
yeah  
um so i was looking at basic design things does it <unk> its functions as a remote  
alright it is <unk> time  
mm  
oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs  
oh i've got line that's fine  
yeah and something else  
okay  
yeah  
<unk>  
are we considering these points here  
you really have to imagine like winding up your uh i <unk>  
because if i change my configuration and your results are somewhere else  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
that's it  
yeah  
so you so you move to the next the next one  
oh  
mm  
if it should be done if it could be done i won't matter  
right now it probably won't be much benefit  
uh yes  
so  
yep sure  
yes  
'cause ours is strict  
nah it it's it's better than average but  
alright  
no  
i it's th brilliant  
uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it  
uh when you tick in a number it will uh start and end uh recording  
right  
you may have to do the function f. eight thing  
mm uh  
that's true  
so what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project  
i'm sure it's fine  
sure you can you know  
yeah okay  
true  
no  
there's one way to uh  
there is no <unk>  
well  
mm  
yellow  
you don't think that it  
so it it's <unk> uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of <unk> point of view  
okay  
function wise what does that do that  
there are different cases that can be provided  
more  
well this is my question for him  
so we have to <unk> we have all the parts the interesting parts of the screen identified and be able to show distribution of gaze over time  
yeah after  
yeah  
i didn't experiment with this  
uh i it  
i mean  
like a what  
if they're corresponding <unk> for each thing yeah they should be right  
is this a good looking remote  
um  
there's <unk> not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh i think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote  
yeah yeah yeah  
have you currently got continuous i. d. <unk> for your topic segments  
i found some stuff about it on the web and it just looked to me like proper coding  
virtual machine should be fine  
what else have we got  
in any colour  
so this actually means we have the week directly after easter between my coming back and you leaving  
no they were fine with it so  
um perhaps it's useful perhaps for because people um lose the remote they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something  
do your thing tim  
um i had a talk to the design people about this but having a remote that's tactile that feels different that would be really cool  
p. l. p. is hardly anything yeah  
so um but no that's that's fine  
mm i think it's good okay  
yeah that's a good idea  
<unk>  
mm  
hmm  
yeah yeah yeah  
no but uh the <unk> the buttons have to uh have to have uh international <unk> buttons and uh  
um i think the thing was that if you decide to do this to have triangular buttons  
okay finance  
interface concepts no  
i think it's cheaper than laser so  
other than what it looks like i dunno if it's really  
okay  
yeah  
i thought i read a  
okay  
it's it's quite easy  
okay  
anyway who is the author of festival  
then celebration  
although herve just said that we shouldn't <unk> talk about confidential things here  
th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera  
we need power and volume  
another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated because more people are using the internet now  
the um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only  
okay but we can work that out later i guess  
yeah  
so i think maybe we just need to put under don't include diffuse emission  
but you know <unk> be firmly on  
okay  
the laptop  
<unk> and you have a look at it will it make sense for what you want  
notice the giant dog bone shape  
yeah but <unk> he doesn't  
well it may not for the whole meeting but like  
that's right  
but if you're not entirely sure that it could be 'cause it <unk> it could be a combination of something else  
no li yeah  
we are probably the best  
i mean to  
something that <unk> the <unk>  
so  
so they want the the the normal functions like teletext volume changing  
interface  
yeah oh we hold the remote  
right  
device fancy feeling  
and fruit and vegetables yeah  
oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep  
alright  
as for the design maybe we <unk> should hire a designer to help  
and if it ever ever gets to be a problem in the pilot i can easily reduce the size of whatever  
and it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls  
or  
exactly  
we can't have solar panels with rubber so  
'cause that's when we're thinking sometimes like why is mm high  
okay  
yeah  
so one  
okay  
mm-hmm  
and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time  
oh  
and i would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice  
i think over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration  
<unk> yeah  
um and most users are very <unk> use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller  
animals in our world  
okay technical sense  
yeah  
well maybe we could add something but maybe if what do you th we're trying to save money so  
<unk> i'm not mentioning uh voiceless because that's <unk> which means whispered  
like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever  
like that  
um so i mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface  
so then we should implement such a but  
okay  
mm-hmm  
and  
vomit  
um maybe our  
we've got push buttons as well  
yeah  
you know if you got something you think about language come to  
oh  
the show must go on  
okay  
interesting  
no  
so you know he might get triangle one there and no maybe this one's gonna overlook lap quite a bit  
yeah i didn't receive any info uh  
um so there's things like that  
yeah  
yeah it <unk> it would look good  
right  
<unk> i think there was plenty of room  
still that  
yeah it'd look pretty and i'm not convinced you'd get any kind of good quality summary out of it in only five lines  
no it's no  
at the same time yo see if you crash a machine i mean because you are doing some test  
so i go for two  
um i reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway  
mm-hmm  
when do we have to meet again then with this  
no it's weird  
the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time so we'll go through each of you one by one  
so that literally anybody can come along pick up the remote and still know what do do  
mm  
yes  
i pressed the mouse button  
so  
mm that you stick on t. v.  
twelve i believe  
yeah  
yeah because it's really big city no  
that was correct wasn't it  
so we've got our sort of keyboard kind  
maybe afterwards we could do a uh <unk> with that your the one on the right as a as a  
i mean you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically but  
yeah  
sometimes people uh <unk> improve is more uh so for example that what that's another thing that fits in that kind of uh mm framework  
my remote control is pink  
yeah  
uh  
it's okay  
so that that everything went down like on the tuesday morning  
um i'm gonna do like an on line museum archive  
this is  
um  
uh-huh  
yeah it's pretty exciting  
mm 'kay  
oh  
alright  
um professors on staff so they got the the individual offices  
sorry about the uh lack of information on cost i just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and i'm just having to guess  
yeah  
perfect  
i don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any t. v. can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen yeah  
they're the main the main features of the ipod the things you will use a all the time  
'kay  
hmm  
the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought  
yes the voice recognition we already decided  
emission line a. g. n.  
well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition  
yeah special material <unk> also because i has rubber  
but i think that might be something to do with the original configuration than the parts that weren't the same across the two  
yeah  
<unk> that blue bits should be yellow <unk> that that'd be where the batteries would be i suppose  
i don't remember what we were doing with <unk>  
well you  
single curves  
yeah yeah yeah  
such like this there are several uh examples in the slides  
yes  
so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not  
yeah i do i don't know that  
yeah okay  
uh how yeah  
you can just yeah but it's it isn't a picture or well is it  
one  
so i um keep in touch with the r. and d. department  
but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control  
and uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off and uh switching channels and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that  
you know the the company it's it's from what i can see from our other products are yellow with blue writing on them  
very cool  
<unk> i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay  
making a search with that  
yeah  
than the screen  
definitely seven  
uh let me <unk>  
here  
no i don't think so  
would that handle it that this would only like the display would only display one group  
yeah  
yeah right  
um  
that's good  
but <unk> yeah but i guess it's not it's not defined by a <unk> feature though h. two region whereas  
and the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television  
okay great  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's true  
uh and third priority uh for ease of use so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be  
mm-hmm  
uh that's uh  
but  
yeah  
uh well it's it's simply filling oh no it's uh it's also filling out no i'd do it after lunch i think  
this is titanium  
mm-hmm  
you discussed either a lithium or a solar power  
mm-hmm  
aye right  
okay  
mm-hmm  
they're very big and not very much use for buttons  
how much should you want um i had a few times where i thought well it could be this  
no forget it  
so  
yeah conceptual design  
should should be  
no that's a <unk> and that's a digital pen  
yeah my topic <unk> doesn't like blank lines either  
sony uh t. r. something uh <unk> means nothing to me  
mm-hmm  
we have uh these two <unk>  
uh i sort of prepared this  
oh okay cool  
you know if you get a new t. v. set you tune in all the channels do you th do you think  
yeah i con exactly  
a duck  
yeah pretty much  
oh  
so i mean if you need me to work on something else um i can try to finish my stuff um early  
yeah i i know that i don't know how to use the cluster  
mm  
so it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape  
yeah  
a two  
we have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh industrial um designer  
no quite quite right  
hmm  
um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design  
yeah  
yeah maybe  
i mean is that something we really want to go into do you think or should we just consider running on regular batteries  
um we could maybe come up with a menu a sort of a an l. c. d. menu for other functions on the remote control  
so just walk through it step by step  
yeah  
but we can have both uh  
so it's coarse to fine design  
uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape  
i mean software wise there's really no difference  
yep yep  
so  
and uh um she's i know she already knows that it's just anyone doing psycho linguistics basically  
<unk>  
let you loose  
mm-hmm  
in fact they replaced all the lapel mic files on the m. m. m. server with head set mic files  
i was i was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case  
okay  
i think you just do one don't you for the  
do we need an l. c. d. display  
okay <unk> that's pro that's gonna get confusing like that  
oh boy  
uh it should be uh thirteenth december i think  
okay  
mm  
real reaction is uh yeah  
yeah  
i'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal  
so what you're really doing is sorting a list is the <unk> <unk> hard part of it  
well it's the most advanced  
well let's start it as it is  
no um solar cells yeah  
okay  
i would break it  
mm-hmm  
you doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting we'll be done  
um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive  
now  
um the other design stages uh we will discuss that later  
mean of uh seventy percent i think  
what's it what's the company called  
what's this anyway  
the finances  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
if of the document by word stuff it's very easy to then calculate for each word a score  
if we need to make some special thing on the browser it's <unk>  
but if we have the option of of <unk> at any particular speed or the option of jumping direct okay  
yeah  
yeah let's leave it in  
okay  
oxygen abundance  
yeah but <unk> but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go  
the block that that rectangle for the user interface is where the user comes in of what what does it look like  
i have the uh scripts but uh well it takes time it's c. p. u. and regenerating all these things but okay it's okay  
yeah  
thickness  
if you have pistol it l. c. d. <unk> not easy  
you don't feel too constrained  
is it it isn't just one discrete  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> yes  
so evaluation  
and  
so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price it's not possible to go <unk> to go to l. c. d.  
unit  
stay here and  
mm  
<unk> they'll be sexy with it  
so a device for  
they heal  
absolutely  
um  
<unk> you you may get the idea  
for muting the uh  
uh <unk> no  
right  
you can just  
yeah  
mm-hmm yeah  
the the big remote control something like that  
that's that's um a problem  
that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that the channel buttons they <unk> become the <unk> buttons  
it that's the thing i'm gonna keep thumping on  
'kay  
uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the <unk> lab using a remote control  
yeah  
well we we kind of have  
<unk> treated the same as as the mouse say  
yeah  
i mean i think it's very likely that um if people are considering <unk> mm-hmm  
<unk> one  
and you are trying to find to uh yeah to find the harmonics in a temporal domain right for that  
yeah  
uh  
and solar cells i dunno about that  
line emitting gas doesn't get in  
i think  
it's both a <unk> but this one is used for a desktop and that one is used to to draw  
yep  
awesome okay  
you  
okay  
did the following changes  
yeah  
okay  
use  
yeah uh yeah  
wow  
um and did you try to make a new design or what were you trying to do  
yeah  
the working method um there were hundred uh uh <unk> <unk> one hundred people uh  
that was that was a <unk> simple idea i had and then you know you could about  
yeah  
uh <unk> is here as the marketing expert <unk> is here as the user interface designer and sebastian is here uh in the role of industrial designer  
so <unk> uh <unk> the philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh <unk> to reach channel twelve  
five minutes to go  
yeah okay  
li li like a teenager for instance  
see if they like it  
maybe fingerprint recognition or  
it's about discussion we had earlier  
yep  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
and that's more or less all what we are doing  
nothing else to to add  
as long as the voice recognition stuff works that's that's fine  
hmm  
this is so sort of a feeling that we had but hadn't shown  
and it goes like  
the next phase um sebastian um is um the design of the look and feel  
in the master class  
and one about whether it's on um one of the mouse positions  
yep  
mm mm  
sorry  
and then the actual file we can probably like copy from your home directory or something like it  
uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll volume button  
okay  
yeah  
that also might be interesting for you detecting emotion  
yep  
it's cold in the winter  
sorry about that  
channel five  
um i hope that's not not the case  
yeah it's rubber made of rubber i think it's <unk> it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control  
and you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate  
i'm sorry  
yep  
no  
yeah a <unk> front or whatever  
i thought it was everything was generated on the fly th so  
so i reckon  
so how long does this put you back for  
and then the final one where you get to call it hal  
we wanted it all to be  
okay  
um um with kind of arrow shapes which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh  
uh we just chose simple shapes for all them  
let's  
hmm  
yeah  
um  
basically <unk> like i mean if you <unk> if you see a lot of papers on like um on uh voice over i. p. or whatever  
it's always like that  
and you're right there as well  
i think a two  
alright  
okay  
now if you don't really detect the pitch <unk> can say that uh no persons  
and uh um you know we we've got an algorithm for deciding when that's a look i guess  
where's the pen  
yeah  
no we're under  
and does that count  
uh divide me this bunch of documents into five topics and you don't give them the topics a <unk> you know  
yeah  
um i'm from the state of maine in the us  
yeah  
uh i don't know which material can be spongy and if you  
but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing  
yeah  
yeah  
or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons  
yeah  
okay  
yeah the the the problem with <unk> for me is that you have to i put in the <unk> made chunks <unk> as well  
does that seem right then  
oh  
so i'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that because they're very  
uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control but it's only a single remote control  
well so it was the whole all the dynamic region part of it that's uh  
yeah  
is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords  
it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions and to find your way around it  
oh  
i think so  
<unk> everybody's got their different ways of doing these things  
okay so this is just about the technical functions  
mm  
plastic wood rubber titanium special colour  
so the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore as it's something that's  
you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight  
okay  
um the voice function <unk> with the infrared uh issue  
integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of <unk> just the push button  
mm  
yeah  
uh  
uh it's right i mean  
yeah maybe <unk> is a good thing to do  
okay  
yay  
but if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do you can turn it  
yeah right  
there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one t. v. and  
no i don't think so  
yeah 'cause i  
i i copied mine before i sent it over  
usually i would do a lot more <unk> too but i didn't because  
um  
yes  
so just a little bit of ad additional information in the display that knows where meetings picking it over  
yeah that's that's possible  
so if we try to push the buttons it you think it's possible  
very good  
so there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market  
um  
mm-hmm  
blah  
yeah so  
um this is particularly geared towards children  
yeah i th think it's not the most spongy thing  
yeah just add them and then uh divide them  
okay yeah  
yeah  
you know what  
but th yeah  
yeah well uh actually it is  
sixty  
well  
any questions so far  
no you had penn tree bank <unk> and you made chunks from that  
'cause yeah that <unk> more than finding it  
double a.  
yeah  
yeah alright  
there are <unk> more papers which are using this approach like trying to encode the magnitude spectrum or <unk>  
uh okay  
just uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday  
from me of course yeah  
uh partly but you have to print on the number  
ostensibly booked time which isn't  
<unk> ought to be <unk> and uh  
oh okay  
it it hung  
has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice <unk> recognition system to respond to um with standard responses  
yeah  
they are  
but we're not sure if we can actually make that  
of course maybe there was the ah one hundred seventy shots or it's a lot  
i'm from melbourne and i'm your project manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together  
the edges are too sharp  
mm  
like uh  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
how does it work  
i didn't read it  
alright then  
hmm  
yeah  
i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet just keep that in mind  
so what i had basically going from the <unk> format is that uh yeah yeah i like this a lot  
i mean you can do everything you want in one series  
yeah  
yellow  
yeah  
but coffee breaks are probably more like ab or are gonna be a better time  
we have coyotes howl all the time  
uh children can still go up to the t. v. <unk> pop open uh the thing and and and <unk>  
actually we have a message here from <unk> about the poster session  
in my opinion it is no because of the nature of the language  
yeah  
mm  
so you must uh the the the the functions know  
well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing  
pepper  
uh i  
yeah  
uh i think olivier prepared some slides about uh reviewing uh  
wow  
um because you se  
yeah yeah  
so now yeah now you can write another paper if you can  
yeah  
yeah  
people i thought maybe  
yeah  
uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television  
oh  
the screen has to be square  
okay so you're worried about what's the range of exchange types for this genre and that's what you think hasn't been done  
huh  
ah it looks like a dog  
like selecting the menus  
okay so i  
okay  
it's uh pretty hard to write  
or even  
ten milliseconds means you have only eighty samples for uh and then you have refused twenty four filters the filters won't get any samples so  
sorry  
okay  
yeah  
that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily  
boy let me tell you  
yeah  
six or five  
okay so i have your slides somewhere  
um now you probably have to <unk>  
mm  
mm  
okay then yeah  
let's keep it in  
yeah  
well for example the power button you can if someone is constantly <unk> zapping  
that's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing  
if they want to do <unk> it may not be sure of that  
yeah  
mm yes <unk> when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price  
and of course the energy source  
okay okay  
well so  
oh right  
mm-hmm  
perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it  
that's all i got  
yeah  
well  
then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option  
changing the casing  
okay that's a problem for the data models and either of the things that we were using  
mm-hmm  
mm mm-hmm  
scroll  
participant two  
yeah it is but i know i know uh th this is just a theory  
yeah  
so what we had is we had the method  
the overlapping is different right  
and it will activate um plus yeah it's price is really  
so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the <unk> where <unk> osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray  
yeah  
yeah  
right  
zap does that just mean like changing the channel  
so yeah  
amount of buttons  
if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing that's gonna be quite a change  
i say lose the curve  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so i think <unk> two is better  
yeah  
you were slow too so  
<unk> to do now is to decide how to <unk> what your stuff is so in that sense so it does kind of make sense yeah  
no one will understand  
yeah well uh  
um  
yeah who knows  
what we've finally just uh at twelve o'clock today looks like we've got it <unk> um is to get one channel one microphone being the left channel and one being the right channel to merge into a stereo single file  
yeah  
oh my god and we've all been a pretty congenial team here i think  
well there's no reason why it can't swap meetings at the moment if the data's there for it  
do you have any preference uh of order  
and also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels  
yeah  
no  
and secondly maybe we will use this box you know to get uh data  
'cause if you use a memory display on the t. v.  
and what we actually need to do and what the remote control needs to do  
this however may exclude certain um materials  
try a  
remote  
internet something like that  
um but furthermore  
i just don't know  
yeah sure  
that all goes  
has anyone ever seen anything from the other group  
so colour robustness easy to use size yeah size matters yeah  
once you have done this this is can be this can be done quite quickly  
yeah  
yeah yep  
yeah yeah yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
it's it's a six  
you are nameless  
you survived s. p. one and s. p. two  
mm-hmm  
um because i think that's <unk> what you have been doing earlier on  
no  
uh well it's obvious obviously new  
'kay  
okay let's <unk> evaluate uh the product of us our design  
user <unk> is very important yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
well i mean uh it just comes down to the to the mere fact that word error rate is just take the words  
for example when i was uh you know harmonic voice <unk> that h. m. m. system which is using used for synthesis more less  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
i mean uh you know i i <unk>  
i think for test i can take the real demo and make the the full processing  
pinball  
that that is one think unlike the say the <unk> or anything  
what would be the difference  
okay  
you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it  
there's the minutes from the first meeting  
no because no it's not very a lot  
next thirty minutes to design something so  
oh  
folder  
if it browse  
no it looks great  
and then we will evaluate it given the criteria that um that we gave  
yeah that's what we make it up  
meeting  
it takes like hundred times more than computing some m. f. c. c. <unk> computing these features because it's uh huge d. c. t. huge f. f. t. everywhere  
yeah  
hmm  
either speech  
i dunno if it can fit with the technology  
current colour red  
but if we wanna make fifty million and and have everyone want this remote control we should maybe  
it might be it might take half an hour in the display and not more than that  
oh <unk>  
mm-hmm  
maybe you could use your remote as a phone  
so  
they should be able to to share information easily  
no  
i i <unk> i would like them to be in the same cluster  
oh  
so for example if there was a directional microphone pointing there you would get most of my energy but less from you et cetera  
what's your <unk> and password  
oh  
uh maybe not the prototype  
as as for the colour what what do you think  
so that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it adjust it click again and then you're out of it  
and um try to draw  
if we were to to have one  
so maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the l. c. d.  
i think <unk>  
i suppose it  
yeah  
r. s. i. is it good against  
i <unk> mailed them to you  
animal  
um  
as a source type  
uh  
do you know what i'm saying  
but i'm <unk> i'm sure open to to market this in either direction  
that's just a little marketing idea that could be applied so you can <unk> it appeals to really everyone  
yeah something like that i can recover  
or in the u. v.  
exactly  
which is not as the case with uh with <unk> and  
whereas this time you're really getting it from a database source so it's not uh well uh anyway  
yeah i've got the indexes for all the meetings i think  
and uh afterwards uh we closing  
mm  
maybe  
yeah  
that's just wrong  
yes  
uh i think that was planned at the beginning wasn't it  
well you can erase it with the eraser but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page but just create a new blank one  
and also it has to be attractive of course because if you want to sale to sell the remote control  
right  
currently but uh up to december i don't have time to work on it  
we'll also know <unk> when the next meeting is i um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task  
yeah  
so  
okay  
uh  
without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know <unk> massive  
that'll be the exactly yeah  
or maybe even insert picture  
okay good  
so it's <unk> i think it's really easy to use  
yeah  
okay  
oh yeah do you want you know how you've just got data for one meeting are you needing more at the moment  
basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by  
i need to make it special with a high price tag  
okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting  
uh <unk>  
somehow work out how we can get this all <unk> in the same place  
so did did you have to combine them all and and then re order them  
mm  
okay that's <unk> not so  
is there anything you want to add  
okay so from that um as we've already said we need to focus on a fancy look and feel  
okay i draw  
hmm  
a little bit more inspired  
yeah  
uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work  
uh aye  
yeah  
yeah well it was actually this pressure from from my group that led to this to squeeze a little bit uh the place of the lounge  
um the scroll buttons as you've already mentioned um  
uh i say that it's different i what i'm looking for as marketing is <unk> give me something different  
okay  
oh yeah it is yeah  
mm-hmm  
can i show them on the on the big screen  
mm  
yeah  
thank you  
reasonably spongy i guess yeah  
i dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements  
okay  
i would think is  
you have your energy source right there which then um brings  
yes  
but still they use a code book no  
yeah  
why not introduce it in this way  
um thirty five  
yeah it's too big it's too fat  
right  
yeah  
yes  
so something like that  
fact i dunno if you noticed but i wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen i thought that was kinda nice  
uh for instance uh d. v. d. players cell phones video and audio equipment  
if if you don't take that into account there's plenty of room for <unk> creativity  
so  
no is it  
hmm  
yeah like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours  
mm  
that's as far as it goes  
do you have a rabbit at home  
oh okay  
well that would make them quite small  
right well that's the end of my presentation  
see what was on the agenda  
oh never i i don't wanna interrupt it  
wait  
hmm  
for the user requirements  
is it you know  
yeah yep  
<unk> uh uh it's a yeah it's uh the most simple uh animal i know i think  
and have well yeah i've wrote something down about how it works  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
so just an extra  
or it's something like isn't hardware the first one  
well  
yeah definitely  
okay very good  
hmm  
okay  
th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about because it charges itself up by doing it  
yeah  
so i  
instead of rubber let it be plastic  
yeah that's that that that's enough because  
but the quality again problem no like  
yes just why not  
so beep  
yeah  
i <unk> but <unk> yeah <unk>  
mm-hmm  
i mean you know a sixteen year old boy would say yeah i'd pay extra for voice recognition until they <unk> that's three months allowance  
yeah  
and and it's just like fiona was saying um that the the word that stands out is something really uh aberrant  
we can have <unk> colours or this shape or at least yeah  
that isn't possible  
yeah sure  
no no it's very simple  
working  
mute button  
ah it's designed for a <unk> okay  
or multiple digits  
we could say that if you throw it you have a sensor and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off  
your <unk>  
mm-hmm  
and uh not in a classroom setting but in a social place where they could gather  
mm-hmm  
i'm going to go to that next slide and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven  
uh can you give an indication in <unk> uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with l. c. d. or without  
uh uh okay  
um  
festival is able to to to read just a mm normal plain text in reasonable comprehensible english or so that i can understand it  
but i mean you can do other work if you consider in terms of speaker turns or in terms of slides and that is immediately multiply  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that would kind of lose it  
i closed it  
and there is also one big table that he used he used to yeah  
did you were you all pleased with the process as it was  
okay  
<unk>  
yeah but  
well but you don't i mean at this point you don't really care because  
okay  
mm  
mm  
and uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t. v. <unk>  
you remember when steve came in steve whittaker came in at the end and said you know  
yeah  
um  
we can come together in a meeting and and discuss what what um what kind of functional design we want to use  
you would have some mu much more agreement between people than than if you look at the <unk> sets people would would just cut at some precise uh point  
fiscally solvent  
um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you  
i <unk> i suppose um  
well uh probably at the side  
yeah i know that just extends it as well  
just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever  
yeah  
big  
even it is for <unk> just some kids you know switching channels one two three four  
hmm  
i like that  
yeah  
yeah  
cool  
no i think uh i really think it's <unk> because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash  
good luck  
'kay  
yeah also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour  
perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should  
only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons  
no  
mm-hmm  
twelve fifty  
well yes um we uh we should try to <unk> to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way  
thank you  
so so just change sound to whatever you like just go through the windows control panel  
so i guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're we're targeting and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into  
yeah  
uh i  
no we don't have push button  
i think that's something that's very hard to catch so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something  
you can go to the next slide  
yeah  
you you have all of these no  
oh it doesn't have any on does it  
yeah  
<unk>  
i'm <unk> <unk>  
right  
okay  
and about five or six breaks in the between is the making it a  
um yeah that's good question  
just pure text so that i can get a dictionary and you can work on that for your topic segmentation  
like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there  
yeah  
but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff that would be tuned to one channel  
ah it's still working like it should do  
mm-hmm  
i i think i will let uh our user interface designer speak first mister david jordan  
<unk> but but the survey did say that <unk> things like voice recognition are more popular with them so if you want to put in something stylish  
oh  
but i think we'd also wanna go for <unk> a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down  
should do it good one  
mm  
mm bit like this  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> th that's that's easy  
from fro for checking <unk> code et cetera we can expect until uh  
uh  
where are we putting things  
yeah uh yeah i don't know  
mm  
yeah  
because  
yeah  
product manager okay let's go i will try  
yeah  
so we're not so confined by one style and say some you know  
yeah  
and it might be different enough that that actually causes it not to match  
we we we why  
you have to press <unk> very hard to go to the next channel  
i <unk> i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the <unk> display  
ho how does it work  
three  
okay  
yeah  
so it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control  
yeah  
<unk>  
yeah yeah  
and you can also um let's see i think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen  
any questions  
um  
i think we can make a docking station  
it was from virgin islands  
and um  
yeah yeah  
mm  
mm  
save us the bother then that's you know vast amounts of sales  
yeah they're windows yeah  
damn  
and an and  
add them  
it's very big yeah  
okay yeah  
continuum radiation  
go ahead  
well we we could make more more oval or something and and  
and i think maybe not because i've got a remote and i'll take it to different chairs  
mm  
okay  
yeah it's two different situations  
that's what we're focused on  
um mm basic and um so i need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want  
yeah  
okay we're gonna wrap this up now  
mm  
yeah  
and want and it uh uh do it has to be a simple design which sturdy which soft  
okay so we don't exactly need the single we don't need a curve  
because uh i agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself  
mm  
yeah if you're just sitting there going  
from the account manager  
but most of the time mobiles they use <unk> d. t. w. kind of thing no like  
we basically used um some focus group surveys which i went through with you last time the main results of that  
on once it's on it's on  
apple  
yeah  
yes maybe we can uh <unk> uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh  
um then if you know if people lose the cover  
so guys  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
oh <unk> i wanted i wanted to extend this uh well actually the paper we wanted to write was uh for <unk> was something related to multi stream gamma  
we've got almost everything we can  
you were just <unk> really gonna run a video of the <unk> of the trial  
<unk> with h. beta absorption you'd put in  
let's make a party first maybe  
yeah  
uh sub threshold yeah  
or  
oh okay  
mm  
more time domain  
okay  
and is the project evaluated yes it is  
it's not overwhelmed  
next slide please  
maybe put minus two so it looks uh more reasonable  
yeah  
like some primitive thing working next week  
when you have the same amount of button you have to put in <unk> in your carton  
basically what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them  
oh really  
we've got a rubber uh case materials supplements  
but can we delete it just with delete  
i mean perhaps i screwed up because i <unk> put a put a speech recognition into it  
but i think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the know th th in functions you have  
not too much colours  
we've got a battery one or <unk> two batteries or not  
maybe if you just do it once at the highest level it it will be fine  
bye  
so we take the some of those and divide them by by the number or something create the average and put it in as the value for the segment  
you all have to <unk> you'll have to be there to when it falls over  
which you could press and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was hopefully in the room  
uh okay but which which likelihood ratio  
okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here  
so the components i quickly draw here  
maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l. c. d. and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced  
right  
and and this was the problem actually because you were  
okay  
made me really like ooh i don't know throwing together <unk> out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite  
i have no idea how one would explain this  
then it's out of budget  
t. a. r. i. k.  
yeah  
or what  
mm-hmm  
no  
five  
yeah  
that a question we can ask  
everyone has a t. v. remote but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit  
like is there any way yeah  
so we'll we have only one  
so should we get so are definite was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has  
often  
yeah  
well yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah  
yeah  
huh  
i like i like the <unk> buttons as well  
there we go  
<unk>  
it's registered as a a detection  
hmm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah mine too  
no re yeah but that's that's not good direct bus is not good like  
you think  
mm  
well i i think that norman and i would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting or  
i wasn't expecting that  
and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting  
yeah uh the uh is fancy  
to the picture of the kiddie one  
seven  
basically you use just four or five channels right  
the last one is uh intelligent controller  
oh yeah yeah yeah mm  
goo and good luck so  
yeah it's true  
and we're only fifteen if you don't count <unk> and some visitor's place  
okay  
anyway so you want to a little more like this  
yeah  
okay cool  
uh  
so  
okay anybody  
but i mean like we we should discuss together which <unk> like how the the search interacts with the rest  
yeah  
yeah  
okay uh the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the <unk> the same as before  
so  
yeah maybe to explain this method was using uh a simple uh uh distance between uh consecutive histograms  
uh  
groovy  
it it is it is is is it gives a <unk> it's more robust that way  
and  
i think so i i you know and i think we've co we have come we've come up with something new  
sorry  
yeah  
so i <unk> what was i gonna put for that  
and also you can if you i  
mm-hmm  
if we choose titanium uh we cannot use more than one curve  
uh but uh will there uh uh like the first idea uh from uh you can buy it without and uh with parental <unk> control  
yeah  
how we can just have a slide bar which we can read and write to which is in a frame of that type  
yeah  
um and we'd better be careful about the time as well  
never have to change a battery again  
four  
i know  
change the channel change the volume  
so that gives you two different kinds a more complex and more simple version  
that that sort of approach  
whilst you know some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it  
uh  
yes  
mm yeah not done that yet  
yeah i'd agree  
twenty five euros  
it's a <unk> a little bit too flashy  
no  
so we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh  
almost done  
do you use our setup for the number of states  
'kay  
i don't know what order it goes in  
personal preferences  
yeah  
one and two  
the plastic  
well at different bit rates  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
it doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote  
and note that the push button just requires a simple chip so that would keep the price down  
uh no problem  
not really  
not used very often  
alright  
oh yeah  
the uh the the digits in black  
um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle <unk> a wonderful thing um  
yes i think so  
i come to some uh personal experience findings possible solutions later  
yep  
and then um a. <unk> eye is on well a. <unk> mouse i guess right  
so our hope is essentially that we load less into it  
on this <unk>  
okay  
yeah  
it  
so we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there  
yeah  
oh well whatever  
yeah  
just the material  
um  
well according to the to the report people are more interested in in a <unk> fancy look and feel and in a technological <unk> in innovation  
yeah  
um i haven't been able to  
and uh well then we have a cover basically basically you don't need much of the time this  
well it looked more than a bunny than a cat but it works right  
so maybe you can include that somewhere  
therefore they're more with handling them therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on  
no oh  
like i've seen phones like a okay  
<unk> yeah  
okay um and that's the end of the slide show  
and so so that mean that um  
yeah  
uh for example if <unk> if you put all the  
'kay  
oh it's very costly microphone array  
uh they've dumped the pilot the pilot studies that they generated based on the task with their english participants or english speaking participants  
nah  
'cause there would be less impact maybe  
you might want  
but uh don't uh  
no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to  
do you wanna just give us a moment i just wanna copy this down  
they are no more for channel or <unk> volume  
so we're having a a general menu with the most used functions uh teletext screen settings  
and one more time  
have you have you been thinking about what you would like to to do in in in place of this  
so  
yeah  
one speaker and dom dom dominant one in the spectrum of that <unk> uh carrier <unk> hilbert carrier and you just transmit this parameter  
it's the maximum fashion  
i'm looking for things in the name  
i think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of  
mm  
no but  
yeah you could check with the excel sheet  
yeah  
mm  
listening more  
teletext is gone  
yeah  
it's up to you to evaluate yeah  
what do you mean  
yeah it's a two  
mm-hmm  
as we said um but it does have the push buttons or the scroll buttons  
if it's reliable enough  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and also displaying the speakers before an utterance  
but are you going to draw it  
or should we start it if we start the conversation in the common room like is laughter linguistic then they could come up with a theory  
so um  
you you need to be able to hold it so  
i'll give it a three  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
right  
before we move on  
uh well basically what that says we discuss it and um  
more or less  
anyway so this is the basic design we wanna have um on and off what are we missing  
are good ideas what are not  
yeah  
well if it does then we can't  
uh a <unk> are are you also considering that you could actually look at the relationship between meetings for instance  
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach  
well i guess you know apple has the ipod so <unk> just 'cause they have an apple on their  
i except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and i knew we were all lying through our teeth other than that  
sorry heather  
yeah out of forty nine with with zero being the highest  
maybe it would help us  
i'm fine  
no not on the front but on the backside  
yeah  
no no actually the <unk>  
oh ho ho  
that's pretty much it  
as in they want it to do a lot of good <unk> they want it to look like it does a lot  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that i think we would've necessarily chosen  
i'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself  
no  
if if so if this is page rank of x. page rank of y.  
oh that could be that <unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
and i think that says it all really  
'cause for these two types of discourse uh the uh  
so i mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky <unk> mm mm yeah  
things like that  
well that's great  
yeah  
uh  
just a little antenna or uh something  
so but uh  
then let's do it because starting run time is now getting to be fairly urgent  
yeah  
but but the thing is when you use a remote control you never look at it right  
mm i'd put multiple in there  
they said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote  
was it the case that the representation of the utterances and the relations included which speaker was uh  
okay  
so one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand  
i like the menu  
three uh two two point seven or something like that  
okay  
easy to use  
mm-hmm  
<unk> us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate  
then i think okay i'll let that in but if if it comes out and like one word is  
yeah  
which later on is being is being transferred to a infrared lamp which  
you need space for four desks  
conti continuum  
keyboard work  
we come out on a average of two one eighth  
so because we'd basically it would be good to have two different ones to play around with  
on the <unk> uh-huh  
yeah  
yeah although i don't think that's very <unk>  
this device  
yeah  
no the curve doesn't really  
i agree  
so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend  
we changed it so that you could  
um so things that seem like absolute must haves uh would be a volume control  
but it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing  
you know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it  
but uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that  
even if it does it automatically in the beginning as a start up option just to ask for a file name  
mm-hmm  
ma  
because um you know some people tend to stutter more than others and then they would have a false start four or five times in a row  
mm i think it's what we say that we have an uh an l. c. d. with uh information  
and then when you check it in it will automatically be registered even though the the first pass was checked in when we're doing this checking in business  
oh  
and see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out  
yeah  
whether you want to or not you're not gonna lose it  
since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything but uh we might uh consider that  
do you think that we have a person that has this will help you  
<unk>  
don't you think  
you know make it more trendy and original  
um yeah  
uh and after that and the major point is to <unk> combine both  
the quality uh quality of all the components really i mean we can't really do anything shoddy work 'cause it's  
so  
right  
the <unk> uh communication is one way so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control at least i don't think you can  
actually  
fair enough  
if you use a phone  
actually is abundance really in a way  
the l. c. d. screen  
<unk> <unk>  
and what about the price of this component  
yeah because i think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that i dunno  
yeah  
it's better for  
right  
they're  
you said the user algorithm might be wrong  
mm-hmm okay  
um  
um use the o. e. d. to check on things you don't know about  
yeah it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand  
i don't understand it  
it yeah  
yeah i think we've listened to everybody  
frequencies  
it's totally broken  
um we have or good shape yes  
good in in flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down  
we haven't got remote controls for uh well i think yeah  
yeah  
don't you think  
search for the buttons which one is which and uh  
well i i didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not  
um <unk> i'm confused about everything  
and now i did the same uh on uh the other meetings which were available where well it's only three meetings because well here there are four of them which are from the test set uh from the ami <unk> <unk> but only three of them have uh slides  
i gave this a one because of the rubber  
yeah  
we dropped the scroll wheel  
uh it's the same  
i don't the <unk> the bowl shape people like  
right  
<unk> what is this strange beast  
sample sensor sample speaker  
that's important  
i'm a little bit confused  
well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
say a <unk> about say a <unk> about this size right so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan say even for that  
okay cool  
well the <unk> gonna use the importance  
'cause they're they're hand marking stuff and the dialogue act boundaries are supposed to be intentional  
i don't know  
yeah  
um yes but but i do maybe you can give a hand to us because i i'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents  
'kay  
yeah  
yeah the panel just uh of course goes like this  
okay  
hmm  
uh  
teletext is in the menu  
mm-hmm  
both for the young and the old what they like  
so we might want to build in a feature to uh support them  
mm  
so this is the same video a the the a. v. i. number one  
of uh yeah and the mute and the the other button  
<unk> grips on the side here i guess  
yeah  
because it was that now  
but um otherwise i can still keep working on it improving it i think  
yeah  
that sounds good  
right  
so <unk> yeah we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on l. c. d.  
hmm  
we can give it a one because compared to every other remote ever <unk> ever made this one will be easier to find  
hmm  
mm 'kay  
mm ma maybe that's something to consider yes so  
i think that uh it's a nice design  
my sheet is very uh filled up  
i also did a little research on um  
must brain storm  
can you fit any uh for example a t. f. t. or any electronic device in a spongy thing or is there any problem for that  
yeah yeah i'm sure  
do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh yeah to be able to use it as well  
right  
and i think only  
we haven't really decided what to do about that  
yeah  
yeah we'll be doing  
'kay so i'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design  
maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment and if something comes back  
yeah  
if i mean <unk> if one of the people doing <unk> has some named entity code to spare  
we need a lot of extra buttons  
are we done  
depth  
volume  
we'll just take the take the round button suppose  
and then everybody was <unk> totally confused i guess  
then you can get rid of the lounge  
my mouse is uh  
sorry i'm sorry  
because it was at a certain point  
yeah  
so they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room  
yeah  
so we see we can even forecast  
yeah the the browser  
yeah  
oh  
uh yeah  
the casing is curved single curved  
it looks like a now you took it  
yeah true  
yeah we yeah yeah yeah exactly  
so uh  
we're in an <unk> room which we specially yeah built an <unk>  
at this point in time they were looking at the new parts area or they were looking at the target  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
ah  
yeah that that's yeah  
yeah i know sure it <unk> like it it would not necessary need to be a part of the final thing  
we just want to retrieve the content and then <unk> sort them by the types of <unk>  
okay um now i wanna bring us down to earth again i'm afraid and talk about the actual <unk> of how the thing needs to work  
they're a bit small you can we should stretch them because  
yeah  
remote control mainly be sold to younger people  
okay  
this one  
mm uh no  
ah  
yeah okay  
it's supposed to fix it rather than cause it  
so i guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options  
so you can you can always <unk> you can put some thresholds and pruning and then you can make it real time  
yeah  
uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this t. f. t. screen  
i  
any other ideas or thoughts  
oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah  
yeah 'cause yeah i just i don't see the cross over between computers and television  
more complicated ones but <unk> all still in one  
uh just we can start a new one  
yes yellow  
um so  
so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because i think in the product it is important  
so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls  
well you wanted to do the <unk> on the ami data right  
any problem  
i don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the the top casing  
interface  
<unk> <unk> without recharge  
so that's why um uh if we look on the relationship that uh exists between the speech and the slides uh the task of improving the recognition  
yeah  
so we'll see if we can get like a mini browser just displays two things <unk> together of some kind  
the only thing you don't get is the clock  
but well there one for the sound and one for the channels  
so yeah  
yeah just a bit a bit childish a bit  
now let's have uh a bottle of champagne  
is just a pain  
well i do that but okay and um  
okay i don't think we need to screw it in  
and the button that you can go to a. v. for your video  
and another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult  
mm-hmm  
yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh yeah useful  
i mean these are all the different ways of taking cross products at the things that could be co located  
i love it  
it's <unk>  
maybe we could <unk> the question we were thinking about  
<unk> yeah yeah actually 'cause uh i've looked uh  
you don't know of  
yeah  
yeah  
doesn't matter  
do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it so um i'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board  
okay  
it be <unk> depends on the position  
they're cheap  
that that's more <unk> apparatus than you should actually need for um from doing this kind of analysis  
or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside  
well you need the raw frequency as well  
well that's that's uh okay so project evaluation  
yeah  
for for the advanced functions i think  
i think we did yeah i think we did quite well  
yeah  
yeah we might need a scroll wheel right for that  
okay  
welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project  
shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first  
no i've just yeah straight forward and then you just right right yeah <unk> and right click things in in windows explorer  
yeah but they don't they don't like it  
which seems like it would be really hard in an open domain  
yep  
okay  
i  
and then we will have <unk> particular channel so users can listen  
sorry  
yeah  
so i'm not sure about uh on your side <unk> what's your yeah  
um okay  
um and  
what it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly i need it  
that's okay  
oh we're pretty much missing an okay button but we have a button up there which is still free  
basically plastic gives you the <unk> biggest variety of of options  
thin oh there it i five minutes to go  
well thank you  
and same for the for the volume buttons and the the <unk>  
but it's like two thirds of the way down a quite a long page  
then maybe you know  
one curve simple  
okay  
that would make it stand out  
yeah i think  
mm-hmm  
well i think uh the case is double curved then  
you can have  
or comfortable you know um so  
right right  
yeah and also parameter changing  
yeah  
so you could use like this and it would go  
but is in general the language and not certain words  
would they feel it's too empty and that we have too much space  
anyone wanna play i spy  
yeah pretty cool  
but do you have any like feeling that whether they go for all these new features or they usually use only mm  
so i uh make new page and uh be creative  
mm  
you don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel  
uh i dunno  
fine  
but i don't even know how to play this  
um yeah some some fancy lights  
uh <unk>  
<unk>  
um and you can still track the children of that construct  
<unk> find a niche for our remote like market it to a certain kind of <unk> kind of people  
it's it's such a <unk> like lot of time involved so you can't really check many <unk>  
the the buttons or pictures or something  
so you have sleek stylish sophisticated you know so something that's you know a bit cool  
then we have case material supplements interface type and then button supplements  
um  
well if you do this  
put the fashion in electronics so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable it's a big concern of ours  
let's start over again then  
okay well maybe if i can interrupt you maybe i should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision  
it's more appropriate somehow  
so one two three four five six seven eight nine <unk>  
well  
alright  
we just have a ball  
maybe we'll hear differently but for now  
well hopefully most people will <unk> either have something like <unk> or they'll just have uh p. d. f. slides or something  
case but it's but i don't know with twenty <unk>  
give it a one  
i i'm just coming back to our initial idea of presenting some you know  
i think it worked quite well  
yeah  
uh  
on the chip itself and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is  
okay  
i can then  
it doesn't get in the way of seeing what's underneath  
as long as it comes out in the end  
i think it's not as if it's a although it's four widths half maximum it's still the <unk> the line within it  
yeah listen and yeah <unk> yeah even uh they it's mostly they use native speakers only because they can really judge well so  
the so it meant three okay  
like if <unk> you be exactly the same as sinusoidal coding or something like that  
yeah  
why not  
mm  
don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on t. v. or or well systems that exist that we can use  
okay  
um so i guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um  
yeah but i was i was i was more thinking of the sort of the the whole browser framework as a running programme now  
are you are you <unk>  
yeah yeah  
who would like to go first  
um i'm just trying to understand what this segments file is about  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh personal preferences uh to save money for the components the remote should be mass produced and basic materials should be bought en masse  
it feels soft  
okay  
you we could choose uh what uh what's better plastic um or rubber  
we'll be meeting again in thirty minutes  
mm-hmm  
'cause it's just the wee control yeah thing that's behind it  
mm  
how much would that save us  
no one does  
me too  
uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay  
um  
<unk> but uh <unk> but uh uh basically <unk> just you know if we finish uh discussing this first  
f. five okay sorry  
uh getting uh having the possibility of using x. l. r. microphone could be uh uh could be neat  
well we have extended menus on the on the l. c. d. screen  
i dunno  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
<unk> okay so charger for is the  
four  
yeah  
mm the shared folder  
yeah yeah  
so you know  
yeah  
yeah  
would  
i think <unk> did  
it was for something else h. alpha detection  
right  
no no it is even in d. v. d. form we have it that the  
we can think about t. v. with you know where you can change you know the aspects <unk> like for the cell phones you know  
um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom  
<unk> that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea  
it's not too difficult to do and it's sort of a hack kind of way 'cause we can just treat it all as one meeting  
fancy  
alright  
that's uh yeah is that that's a good idea  
so that's it  
you do need the uh multi or did uh no like this one  
yeah  
in any case i didn't hear anything and and you shouldn't be transcribing in breaths or out breaths  
for you said if it good for d. v. d. then i would  
let's make everything a two  
and then talk about how the annotation for information density and stuff should maybe be structured in a similar way  
so it's well outside the budget then  
so  
yeah  
because you know it's a self contained system as opposed to a system which is which can't be interpreted without the other system  
yeah  
okay  
uh two  
mm-hmm  
okay  
well there was stuff in the seventies and the eighties right  
it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t. v. <unk> or or whatever  
try to get it right  
yeah  
the prototype yeah  
yeah i i would say we do yeah  
but  
it's actually got a separate track for each part  
well i could could uh have a look at that maybe  
so  
no not  
suppose so  
yeah uh new ways of doing financial  
and then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this  
so you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else wherever the remote actually is  
mm  
so i have no clue what we're actually doing at the moment  
okay  
if you don't put it  
'cause you know it's not that attractive an area to walk through if you're not gonna get anything out of it  
yeah  
yep  
you can look at the video and play it uh  
um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there  
how much of your <unk> was already done for you every meeting  
mm yeah  
i have all my answers yes  
not not many we we want to keep it simple  
well i was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling by by these kinds of sticks or something like that  
maybe after they have this and they may say okay just by looking at least the summary  
how much um well  
there's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at i can't remember and then they whistle back or something like that  
because if we use a universal remote control we're going to have to have most buttons on it so  
i would break it  
great  
yeah  
there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different  
just 'cause that was lower priority  
okay  
which are kind of hidden away in some way or  
project documents yeah  
um  
if if nothing if nothing else you <unk> uh if nothing else you can do it in a <unk> script  
two down  
um they're in the l. c. d. panel and the jog dial  
hmm  
nah  
and i think we should probably increase that  
well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle  
yeah  
so it's better to uh put our attention to the the design  
i think the left <unk> under corner should be the best  
think she's finishing up her presentation  
and the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance  
finger here with the buttons  
'kay guys take it away  
yeah  
the ami data is is there  
we are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing  
yeah  
i just keep pressing lots of 'em  
okay  
uh that's the little menu key  
but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important but also the number of buttons  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
it's feels kind <unk> spongy  
it isn't it  
or just um v. l. b. a.  
i dunno  
yeah kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> press f. five to start it first  
that's nice to know one from each of you  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
that's not a separate source  
i i've i think we've uh <unk> succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good  
we also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control  
um actually seventy five percent of the users find <unk> the most remote controls uh ugly okay so that's  
'kay  
yeah  
yeah i know what you mean  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so which you see the which is de <unk> one of the most expensive parts  
or  
so now we have to kill them both  
<unk>  
black  
and uh very cheap l. c. d. <unk> so liquid crystal displays so i'm wondering i think we might be able to integrate l. c. d. into our r. c.  
yeah that that can be done already  
mm-hmm  
why not  
mm-hmm  
continuum radiation  
then then we have to think of something else right  
if you have a pop up screen  
so if you wanna take this  
yeah  
yes but some television don't support it  
and then it shifts the whole frame and it alerts every single element of the display and the display updates  
and what functions it needs to complete  
i mean we are using data that are fake  
looks good  
whistle and it screams at you yeah  
um right so  
as you can see all of these phases consists of two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far  
you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel  
decisions  
why not  
what were we gonna do about flux  
we lose our whole concept  
well  
i it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not  
okay let us make this l. and without l. c. d.  
yeah  
i don't  
what are we missing  
uh this middle button here brings up the on screen menu and when you're working in the on screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select  
we're having a  
i think so yeah so then i have those number of stages  
so since our product meets all these requirements so i would also prefer to give it rank one  
with the minus and the plus  
or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both but you know i at my side prefer a wireless  
you can draw something which is very simple  
uh okay  
yeah  
um the would and <unk>  
well it's different  
so you know  
this will be the buttons  
mm-hmm  
that's that that that that's their uh their view  
yeah i if it was absorption at h. alpha that would all be one  
yeah it just i mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too right  
huh  
fruity  
are there some other very important things to to do well  
well <unk> but make it a separate option in the menu so that it's it's <unk> dis displayed from uh displayed here so uh parents uh  
there's a hand powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago  
<unk> you know where that is just about  
sure  
okay and if we go to the next slide here you can find these are the latest fashion updates  
well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no  
so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple  
how much disruption does this cause  
okay  
yeah  
um first of all um if you make minutes yourself as well uh like sebastian does um could you put them on the shared folder  
yeah but what he said about r. s. i.  
no  
um power is used like once per hour channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour  
i just came from glasgow and i'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately  
yeah  
so  
yeah i've derived that i've derived that myself  
she's on the move  
the final copy  
good  
so what do you think  
it's on top of using the button  
the finance bit and the excel project and the we've done the redesign  
uh okay <unk> to volunteer  
yeah i guess  
no  
i think tracking  
hey is it interesting for users if we put led lights under the buttons  
um and when you get further down yeah you see those with very low prob um score also have um no agreements  
well the <unk> fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the t. v.  
but do you know this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling  
yeah yeah  
th this th th there's two two functions  
maybe a bic uh better uh white uh we white  
well the don'ts  
to make it beep  
yeah  
that i know  
wood is <unk> is is is cheaper than rubber  
um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn  
yeah i think so  
um in in a slight subtle way  
so no um <unk> no transcriber will be checking no checker will be checking their <unk> own transcription  
we just need that actually  
like that  
uh it's uh the same as the last time  
yeah  
uh the costs are within the budget  
yeah yeah  
what can you do to like make the infra red more functional like why would it not be  
here we just use uh the et ethernet network to <unk> uh these two um these two device  
question is if you're not quicker if you uh because you should get massive compression out of that  
i'll say five  
um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else  
i haven't looked through other mail  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i if we have for example broad absorption line object we mark that  
transfer  
whatever um makes sense to you  
production cost was were <unk> uh was twenty two  
okay single  
yeah  
how is it gonna be used what's the actual goal here it has to operate t. v. blah blah blah  
mm  
right  
but i i don't know that's just my opinion  
um i mean <unk> even if i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i think universal remote control should be possible  
mm 'kay  
i mean you could just provide with an optional  
okay  
yeah yeah yeah  
we have a slight problem  
yeah  
yes it's a stereo jack  
but uh twenty five euros  
you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t. v. and if you have whatever associated with t. v. the d. v. d. player  
um  
and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products both of these two  
um tool training  
yeah like i  
yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after sales i mean that would would be very good i mean those covers could go for for three  
okay  
so let me exit out of this first  
no  
i think the best is to go to work  
aren't they suing him  
and everything is blue except the power button  
that would be a very good idea  
so that's that's that was my reactions  
you've maybe got you know like if you're <unk> on ipod you've got five buttons and a wheel  
okay  
yeah  
you put the two then you you basically you say play on the both sides and you look whether at the end you have uh a recorded signals which is is is uh the time that it should uh be and uh or whether i mean the fact that whenever i mean the slides is doing some uh processing uh it there is some and there is some frame drops or things like this  
you can look for it later yeah  
i think if the line's too long  
i am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in  
yeah  
we don't have all the options  
i've  
is a just a background uh thing  
mm-hmm  
okay sorry  
well  
in fact on a flat place  
yeah  
and zero  
technology  
and that's a sort of basic r. f. kind of frequency so it'll be cheap  
a voice recognition can be uh implemented  
bit of a wide open question there of course  
well not here  
yeah totally  
um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control  
so you most of the time if you if you swap it  
okay so we've got uh  
yeah  
hmm  
it'd be like the ultimate remote  
yeah  
so we uh we do want latex  
because uh it seems that this can be yeah wood into plastic and it it should be fine  
i have two designs one including uh an l. c. d. screen <unk> which is basically the deluxe edition  
who would like wanna go first  
is the new trend  
yeah  
i think it's a good idea  
no you just tap i think  
maybe if we just leave the d. v. d. functional <unk> uh well i was thinking about putting it in  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
ah okay yes the kayak <unk> i was not even with the other one okay  
it's a a price matter  
so i will start just with the <unk>  
at least uh say this to us and we'll see uh with franck  
uh you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control  
'kay the <unk> if we're gonna have <unk> they require a simple chip but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and an l. c. d. requires advanced  
are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch  
so my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have  
<unk>  
okay  
uh i guess i start with my presentation  
<unk>  
i think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it you know  
um i can't remember who's got it  
oh the base yeah  
and really it all comes down to the to the user because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design  
yeah  
so maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one  
so it maps it into gaussian in that  
out  
wales  
mm-hmm mm yeah  
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> i i totally agree  
it <unk>  
what are we uh  
so people have to move their hand  
yes  
we need to we probably would have to have that colour and and logo decided upon  
i mean everything speaks for itself i guess  
we can have have a whole menagerie  
alright  
yes  
okay  
same remote with some  
ah okay  
mm  
so  
no no we have <unk> we have to change the end cost  
try and sell it <unk> sell it to them to supply with  
but they share some common properties that people will notice  
i wondered why yours always looked so more complicated  
um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it  
sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end and you say one for this  
and and here uh on the contrary for example the few words that are mm how may i say it recognized more can really make the difference  
because uh this just an on an audio video channel  
mm  
uh <unk> oh  
uh grouped buttons you know  
so that's eight kilo band width  
so  
mm-hmm  
i think so  
yeah what can we reduce  
oh but with special colour we have  
<unk> or like um  
we didn't have a t. v. last year and everyone thought we were off our heads you know  
no but <unk>  
you will had <unk> some more information in i think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um <unk> presentation  
yeah  
no  
uh until the ten also this middle part and on the left one is exactly the same  
oh  
something that displays the utterance where the where the word was like displays in a highlighted form where it was found  
okay it's line width but it's <unk> it's still where it says lines  
and that is my presentation  
i like the scroll the scroll action and the  
first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec technical functions working design  
but how do we make a selection if we <unk> cannot push the button  
i think that's that's a different problem  
do a lot of um  
okay brilliant  
uh probably just tuning in the channels would it be  
yeah  
i think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote 'cause most remotes have small square buttons  
there are plastic or rubber  
no why is th this is gonna be so bad  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
um  
ah okay i was actually i was planning the same but we won't get so much done before three that's the thing  
yeah  
no  
yeah you'll have to i would suggest creating a <unk> folder um called files to be checked or something like that  
like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah  
uh that's easy because plastic is free  
the the product or the project  
the chips made of silicon i guess  
uh the shapes are curved and round like uh you also said  
my name is and uh i hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes as will i  
in fact r. s. t. doesn't give you anything like that  
yeah  
yeah  
i will write  
but you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy  
i mean  
sure  
from that <unk> cohen's  
yes i i th that's what i mean so i mean something  
and uh well this obvious and he also said it  
okay  
the the fact that is lighted or not things like that and what would be convenient for the user  
i think i've just knocked the microphone  
yeah we came up with quite a bit  
yeah yeah  
uh pal and n. t. s. c. compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range  
that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text  
okay  
but i'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have  
you can uh uh display <unk> uh two presentations if you want to  
yeah  
mm  
yeah if uh if it's based on the uh um dialogue acts yeah  
yeah in fact if someone could create a file with the speaker i. d. <unk> and speaker names  
but in fact if <unk> you speak of uh a lot of things that are not expensive at the end you have uh something that is  
yes  
okay  
i think so  
mm  
we're we um  
mm  
yeah  
i think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea  
oh got it  
so  
and it costs too much to fabricate so we're on a tight budget here  
alright  
yeah but the the mic should not  
so you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition  
bob okay  
but you know because she's a non native english speaker i don't i don't know  
it's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no v. c. r. or that kind of uh so that's very easy  
and that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material  
oh thank you  
so  
and just like you say find me similar segments and then sort of like you have a list and you click on one of them and then you go to that segment  
uh first of all i'll start with the costs because that's going to influence our design  
keeping the <unk> uh fix to frame size because you're <unk> your this uh segment many times  
at which you need something to happen  
large accessible buttons for the essentials  
ah  
for l. c. d.  
i would go for a one on that at this point in time  
yeah  
yes so can  
i think it's something about the oh okay  
so uh when you ask people what do they use  
think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy  
um let's see where did i let's skip that  
if you make it uh in a rectangle  
uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables like people uh now  
so i mean i'm taking this to mean you know <unk>  
i will put it back on the on the nice green  
yeah  
oh brilliant then  
mm-hmm  
yeah i guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share  
um you know so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah  
the the room uh  
so there are not extra options in this case but uh  
we didn't make any uh  
so <unk> yeah  
a lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use complex  
so  
great  
i was just thinking if we were to store this information some type of mapping  
so that shouldn't be a problem  
okay  
mute  
i would've said yes  
yep same same pieces  
you know that we're losing gaze because of jiggle outside this closely defined region when it's in the middle of space then  
we're losing time but  
oh  
and what percentage of time over some you know reasonable time span of a couple of seconds alright  
uh no  
yeah  
that way you can separate where where is the the voice loud with uh or the loudest  
yeah  
yeah touch pads yeah  
yeah  
i think i <unk> i i could write the criteria in the on the <unk>  
ah  
yep  
uh  
oh okay  
and i dunno  
there you go  
that's it  
great thanks for that sarah  
mm um  
look and feel is <unk> it's true  
i'm i've got a a real reaction uh remote control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or or whatever  
mm yeah  
exactly but  
do we get another email  
they're just buttons  
okay  
yeah yeah  
it's uh i yeah it's classified work typically  
that we're gonna group our audio visual and other functions into into those categories um  
um  
no no  
what how much more expensive  
i cannot  
okay just make a separate remote for each uh  
okay  
the the results are the feel of the material is expected to be <unk>  
get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control  
ah  
yeah yeah  
it looks cool but it's really not it's not functional um  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and i will work it out  
yeah  
where you just move them  
no no  
but do i have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also  
yeah but  
yeah  
well let's let's see  
colour size <unk>  
yeah  
it just doesn't work  
yeah  
is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers  
um on thursday i managed to managed to get in and just just check the stuff and make sure it was all make sure th make sure ma make sure i could access it  
yeah  
well  
and had they asked we could have done it fine at a. t. c. and saved me having to to go to germany for a day  
um so now i <unk> have a different  
yeah  
um uh and at the end uh i uh when i finish it off i have some uh input from uh a master class i uh visited  
like that's a <unk> shape of a fruit  
you can call me <unk> or peter if you like  
it's um english uh yeah  
just the basics  
<unk> good morning  
it's supposed to be in brussels anyways  
i've done that too  
you changed the uh scroll wheel and  
um you can use the eraser to  
yeah  
but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way  
but does that equal innovative  
it should be  
yeah yeah to submit yeah  
if yeah if if you can pass me like the dialogue act with  
okay  
thanks  
because then we have a  
space age remote  
um yeah i i have uh said is not because uh a low number is better  
needs column densities which is a derived property  
the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume  
uh i thought about words  
um  
okay okay okay  
uh something for uh <unk> here  
we hope so  
okay  
i think  
yeah yeah  
it's a double r.  
'cause at that point then you've got the details up there  
so that's a limitation  
okay  
or make it on a hand dynamo but i don't think that will work  
so you say page rank of z. is equal to uh one over a constant to <unk> it  
yeah  
so that's fairly uh fairly good i think  
maybe put something on top of it or you know like that's looks funny  
yeah and and a <unk> basically they are just on the i. d. probably with a start time or something  
that'll also tell you where to chop the video to get it to line up  
well did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition  
you flip it open and yeah  
mm-hmm  
you should close it on your own notebook i guess  
doing uh anything with the voice you know  
okay  
'cause i i know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it  
um so there's not uh there's no longer a separate thing for creating new parts  
i'm not gonna buy a <unk> seventy five euro remote  
european standard yeah hynek really <unk> yeah even it's <unk> kind of aurora framework  
excellent  
um  
uh it's by pressing on blank  
he first he does the l. p. analysis and then he computes the residual  
i think this is a good advantage  
aye that's a good idea yeah  
mm-hmm  
so um we will be able to edit some uh interaction rules and the <unk> uh grammar  
so it would fit just nicely in the hand  
okay  
yep  
there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons lots of colours very confusing you don't know what you're doing  
you know the core which we don't remember anymore programming  
and that's it  
uh-huh  
well we have to choose one  
yeah  
oh yeah  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
but uh that's something but it's true yeah we could also try to put a visitor and the professor  
well i think we need to um like you mentioned earlier um factor in what this might be used for in the end  
'cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine good morning jo  
yeah  
yep  
um okay if we can move on to next presentation then please  
so then  
no that th i want the minutes from the previous minutes  
i i think it's it's  
before that happens the person who speaks is going to do some kind of visual scanning  
what uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others  
pretty much  
so like creating one file for the whole series that gives the <unk> the ideas from top to bottom and  
so i don't see that  
making you know getting rid of our weak points  
um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there but it could um tie in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea  
so  
but then i <unk> but then i wouldn't put an asterisk on it  
and that's without any special button supplements  
mm-hmm  
right i don't know if i can find that but  
mm-hmm  
yeah see that's 'cause that's the thing like that would rely on i just don't think it's a good idea to run the speech tools in  
okay  
okay  
yep that should be in  
what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta ta ta ta ta  
we didn't i think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time  
okay  
i i i i understand  
yeah  
ah it's okay  
uh-huh  
yeah yeah yeah  
so are you suddenly gonna be  
yeah but i mean <unk> you have to  
i agree yeah  
actually fifty hundred megabyte is quite big in ram  
i don't know that yet  
yeah  
there's a good idea  
mm-hmm  
ye yeah  
<unk> oh yeah  
yeah very much  
oh yeah like how the buttons  
mm  
'cause that's one i just didn't know what it  
wood  
okay  
okay  
production  
yeah  
we have been provided with uh some uh <unk> technical tools to uh  
they are really bad my drawing skills  
okay  
oh okay  
mm 'kay  
it's just irritating  
just the way people typically do this is you know  
yes it's <unk>  
bit of feedback  
also yeah  
you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something they're just not great to use  
you just like create a new x. m. l. document in memory  
yeah but it's  
i like that  
very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm  
yeah  
yeah  
can't make it entirely  
um remote control works as follows  
mm-hmm  
it kinda makes you think sort of organic touchy feely kiddie it's more like yeah  
yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb  
we we still pick up a signal  
yeah  
one  
but it not really going very convenient  
okay what is your email  
i missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh hey <unk> uh  
oh my bad um sorry  
mm  
no not too small yeah  
yeah of course  
yeah or so  
if you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector  
okay  
are there any more  
alright  
okay  
um button  
um  
um  
yeah an  
uh-huh  
anyways um today three presentations from every one of you  
mm  
okay  
i think yeah i don't know why but i think that is that's <unk> trendy too because that's the mo it it you know  
he  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah okay  
and there other other things which i'm doing  
um and it had some implications um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons  
twelve fifty  
so <unk> how we actually went round uh about doing it  
yeah  
fruits  
um did we want to go for the glow in the dark look  
and we could even you know market two versions  
now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on i think we might have to drop the voice rec  
i guess we should end this since we're off off topic  
i suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it  
i don't know the name of the university  
mm-hmm  
you can just slide up and down  
it's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me  
i  
we <unk> it seems that we no want to have a t. v. remote control  
ah okay  
so  
yeah  
but maybe i mean they have to they have to have some colour right  
there are disadvantages you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture  
mm-hmm  
not too many cables and stuff  
yeah  
let's have a look  
yeah me too  
that's that's interesting of course but that's of course a weak point yeah  
oh yeah  
um  
yeah  
and then in terms of <unk> material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle  
who doesn't  
yeah  
for all of us i think  
yeah like a like telephone charger or something  
um and so um it is important that these relations have a semantics that's tied to the semantics of the utterances right  
where it comes from  
and following the trends  
um but of course unfortunately all these things take time  
i think it's a process too i think  
oh five minutes  
so we are expecting to uh the system to perform better and more robust to noisy cases  
okay  
single sounds good 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double  
if  
well  
that's another thing  
well we we need to describe uh decisions now  
we'll give them the give them the l. c. d. we give what the customer uh wants right  
oh  
that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two  
how about uh you have any time on friday  
yeah that's a good point  
which voice you want to use  
mm  
just uh for my uh reading of the uh i. i. s. one o. eight uh four meeting series  
yeah  
like <unk> <unk> from which utterance which utterance it goes and stuff  
uh it fits within the current market trends  
so and if finally the t. v. breaks you get a new one you're gonna have to be able to tune it  
mm  
yeah  
in the entire mankind  
mono stereo pitch  
ah okay  
i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board i think that that's done for us  
um okay  
um i suggest we use the the sensor sample  
mm 'kay  
that would be  
i don't know where exactly but  
we'll find we'll find plenty of really really crucial <unk> things for you to do  
oh yeah right  
i love it  
but then you can create on more spared place in that big three piece room no  
<unk> yeah  
and then the sender which um  
and say this is the best this works slightly worse than this one  
it's also a complicated one  
copyright yeah  
okay  
that's quite big  
mm okay seems to be interesting mm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
you just sit in your chair  
so uh i think if you put this in the palm of your hand you'll see what a nice thing we have going here  
yeah  
not prominently flagged  
um okay you need some power source  
then we meet uh the new requirements  
and or if you wanna read something for a longer period of time in a more comfortable environment  
what other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote just some uh yeah  
so anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no  
maybe um  
yeah right  
so who want to start  
and that could be something could um separate us a bit  
yeah  
and um evaluate the product as a group  
right on  
uh i'm i have to look it up  
when you use it on the television you've you need the television <unk> which can use it  
cool  
um  
oh  
yeah so  
power source over here  
and a few occurrences of words that are there in terms of recognition make one two percent  
this time you have it  
hmm  
x. ray <unk>  
yeah yeah  
you can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it  
it's it's wide  
yeah  
<unk> the idea of uh a remote control  
so the phase the time between uh audio signals for um for this microphone on this <unk>  
i know i've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back 'cause it had so many buttons on  
uh do we find it good looking  
okay <unk> i sorry i used the wrong word what do you associate with the mate the material that material  
right  
i di  
th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have  
not every not a hundred percent of everything we produce but  
so so you're so what you are saying is that you you noticed that when you um tried other features and uh  
it i it wasn't too much  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
thank you  
indeed  
mm  
uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that  
now i don't know you don't want to use ah it's almost okay  
we could make it titanium instead of rubber  
bottom  
it's really a dissolve or is it really like is you have the feeling that it's both  
uh  
wow  
right  
um and one other suggestions i'd make is to in is to include in a menu system a bit like on the ipod  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
let's say that we can do something like that  
mm  
um i i was looking at the the complexity sort of uh aspect of the <unk> in that uh booklet  
because whenever you have microphones that you have to move it's it's it becomes complete uh really  
and it <unk> it  
and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept  
okay  
yeah  
i'll try and find out  
yeah until about four fifteen  
high power usage  
uh-huh  
okay  
everybody  
come on  
so  
um  
this you know very <unk> colours you know  
yeah yeah  
basis  
yes yes  
yeah  
we could've  
not not from what colin is doing from what i no  
you can uh put some uh which button is what  
okay  
so uh mm i'm thin uh i think uh i i'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we <unk> we can use  
yes  
right  
we got these buttons here  
i i  
cheap remote control  
yeah yeah i <unk> it sounds like you you <unk> don't wanna <unk> things  
i was really i am very satisfying to work with  
yeah yeah if you're around them for a long period of time  
yeah  
i still don't have my scroll wheel though  
yeah  
you mean the top of the wave form  
and i've indicated in a column whether something is priority  
bye  
so what <unk> do you suggest for that  
oh no no no this is a single this this is a model with just the t. v. one  
um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition what what do the current ones sell for  
but if it had been there um you would've  
well we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it  
alright  
so please look at it  
or that's uh that's for us  
um so before we do that can i just ask you a question about <unk>  
ma <unk> you just can't do that or uh  
yep  
hmm  
yeah okay  
six so it's uh five point five or less  
well it's maybe related to the u. i.  
yeah that was what uh  
so  
no mouse yeah  
i was on <unk> i was on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> committee  
a long time  
it would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable  
exactly  
and i actually uh think that that's a slightly extreme um position um with regard to the literature that a lot of people might say it doesn't really matter who the different speakers are in an interactive section  
it's it's not really gonna  
yeah  
yeah  
something like that  
six  
that can be <unk>  
yeah  
mm  
that should be separate  
um  
uh the screen and the brightness  
mm-hmm  
better better <unk> implement than we had before  
okay  
we have to make be clear what that is  
because i  
right  
ah  
well i don't know if this information is available from teletext also  
a and also <unk> in 'cause in the meetings uh the speakers might might report something uh they've done in the past and uh uh uh uh talk about th what they are currently doing and also planning some future actions  
yeah it doesn't matter that much  
<unk> left left  
yeah  
polished  
i'm not sure if that counts but  
we are going for twenty five euros sales price but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it  
oh  
hmm  
uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty and now we have current customers uh of forty plus  
well <unk> ho  
<unk>  
yeah  
i don't think so because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions  
well originally i was assuming we had the red apple and therefore that was the special colour  
yeah  
uh let's see  
yeah that's your role  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no but we're going to th make this <unk> for a all kind of people so it it it has to be  
systems  
components  
i think for gaming you know you want you want some big buttons for up down left and right shoot  
yes  
we're already at eleven  
there are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries  
thing  
i know i i like to have things written down in front of me actually  
hmm  
single  
um as for the energy source um you know almost every remote control uses just batteries but we don't have to be limited by that  
mm-hmm  
volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course  
alright  
beer  
i mean uh <unk> are you is it okay if we talk about this for a minute 'cause i'm confused  
that's right  
two and three or one and two  
what what did you say  
yeah  
pine apple  
yeah  
so you wanna click on it activate it <unk> and when you move it hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound  
but that's easily to do with the colour i think  
i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top  
yeah yeah  
no  
yeah that's right that should be an option  
personally i would prefer round ones  
i i would if i had my perfect remote control i'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way  
mm-hmm  
well  
they can handle that remote control but but it isn't <unk>  
and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the <unk> actual owner of the the t. v. and who would normally use the unit  
mm <unk> no  
and it it's uh it's too long it's too long  
you you do wouldn't you need several documents for each category  
th yeah the search is i guess the search is sort of a strange beast anyway because for the search we're leaving the nite x. m. l. framework  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh power  
mm-hmm  
fifty percent of the users lose their remote often  
'kay  
is the design what we wanted it to do  
yeah  
no  
do we have uh yeah  
hmm  
the  
so  
there is an extra little symbol in here and that was just kinda carelessness  
yeah  
because as far as i understand this work on the phoneme anyway still takes some development time in the sense that uh no  
'kay  
um one thing with the scroll buttons though  
yeah  
uh  
and it's also i indeed uh uh <unk> uh insight in the in the topic  
alright good so how many actions do we need to implement in it  
um there are two types of user interfaces  
so it's very uh when you uh when you use it doesn't uh become irritating to see  
i wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that but <unk> you go for it  
they could discuss deciding to break something and and then one guy does it  
but that worked well having having a <unk> that we could draw on as well as having the <unk>  
yeah are we gonna have time to make it display like a whole archive of meetings  
right  
ah as  
so i think if it's so then it's cool  
hmm  
like how often do you hit nine  
um we've worked out what it would be anyway  
so the colour the colour can do it  
yes these are from from another uh manufacturer  
marketing i'm not sure what you what you came up with yet  
and uh some way there are parameters that can be measured that tell you that following certain uh criteria uh there is one very easy for example  
yep  
um because because essentially you're looking at um cycling sequences in discourse  
yeah yeah yeah i mean yeah  
single simple chip on print  
one  
yeah or but also like all these elements like like the loading and yeah integration and and like handling the data loading and stuff  
we've got the bank of people  
<unk> on a scale of one to seven how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost  
well if it could be done we  
and the old people old and boring  
so that's uh the first thing we i think we should pay less attention to uh teletext  
health safety data protection  
it started because i wanted to have it as <unk> as a stem and then alright so  
okay  
but it's the language part that's the hard part  
okay  
okay  
yeah and the button then  
mm  
right sure  
it will be a small value  
and it's easy to find so i don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating  
yeah for for for given an an example yeah  
we would have to do i mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too <unk> overly optimistic  
you <unk> you you thing  
nu  
mm-hmm  
and that's uh really global  
as a principle  
to <unk>  
okay  
uh yeah i guess that's let's see what is that  
as you can see this uh there there are uh two uh weird bumps in it  
i remember trying to load a d. v. d. player recently  
and also like the and the fancy designs yeah  
of the link  
and apparently nokia's in a bit of trouble over that one but yeah  
yeah  
so uh that's not i hope that's not too much  
three  
um i guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically  
uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap actually  
and there is a like i would say three  
uh sure  
yeah  
that  
um the various inputs  
um no  
you've got no way of getting in and extracting just that word  
something that stands out  
ah yes  
mm <unk> please  
uh dialogue <unk>  
but the person who is really perhaps active in <unk>  
but it's a one uh maybe uh  
point that we making about losing it  
if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah  
yeah  
i think one of the things that we can put right on the box is never buy another battery  
i can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated  
yeah that's one yeah <unk> uh th oh  
the mute button  
hmm  
mm right  
intuitive completely intuitive  
mm-hmm  
well this is clay  
yeah  
they're he's we're talking about just adding attributes to these things that say the number of <unk> that counted as that looking at triangle one right  
okay  
so we're going to erase features or something  
if if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics  
yeah  
sixty milliseconds  
okay  
yes uh-huh yeah  
or no  
um okay how about if i uh pass this back to you and i'll uh figure out the average here  
oh let's see there was a <unk>  
yeah but that that's the same with the solar cell  
oh  
yeah uh 'cause it really isn't worth it  
mm mm mm mm mm  
but you could <unk> you can um achieve the same effect  
people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from  
yeah  
yes that also sounds uh pretty uh neat  
mm  
mm-hmm  
and then the corporate identity  
yeah  
so that's uh that's a big <unk> so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh  
you know to hold it to signal to the user and push a button maybe to start <unk> talking about it  
yeah  
as soon as you press a button it it mm uh give gives you feedback one five or whatever  
i don't know how long it takes me  
and you will look into the technical design and um form i think  
mm  
you can model it better  
yeah but not too soft we have decided  
uh well <unk> th there are certain companies um that i don't wanna name who don't always get it right  
or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology just you can write in the way you normally write  
um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics  
how far away is your television  
kinetic is uh <unk> makes it more expensive  
and yeah with real media  
something that looks <unk> you know  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so it's a jiggle rate okay  
whether it's what goes into the box somehow  
um  
but this is not i don't want to mess you up with that it's not the same kind of experiment  
small also  
a webbed foot  
i went to uh paris and milan for some trend watching  
okay you don't set it yourself it just remembers the channel that you are on most for example  
maybe version uh three point o. uh has other colours  
does anybody know  
ah i can't cut and paste it into the other folder but  
three  
yeah  
finish meeting now  
well <unk> that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated  
two two  
because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control  
mm  
maybe we can have uh  
maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside  
i do but the whole project is you know focussed on ami hub data as their first priority  
logo or something or motto i can't remember exactly what you said  
yeah  
yeah and it might be too expensive  
is it three months i think  
oh another one  
because which buttons do we have now  
in four diff in in four meetings  
um  
oh okay  
well yeah  
sure  
mm  
mm-hmm  
no much <unk>  
uh yes th thank you  
yeah  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
maybe what i say i'm very tired  
well  
the image of it  
scroll wheels uh those can be pushed as well although that is more expensive  
i think you can transform the wood into plastic maybe  
so um one of the things i i was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it <unk> we probably need a <unk> it needs to be a universal remote control probably  
otherwise the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button  
mm  
yeah well tell me about some of the constraints and well first of all i must say that there are also quite a lot of common points  
no  
mm-hmm  
fairly separate functions  
just the lights behind the buttons  
okay um before that i i have some some some thing uh to say before um  
is it really fancy  
hmm  
with the extra controls  
well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude the one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications  
but you can here that there are many artifacts which right exactly  
mm-hmm  
does anyone want to like just sit with me and like play for three hours with nite x. m. l. at some point  
i i <unk> prefer rubber because it feels uh yeah  
yeah it's not g. s. m.  
thirty minutes the  
yeah  
mm  
um  
if there is uh two two person the same sector i see  
so i can draw but uh  
i <unk> i uh <unk> i was just thinking about it  
hey what what what's the company colour  
sure  
okay  
so  
'kay  
no we'll apply them then for now  
um sorry  
or using the names and the keyboard i dunno  
no they do they do  
the most  
yeah the quality is that's why i was asking that  
to merge the two system huh  
are they  
uh we use bat  
but you also have the titanium  
and that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost that they know that  
oh  
hmm  
but that's a relatively good measure of whether that's a very specific word  
we're going back and now uh our industrial designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal  
but it doesn't uh the  
um  
'cause i'm sure that could be <unk> inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh we know the problem of that that uh this is that after each meeting somebody has to take care about the d. v. tapes and to <unk> convert them into <unk>  
'kay  
mm mm mm  
um but therefore no rubber will be used  
and all the other remote controls are high tech in buttons and uh and so on  
only marginally better than the old one  
well that were my ideas a little bit  
uh well <unk> first off let's start start with the energy  
so shape plus colour  
expensive  
i yeah i think it  
<unk> not very practical  
no not really  
i didn't really receive yeah  
we can discuss  
you steph to do the user interface and for you the trend watching  
um so we've already addressed that and i think that would actually be worse for something like r. s. i. i mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing  
yeah but <unk> that that only is one  
hmm  
rolls away yeah  
we'll <unk> i'll use the <unk> i guess  
so but this so two things i still don't understand  
um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end though we should never avoid functionality of course  
the task what what he came back and said that at the end  
okay we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um excuse <unk> i've just deleted that whole thing  
yeah if  
yeah but a wood we can make it brown dark brown not wood  
uh but it's a good trade off for them if they can have their logo on it  
so raid five you have told to the  
and you're hoping that it it so what you're saying is that i have two <unk> of marbles for my two models  
i'm the user um  
yeah  
i thought it <unk> might be let's make things better or something but  
i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget and that we had to cut a lot of stuff  
and there are so many new systems and everything is new but it baseline is still uh <unk> twenty years old and  
three  
uh i mean that's just um  
yeah i make it <unk> colour  
but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer  
i i <unk>  
oh because you would say that she's an assistant professor or something like that  
yeah i have some ideas  
uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah uh uh  
correct  
yeah  
the second is a bit  
so if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control  
but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone or like a little cradle for your ipod  
apart from just the look of it  
step into the future of of remote controlling your t. v.  
um  
yeah of course of course  
or not much originality really  
what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do  
bottom  
okay  
uh  
yeah  
so um with the model builder what do you need to do with it  
so <unk> is the uh the industrial  
dark uh letters yeah  
mm  
um so are we agreed then of those things  
so  
i think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new <unk> new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety <unk> ninety five percent of young people was  
uh  
uh well uh the the real reason is um as long as they've been blinking  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and it and we'll just see whatever you whatever you supply us we'll try to tie in and <unk> in some way or another  
this would be uh  
yeah okay  
yeah  
except you don't know your way around  
i guess this would be  
but i mean it could be as many nodes as you want  
okay so the available things are l. c. d. the buttons and everything  
yeah  
yeah  
something uh we'll have to come up with a name patent it  
we gotta do that on the right the most right most screen because the <unk>  
mm yeah i've seen them  
but not everything is uh um simple linear  
alright  
no  
sorry  
so i i so  
okay  
yeah  
but that's just <unk> i mean just based on the ones that i've been to  
i think of it's got lots of extra sort of <unk> and you know like  
yeah  
yeah  
for menu  
but i'm not sure that it's quite what you want um  
yes  
well it's it's about one point five  
mm-hmm  
yeah nothing more  
mm-hmm  
yeah i think it's in a different  
yeah  
i mean because this we actually don't know  
because the data like will be released very soon  
hmm  
oh okay cool  
we say something about objects and i think it's that we don't use it  
maybe you can make uh uh mm okay  
and that'll maybe have five links and a picture on it and then because it links to page two and page three  
ah  
um it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but another thing is that um  
th thank you then  
so it's don't make it too stable uh  
that's to be uh a formed for your hand  
oh  
the methods i i prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a <unk> on more  
you you could always find out how many words there are in an utterance couldn't you  
i thought so  
r. three c.  
one and the l. c. display  
so if this isn't to scale what kind of  
okay  
you can use the l. c. d. in a good way  
yeah  
that's enough to get started with so  
it won't stand  
so to <unk> the i may be imagining it  
ah once you have an extra menu button you don't need that that extra option  
make it plastic instead of rubber  
uh possibly  
mm-hmm  
so so i suppose pose that that way the  
hmm  
yeah  
what are we going to do now  
yes  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
um the next part they want is the user interface concept  
let's see that you what would be handy  
the they're they're due uh i i was told the beginning of this week  
it's it's uh very hot at the moment so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing or did i said management  
so you have your l. c. d. screen right here suppose  
so one speaker will have the floor channel um throughout that and so i guess what you're saying is that the interactive sections would have shorter speaker turns when you're not considering the back channels as interruptions  
okay  
you know  
so  
yeah  
we have a budget of twelve fifty per product  
couldn't we do that all through one button something a menu button that pops up with a menu on the t. v. that says  
yeah but since we want to control all the televisions  
why do i pay you for  
yeah might be interesting stuff coming in  
where with more technical specifications  
you can even  
we should possibly have  
okay  
that's  
well we do a <unk> filtering of sort of the whole thing  
yeah  
will be down or okay  
most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop  
um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other  
mm  
yeah  
uh so contrast  
hmm  
if if we want to keep the reading room  
i can think about whether g. d. f. <unk> got everything we need in it  
we just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and  
yeah  
maybe a three this time  
designer  
<unk>  
there's another point i want to make  
sorry  
so  
no m.  
uh-huh  
so  
mm  
but i think based on my <unk> studies i th i feel that users are <unk> the look and the feel and the <unk> above  
yeah  
so maybe tracking devices is a good idea  
red  
yeah  
um a few  
that is true that is true  
l. e. d.  
something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control  
but still still you can you can five times more compute  
let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting  
well i ma i ma i may be maybe i want to check out these batteries and things won't i  
yeah  
hmm  
to make it user friendly  
so um  
no no  
so  
i'm sorry  
yeah well  
and it should be a user friendly clear buttons and not too much  
yeah yeah  
so if we have this table uh that is <unk> accessible to students if they arrive if we provide a feedback of um who is talking  
not  
well do we'll do it on the prototype so do two see how much it is  
because if your if your <unk> lost it's probably under the <unk> and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it  
like um to give feedback  
but c. files yeah  
uh-huh  
yes  
well we wanna small <unk> remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed  
so i think we're yeah on well the reaction of my group was that this was almost full already so i well we tried to  
but this is <unk> <unk> no  
so  
so  
uh p. l. p. they're also last  
banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then  
they need account on these machines so that they could book  
it has to be  
that is pretty stupid  
okay  
we went straight into finance  
i think it does  
we need to lose some buttons  
yeah  
so i think b. s. c. w. is the right way to exchange these  
it's important  
maybe like this pen  
such a long time since i've done these  
yeah  
it just <unk> doesn't make any sense i think is the thing with wood  
prototype yeah  
the power channel and volume buttons are easy accessible  
spicy  
mm  
next slide  
okay  
so then for the scroll are we going for the ipod type  
okay  
so you can say channel twenty or channel four because you really want to go on this channel  
um mm mm  
hmm yeah  
we have uh four distinctive remote controls for that  
it's a tricky one  
shall i swap those around  
yeah  
yeah  
but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had  
no i think there is sprinkler or something around here i hope so  
hmm  
how do you wear this thing  
um  
'kay and that's it for the moment  
yeah  
let's go for one  
a two  
yeah  
yeah  
so a <unk> a small example  
well i feel comfortable now  
but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty  
no i think working from the bottom up sounds great  
yep  
so <unk> hang on  
it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically  
so we're just going for power channels volume  
okay  
thing that doesn't have that much functionality  
hmm  
ah  
mm-hmm  
true  
so  
no  
sorry uh <unk>  
mm  
and that's really irritating  
okay  
we need to keep it simple have limited buttons which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for  
mm-hmm  
okay so while this is warming up there it is uh  
so i mean i don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element  
so i don't think that's super important  
huh  
well th  
i mean it you know later on we can fix it if it if it turns out those parts it's not urgent now  
uh roughly i don't don't don't wanna have and it's not a deadlines <unk>  
yeah  
i think all the special colour things have to be marked over here because that's what we were planning to do making it  
so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control  
so it uh we could not consider that  
you ping  
it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone  
yeah why not  
well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote  
that'll basically take us down to the budget  
this is the teletext  
um  
you can uh um there's a document folder called um the <unk> shared document folder  
so i mean i don't think it should take a lot of time i mean just to look at this right  
no but uh  
um  
and uh the docking <unk> uh i think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself  
and what would be the matter here of the first layer i mean  
next  
mm-hmm  
so yeah  
okay next question  
so in the <unk> user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want  
and are they any special form  
okay  
so june june june two thousand six  
yes  
hang on  
well it's okay  
or a good watch  
mm  
th that's a bit of that's a problem  
it could be a turtle or a snail and  
really  
okay  
then one by one  
that is true  
maybe we think it takes one week and then it takes one month  
yeah  
'cause that's the main thing people will <unk> wanna do  
yeah  
yeah where there's extra parts  
yeah that's okay  
we <unk> we can learn  
that's not cool  
yeah yeah that that'd be one way of doing it yeah  
um  
and by the time they found the remote control the program is finished  
so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs you can programme in <unk>  
basically he's a he's at stanford the guy  
currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition  
i think it should probably be done off line  
so north park actually if you want to get real specific  
so we have the three birds we have the design that we have the the fancy bit  
and in that case we use um a frame grabber here  
so um <unk> yeah we had like five slides <unk> uh presenting different systems  
we didn't keep that in um well if we i know it would make it a little less <unk> a little more confusing  
well see you uh <unk> <unk> we have lunchtime by the way now uh so uh  
okay  
thing to do  
so this one model and uh yeah  
hmm  
no but that's 'cause i think yours is in the <unk> mail separate like it's not on the server  
we had an arrow here or what  
uh-huh  
but nothing restricted for user interface  
of twelve fifty  
something like that  
true  
and i can imagine it's gonna take a wee while to i can imagine you know  
if anyone needs any more information  
yeah that's true because that blue one did look quite <unk>  
i have another idea i'm not sure if it's possible  
because the the <unk> the audio and vi the audio visual <unk> comes at a specific point in the eye track file  
which one is it  
but physically it's just uh something flat on the table again yeah  
yeah but you can  
mm  
ooh  
<unk> <unk> is is there anything you want to add  
yeah yeah yeah if click somewhere you'll see features  
okay cool  
well it's a process though isn't it  
criteria  
and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something  
okay  
so um  
the you know that 'cause i remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often  
so  
okay  
that's a good idea  
well uh i think the advantage eventually <unk> i mean the advantage with this kind of things is that are much easier  
no no no single curved is like this  
multi channel that's a word i made up i don't really know what it means  
alright  
single curved i'd say  
the <unk> uh we will sell the <unk> at twenty five euros  
they're going with the fashion thing like the design spongy rubber  
it's yeah it's uh <unk> video scene shot  
but like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just  
oh no  
uh <unk>  
that yeah  
or some kind of rubber around it  
right  
yeah  
well this is not this speech is not restricted only to papers and these things you know  
um but the hard part is knowing how you wanna do that  
uh you're welcome  
yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh  
but yeah they're sure to do that  
the whole thing  
um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want  
so why do we need to have two x. m. l. trees in memory at once  
okay don't forget to save it  
mm  
i think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up whereas on a piece of paper on a computer on a board  
redesign  
um and has a <unk> a high relevance of six point five  
okay  
yeah  
that whole yeah  
sorry  
so and anyway it it takes time this this computation  
okay and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time  
we have to go design the prototype  
because we're on the sixth floor you can actually see everything 'cause i don't think buildings are much higher than was it six or eight floors  
now we can forget this ever happened  
i think that's a  
so for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want  
uh it's just not it it's not affordable  
but i <unk> kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know i think i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project  
bastard  
forties okay because because younger people as  
yeah i it's <unk> for <unk>  
mm  
is your person to square meter ratio within the <unk> university norms  
but at the same time are simple  
um but it could have an l. c. d. screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons  
no but but  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but don't we wanna make the background the the bright <unk> colours  
i think it should <unk>  
'kay  
<unk> yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
what are what's everyone's numbers  
yeah  
yeah  
simple push button  
alright  
i'm not sure if i'm supposed to expect a confirmation for my confirmation from him now or but i'll just email him again and <unk> ask him if we can maybe make it one sorry  
you can make it wider and less wide  
we can use a simple a regular or advanced chip  
my <unk>  
but it it must not look too childish of course huh  
so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to  
or the volume yeah  
i didn't test it  
or are they just sort of taking out the words with the highest priority and then the words of the second highest priority  
so well you understand  
so  
take it away  
and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote  
yep  
stereo remote control users out there eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy  
this is yeah  
hmm  
uh that's that's a problem  
and then throw it  
i it just shows what sort of energy source  
you should also <unk> um have your the lapel mic on as well  
so i think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time  
you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach  
um i've done some investigation and uh well  
and uh yep  
ne no problem but if you see so many models and so many mixtures yeah  
um and yeah still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so  
because it's not in an ideal place right now  
try to listen to it carefully enough but not not so that you're obsessing over it for too long  
what happens if there's a figures coming on the slide  
so this <unk> this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls  
so  
oh yeah heidi  
so if you don't do overlap <unk> you will lose information at the beginning and the end  
they're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff  
so again it's pretty much similar to what i've said in the previous meeting  
yeah  
um 'cause i've gotta do the analysis for the <unk> on parts and things anyway  
mm-hmm  
that's nice argument but if it's it's still four our of twelve  
big and a long tail  
it's not  
yeah one  
mm-hmm  
because you know what i'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned are hot  
um or from zero to nine  
i so i think  
and then if the moment you use the scroll wheel the the the menu gets activated  
um power source i figured batteries 'cause they're easily available  
and then have to change all change everything at the last minute  
okay  
<unk>  
i should be getting new information i guess  
i i think so too  
hmm  
is that a worm  
yeah  
what did you get  
nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say b. b. c. four as your channel one  
real reaction yeah  
it it would be it would be nice to have a <unk> scheme though wouldn't it  
<unk>  
yeah  
um i don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that i think we need are channel control  
you know  
yeah yeah easy to use very afford  
<unk> so i think it's much more <unk> i think it would make more sense to go about this problem figuring out what kinds of relationships we want and then finding and  
me too  
get your own remote or digital cable  
yeah sure  
like if i where i've written e. r. for uh change it all to u. h. that sort of thing  
for <unk> yeah right  
okay  
okay  
you know this  
because our name is real reaction  
well that's that's just like that's a clay it's a prototype  
so they they they work on a lot of these standards  
or  
to <unk> to capture  
and we'll meet back at i'm not sure  
release your anger  
so it's <unk> yeah it it it it isn't entirely unclear but so i wouldn't give it a seven  
i wouldn't buy it personally  
oh that is fire will lose all the data you know  
it's very promising  
yeah <unk> uh <unk> well uh i meant uh by by battery i meant uh i will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh i didn't <unk> we didn't decide yet which kind of battery  
yeah  
to the in  
yeah  
okay  
are we  
um  
so  
good good comment  
alright  
or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse  
he got uh he's founding something more uh around three or three point five e. s. t. optimum threshold  
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this  
should uh  
that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours one a more conservative one one that's more fruity  
get the younger  
mm-hmm  
j. and j.  
um and that the function we agreed was volume power numbers enter channels a way to move between channels easy to use and hand held  
an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it  
okay  
and then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh <unk>  
it wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition  
what is it  
well  
yeah mm-hmm  
i dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that <unk> it all that we agree on uh <unk> like a marketing identity  
not at this point  
it's a <unk> a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it  
i mean i'm just thinking about um  
uh so the  
so it's gone  
but  
um  
no more time for problems  
i would go for the double curved  
yep  
so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote  
i think  
oh right  
so let's take that out  
it's in the other  
extra  
i mean this is this is the finishing  
okay  
and what we got was we found that if you uh what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market  
d.  
it's useful but not <unk>  
a minus here plus over here  
my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be <unk> uh  
ta nah  
bunny rabbit  
does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together  
but there there's there's joint events  
um you know to  
and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control  
yeah  
is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue  
so <unk> in fact <unk> we have to put two here  
okay  
look at the case the case the case of of uh of uh  
might need so  
<unk> we have six five  
and one  
well i would say skill uh i would say six or something  
mm 'kay  
yeah right  
oh  
mm-hmm  
that  
and we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing  
ugh  
so no more questions we can close the session  
yeah  
yeah  
um i've not used it to do that before but  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah a one hand uh solution  
but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics  
and i should imagine that most people would rather do a poster than give a talk  
so um i'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so <unk> what actually it's about what is the user going to do  
but that that's its power i guess because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains well uh really a lot of buttons  
okay  
they have seen enough of it  
sorry  
easier device like air conditioning or something  
but would it be useful to <unk> implement both  
mm-hmm that's cool  
right  
seven  
it's a happy face  
okay  
um similarly with the conceptual design we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together  
and you want <unk> to switch uh the channel or something well <unk> it might not work  
is it from thirty  
mm-hmm  
ah yeah  
mm-hmm  
and uh these were the findings which i i saw with the web web  
section  
some some kind of <unk> weight in it  
maybe three yeah  
no  
this is hard  
<unk>  
mm  
um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false  
okay  
yeah i think i find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end  
okay  
no no  
sorry i actually need  
next slide  
they were trying to model uh um <unk> of different components for g. m. m. instead of using a diagonal  
oh  
i hear you people are typing  
so yes one  
i honestly can't draw for toffee  
yeah  
mm  
'kay  
so what kind of solution as alexandre mentions i do we need to take somebody  
no i i see it  
we'll see  
yeah  
hmm  
also  
the process the project process  
five  
it doesn't matter how efficient your um encoding of the <unk> is you're always gonna have a high relatively high bit rate  
um  
we can look at the possibilities for an uh l. c. d. and uh i dunno  
yeah  
well first thing uh i was uh uh i got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents  
uh that should be fine  
yeah  
maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic  
yeah yeah  
now let's talk about uh interface  
clip aren't used much  
mm uh no  
so small stylish and something that's just a little different  
well yeah the <unk> integrated huh  
um you each have individual actions i. um i. d. industrial design you've your components concept user interface the user interface concept market trend wa watching  
maybe  
and then the television is on also or just the remote  
yeah  
and then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote  
and then did you get anything in <unk> in france  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
is on top  
but the question is i then it's you know  
people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons  
um  
yeah  
so damped lyman alpha absorbers shouldn't be in there  
it's mine  
that it would be too long to develop  
of the  
oh this is how much time you spend just getting the right software going  
on the scale <unk> it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at so  
it is  
but i <unk> i mean i thought we had basically the same ideas to <unk> i don't remember ever having strong arguments about what should be in what group or it was just the rules about things that <unk> yeah  
yep left right balance um maybe even <unk> programmed sound modes  
uh catchy colours  
yeah  
we'll look into this lock key  
but then i'm slow at <unk>  
yeah  
uh now the thing about doing a web crawl is the bigger your web crawl  
i mean how many people went out and bough a nokia phone back when we were like in high school  
that's that's <unk>  
so but but but you will be here and from different point of view eh  
okay  
i mean what do you want do you want but  
okay  
i like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that  
'cause it would have a docking base  
yeah  
yeah  
so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well <unk> teletext is outdated now  
it's almost impossible for like l. v. c. aside impossible to use it right  
but i presume that the functions must come up on the t. v. screen  
so in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people  
i don't know  
and even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be  
okay  
i think it's been fine  
how fast is yours vera  
yeah  
yep  
yes  
but i don't think we should mark high red shift in that  
what do you what do you all think  
colour  
oh  
and this one this is uh the card that we have already at <unk> for the <unk>  
so we could we could essentially well  
okay  
function f. eight yeah  
no signal  
uh-huh  
i think it's both  
yeah  
there are two kind of uh yeah they are very different indian and african elephants  
and uh so i think for them this is fine um after i yeah  
but look at your role your marketing role  
it's international so we have to use a standard  
no no  
no  
i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry  
didn't you  
no  
i couldn't be sure about it at the time  
and if you make the single curve ha just a big curve  
okay  
then this is the design  
meetings finish when they have to or even before  
okay  
so how it's gonna look  
mm-hmm  
that doesn't uh it says it's <unk> better for this task but it doesn't really say anything else  
so you don't think the <unk> is is really useful or  
if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need <unk> you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case  
yeah  
and what's your opinion  
yeah or a yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic <unk> uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border  
i could  
you mean the loo the look the outside  
yeah  
no um  
it's a stereo jack  
this we discussed just now  
no i'm saying uh when you take your signal you take one frame you apply the window uh and the window is simply uh coefficients you give  
you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore  
um and uh the uh uh the u. i. d. and the i. d. were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at  
band you mean  
because you know it's easier to manage and you know  
and you can get that information  
<unk>  
um that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous  
it's as a proposal  
okay the waiting is for our marketing expert <unk>  
no okay that uh that's true  
easy to use  
i think the creative genius should go first  
um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface  
so we make it a  
oh that's a bit of a problem  
okay um so i'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective  
well i think that i'm more now  
why would you put it uh then and where is the recording uh the microphone  
yeah  
ah sorry  
oh no the chip composer sender  
and i guess there is a difference between uh an a. g. n. with emission lines and one without <unk> especially if it's x. ray detected  
so that might play on what we can do  
'cause i hate working on dice  
hmm  
delete  
mm-hmm  
um and then i ran it on the first meeting getting um the so what's in the in the brackets in this window here is the utterances  
well uh  
my four points sorry forgotten that  
because otherwise we have to get different shapes and colour way easier than yeah the shapes  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
oh  
okay  
maybe possible someday  
have we had any just where it says line ratios  
yeah yeah  
if you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this  
so i th  
it's a nice chorus yeah  
are these designs  
it's a cat  
yeah the the girl said the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment  
at this precise time yeah  
yeah you'll understand why when we get to my <unk>  
so it's only the central part  
device so um  
but i think maybe for our budget do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the  
one of my presentations  
oh yeah we have to do the project uh evaluation  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
'cause we have the l. c. d. screen  
and then some internet research  
uh but we know that uh in this uh in this case we are not able to integrate <unk> information uh uh line <unk> information  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
a lot a lot of buttons buttons  
but i think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf  
no  
okay  
so depends on the l. c. d. and the scroll  
well uh then already come to my personal preferences  
yeah but you you can have some basic colours and then we come with the special patterns on them and and uh and uh  
yeah but i <unk> i don't think he means that it would be  
'kay  
it it's  
'kay we're done designing  
no uh  
um an l. c. d. screen though might be something that you know you can shift through pages kind of li the way this <unk> is working  
because we have some uh cost issues still to come  
go ahead  
i think once you've 'cause you have the channel features <unk> uh you have the uh screen features audio features  
i think any des  
so they <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
so yeah for the monologue i've i have not uh looked into the details about the this kind of uh relations for the monologue parts  
easily put us one step ahead of the current competition  
you can always add a few  
so we can forget <unk> and uh use uh input se the input reader for the the m. peg we can re lo use uh open c. v.  
yeah if we make it into a four as in neutral because we didn't implement it  
okay  
are some of the the the um  
like the standard standard deviation formula just requires you to have the mean initially  
because i mean i mean the i. v. c. system  
right okay  
like these standards again all these g. s. m. standards  
there is a closing sheet  
but i have no experience with that  
it doesn't it doesn't have to be  
yeah no no no  
sounds interesting  
and <unk> for some people yeah  
and i could data dot x. m. l. but in fact it's just a simple convention i <unk> could have put nothing but i just put data  
but then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in  
sorry  
so we'll give it a  
yes yes  
do they <unk> how much that costs  
yeah soft like a uh like a sponge  
at least that uh countries which have uh a television  
yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the <unk> if necessary um  
so maybe it does a better job of <unk>  
what colour were we gonna make it  
so  
um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles  
but as i said i mean uh with even the motion detector when it's black it's there is not <unk> no structure  
yeah  
and then after that you can um use some <unk> insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the t. v.  
uh  
we will have first to so mister money what's your opinion according to this remote control  
okay the <unk> the other issue is um uh i if we do a voice over uh does that affect the language that the people choose to use  
the criteria  
i have two with the  
you know if the people change their mind you change also the product  
yeah  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
and i think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups uh nice design which uh does not make the remote control in your room  
and i've put you guys on mondays at this time for my convenience but it's not like it's important that  
but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip then it'll even out i think  
guess not  
lefty <unk> righty <unk>  
so ma uh make it make it a two  
um you are here in a specific role  
if you mm  
we do the meeting  
yeah  
yeah on uh <unk> uh on the bottom of the remote you can do  
like you know just within the simple sense when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up <unk> usually the buttons light up  
oh right  
and  
mm-hmm  
yes <unk> yes  
i guess  
sorry  
oh  
yeah i mean if we just want to have um some data for the user face could even be random data  
but what it is it actually that numbers  
it's all subjective  
you can seven  
just draw a big black line on the borders i think  
you <unk> certainly could  
the sideways view uh that that that ma  
yeah  
uh there's the rubber on the right i think  
yeah  
but what i can show you now is a little programme if we want to be um very precise about so it's ma get frames  
mm-hmm  
by your humble p. m.  
yeah  
so we need a hip but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product  
yeah very clear  
well okay it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is  
yeah okay but so they could  
um  
mm yep  
yeah  
you can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button  
yeah  
easy to use  
oh  
um there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart  
yeah  
how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now  
he wants a small remote control or  
yeah mm-hmm  
in  
because it went a bit fast  
just they'll get few more  
oh that's the other side  
mm-hmm  
um as we said the <unk> probably used for comfort and anti r. s. i. and that's about it  
yeah  
the joystick  
this is not clearly defined yet  
i find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot just out of boredom like <unk> come on gimme something  
oh no no problem  
no  
an upside down v.  
it's not been seen before so it could be quite a a novelty factor attractive as well  
uh it's about it  
exactly  
but there are some built in like easy voices which you can <unk> uh there is a default one completely synthetic  
okay  
then re mapping the lowest remaining one to zero and scaling it like that 'cause you get a much nicer distribution like that  
and i was working and working and work okay well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied but it it could've been uh better  
mm-hmm  
infrared light  
because yeah because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel changing  
okay uh welcome you all  
mm-hmm  
well at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they  
yeah yeah the play doh was best i thought  
i dunno  
yeah you see i don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others  
i was was gonna say you can't get a lot of r. s. i. <unk> just get jaw ache  
yeah  
people might buy  
well  
okay  
i mean a bird  
uh not button  
this thing is really bizarre  
yeah okay  
mm mm  
well okay yeah  
well i think <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you can actually mark it if it isn't altering what's in the manual  
so well uh type supplements  
yeah  
uh then we will uh discuss uh well how it should be and uh  
first thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management  
so you yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
it's not that in china it's different  
um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it  
the scroll wheel i mean  
<unk>  
i mean what i see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is  
and also yeah  
and especially the slides  
still that was one of the requirements we had  
and it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about  
what's the average price of this technology then  
ooh  
but i perhaps investigate some time still to  
are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light  
yep i agree  
no not anymore  
which one  
to  
so <unk> so there's there's a lot of tracks here right  
yeah  
well there is  
um sarah she's recommended that we go for simpler functions so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to  
mm  
maybe a banana or <unk> or something  
mm-hmm  
um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off <unk> up and down it depends  
so it just it just makes it a lot easier um to get that  
with eye candy ear candy whatever  
in fact we already have this for a coffee maker line  
so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an r. r. on it  
right  
because it's  
my personal uh <unk> favourite is the kinetic provision because uh i ha  
because  
uh  
it's it's chew proof  
and yeah so that  
i think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost then i'd put them in but if it's  
it's in the good section  
one nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber  
yeah you can navigate  
yeah  
is it best if i send you an email maybe to let you know it's there  
and and when they're tired they're quite cute as well so  
if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five <unk> uh euro but  
we use the colours now  
uh no that must have been before me  
so we should change this as well  
and anyway  
mm-hmm  
if i interpret correctly  
but if we make a right handed and a left handed then  
we <unk> all the fruits and contacted nasa and uh made some real good yeah  
the eva the evaluation the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six  
um so up down keys for that uh channel keys up down  
mm-hmm  
there  
yeah <unk>  
alright  
well there are lots of good ideas that are recorded and someone will  
i don't know how much time we have left  
if you have uh have um smooth walls it it it probably you're probably right  
we when you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original  
am i do you think i'm stretching the uh the use of the banana  
or are they making purchasing decisions  
uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way i think we can just go on with that  
picture from scanner clip art  
we could leave that to the cover department  
yeah  
here  
you give it the full functions in here and just a couple of functions in there  
so uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting  
yeah  
is that a board marker pen actually  
so we'll get to that later i guess  
yeah  
so if we make a trendy design we sure have seventy <unk> seventy five percent of the market which you can reach  
yeah  
those are probably the the th  
do you need the border  
with the wheel it's easy  
yes it it it should be <unk> be visible nearly anywhere in the room  
<unk> it it's much <unk>  
and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation  
um okay so <unk> the <unk> email said that teletext is now outdated so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control  
but uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh <unk> <unk> <unk> dat  
but the um  
everything  
oh we still i guess  
mm  
okay  
okay so thank you very much indeed and i'll <unk> see you all again in thirty minutes  
right  
okay  
it's better like that isn't it  
no  
maybe  
okay  
when you get worried go to <unk> okay  
mm  
right  
uh line width  
they make left handed scissors you know  
when you have yeah the the goal results uh then yeah in fact it's not a shot change  
well this seems to me yes some computer program but i didn't find it yet  
uh a and so i haven't heard anything back from them  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh well uh so basically i started reading about the features that's taking the long temporal and uh time frame that's uh traps  
we weren't doing components  
yeah we can't drop them  
i dunno i dun i dun one each  
i'll build a dictionary as soon as i get the text  
yes  
yeah i think it's uh it has more market actually  
whether it you know whether the casing be <unk> any colour could be any colour  
the slide card and the video card are both s. d. k.  
yeah  
and uh  
uh and then he'll see the final display and he'll <unk> that it was all fake that we didn't actually do any of the work  
yeah the <unk> the means were very very good the means we used  
okay  
no no i mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels  
but not looking at their individual and <unk> fact they probably will avoid looking directly  
yeah mm-hmm  
yeah  
'cause what what i'm i'd be a bit worried about is if someone was <unk> had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they  
yeah  
or  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
it's more uh  
are there any um ideas for the remote  
it's a pretty high learning curve it'll be easy once you've done it but  
seem to be having  
alright so we need uh okay  
oh i have that those <unk> numbers  
but i could market that as a um as a a i was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road in terms of battery you know  
please press it  
well yeah the colours are yellow and grey  
<unk>  
and they sometimes might feel uncomfortable discussing this with their well in the presence of their p. h. d. students  
it's a unique item uh  
um i'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there there's a shared project documents folder  
yes  
you're the marketing expert okay  
cool  
yeah lower  
yeah  
yeah  
sebastian  
it is possible  
okay  
yeah yeah  
it should work  
oh course yeah that's true  
mm-hmm  
yeah but it's a scroll and click isn't it  
and also because we want to control that machine we use also the midi time code the midi time code to start and to stop the machine  
yeah  
right  
i've had one person with a <unk> headphone with with <unk> something where most of the time it's it's as if they've got their hand over something  
okay  
like volume and like this key  
okay that's why i like dogs  
yeah  
alright  
yes  
okay  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
you you already made a beta version or  
i think i'm gonna start downloading it yeah  
and i think we need the  
yeah  
it's a rabbit with uh broken legs  
yes yes  
mm-hmm um especially if we try to sell what two million of them  
you have if you press them for a long time  
remote control has got innovative technology implanted  
now we gave it enough thought though  
mm-hmm  
a small icon  
is it is it uh id do you have any sort of <unk> idea of what sort of band widths  
the same channel on the screen  
we'll combine everything after this  
that makes sense  
have you been <unk> has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers  
so i'll give it a two  
so if uh we draw we have to save everything  
i want to open the my <unk> oh no  
i think if you had a larger group  
working design  
<unk>  
thank you  
yeah let's have <unk> transcribe that  
right  
i'm a bad drawer  
think it's a re reaction remote control so  
but  
it's in your family in your home  
something like this  
yeah yeah sure  
yeah  
okay  
it's called uh the real remote  
and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested  
okay  
okay  
oh no  
yeah  
but uh i think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating  
construct two is um two green squares okay  
so so if we make the cross over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote  
yeah yeah  
no but that's the gadget they want or the gimmicks  
mm-hmm  
i find it quite cheap actually  
yeah but i'm i'm meaning if you move on to these corpora yeah  
yeah i was thinking that as well  
if your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer uh you find it yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm yes  
that has been that has been dictated pretty much by the company  
i don't see the necessity of an l. c. d. either  
isn't it  
it's uh  
yeah  
but the i would be happy paying over forty for it i guess but not much  
white  
no  
but the way that i interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly  
yeah  
ah very bad  
something that'll allow us to skip over between devices and that's kinda it  
second seems to be conceptual components properties materials and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far  
yeah yeah yeah <unk> exactly  
um the oh well um i don't know the <unk> stuff  
maybe we can have a wheel for incremental  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
the parallel index is something you desi derive  
so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of l. c. d. thing could be as high as the t. v. itself  
yeah so  
yeah  
and here's the agenda for this meeting  
that's really hard yeah  
yeah we gotta  
you didn't have you hadn't seen any prior data then you might see a bigger contribution as well  
mm-hmm  
you didn't know that you were gonna have a budget  
hmm  
save everything to the shared documents is that right  
uh <unk> h. f. e. s. database uh with j. ferret uh  
uh it's  
but let's see about that  
yeah  
uh is it maximum  
so  
the electronics could be <unk> either placed externally or internally makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control so that's good  
i don't see the spongy part in it  
uh <unk> a three  
could it be an on off thing  
right r. r. s. i. sensitive  
mm-hmm  
well yeah that is not it's not an issue  
mm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so i i i think it's <unk> <unk> <unk>  
but he did  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah so they're used for going into and out of your <unk> yeah  
so that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
wonderful  
a bit of a split mode  
well but in order to <unk> set a <unk> oh i guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're <unk> through  
um i mean uh i guess it's <unk> it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh  
yeah  
okay  
look at look at this one  
uh you know in a sense i never tried for example eventually to ask for one person dedicated to this because i always had the feeling that you are very interested  
ah  
so  
um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the  
mm-hmm  
so i guess the question is is it important to what what's it important to  
yeah  
that uh <unk> perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want  
that's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while maybe this is the new version  
so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade offs that we've got and the other ideas  
so we only ne we only need two for that  
well  
but you do <unk>  
very too expensive to do  
yeah  
hmm  
the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp  
yeah and this is no no no uh this is done on the fly  
our management is really looking for us to push our brand  
or <unk> maybe we can just kind of uh uh  
yeah but i think you have to hit escape  
yes  
up the numbers or the up down  
hmm  
and speech recognition in remote unit it will be very <unk> expensive  
it's not very uh  
maybe for volume control  
but uh please if you think you don't have the time or the energy to do it  
um  
well that's possible why why it should be i impossible  
yeah <unk> let's just uh delete all these uh or  
and i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking  
well uh you can use well when you use the buttons they'll they'll be made of rubber too  
okay  
can we draw it to make sure that that um that this is satisfying ellen's concerns  
it's hard <unk> i it's easy for you to remember it  
imagine you're doing it with your left hand i don't think it's too  
do <unk> do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um  
i guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition  
yeah maybe i should try something different and just programme it for myself  
back in ninety two  
um then yes it's like you know  
i think i think it's a good idea  
well let's begin  
i wanna see <unk> <unk> what my my handwriting looks like <unk> because my handwriting is crap  
it's probably the best place to do it  
okay that's not a problem  
<unk> master thesis should be defended in a couple of months or something like that  
uh yes  
<unk>  
technical functions  
and there will also be presumably some kind of task hierarchy <unk> going on in i mean 'cause the whole browser working group um final um sort of presentation on that second day was about  
you think it could lost  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
yeah  
yep  
um  
mm-hmm  
just to tie it in a little  
a. p. o. g. e. e. that might be the corporate colour scheme although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red  
just just uh just tell me when it is ready  
you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else  
but it is implemented on the a. s. r.  
so when you've when you've pressed we're finished it pings back at you  
uh  
yeah  
so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to  
and i don't think we are 'cause that's not a <unk> feature in the spectrum we're looking at  
okay  
i mean like the information is coming from off line  
no  
cool  
but i mean once we it maybe it's something that's <unk>  
like you <unk> there would only be one version of your data and you can just override that version if you want  
oh it is only for <unk>  
but then it's a little bit  
it's like like a number one  
sounds brilliant to me  
mm-hmm  
that's actually just gonna happen today and we will have proper segments as well  
yeah  
okay  
but  
yeah it will be then the other disk  
mm  
but uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera  
um and i think you all have been self stimulating of working together  
yep  
so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns  
probably until easter  
anyways  
if we have a smaller  
okay for the location  
hmm  
i it's too dull  
the ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with  
oh i see what you're saying  
that's what  
hide it in the fruit basket  
uh it's it's okay that i don't know 'cause uh it's not my field  
not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something  
but the difference between them and the the parts of the <unk> thing to be constructed is that they're allowed to overlap with other things so nothing breaks  
so using some l. c. d. <unk> we can touch so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh i dunno the name l. c. d. responding to fingers  
yeah so currently because there is a time code uh video time code  
uh right damped lyman see again that's uh these are source types the um i mean it's not a source type  
but they'll notice it after like a year they'll be like hey i have never changed the battery  
uh yeah  
and if we make  
just the <unk>  
it's doing different things all the time  
yes but we have to decide about these now  
scroll wheel for uh the the channels  
hmm  
that's the remote in itself that's the components of the remote and how they work together  
um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page  
where's delete button  
so  
but you know we can use it for a t. v. easily  
each uh led is actually three <unk> um  
you're also um responsible for resolving any um uncertainties that were marked by the original transcriber  
um so we are putting together a new remote control  
hi kate  
after a cat a turtle and a dog  
has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage anything they think that might have been missed so far  
no no it's <unk>  
no not that one  
okay  
we are not  
okay  
um well as i just showed there's a project management folder a project document folder on the desktop  
which one  
it'll it'll be an actual like circle and area  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
anna  
yeah yeah  
yes  
yeah let's leave it as zero 'cause it's easy  
on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice <unk> fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm  
mm-hmm  
yes <unk> i think you have to uh to uh  
otherwise you get uh a standard uh plastic colour  
oh same shape and colour  
yeah but but <unk> but daniel <unk> that's that's another brand  
right  
yeah  
oh okay  
um if we're at the moment abandoning abandoning the concept of displaying the whole series of meetings just because it's for us like more bureaucracy  
but you will have to make consensus with  
uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into  
um i mean i imagine as well that the actual l. c. d. and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality  
uh will it be easy to use  
yeah  
maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean  
it'll be really cheap  
uh i can see that  
it would be more <unk> i mean it would be a bit more work but then  
oh no  
thank you  
alright these functions  
really cute  
well  
and uh i i i think it's positive if there's a a led uh uh a led on the corner of the of the remote  
volume up volume up and and he's coming you know he's really annoyed with this down up down  
yeah  
many  
kind of circle  
'cause there is not just one dominant component but usually more others which are quite small right  
so the idea is uh okay <unk> we have in the lab a notion about um root mirroring  
you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning how would you like your coffee  
so the the top <unk> the power source yes  
this one  
yeah  
to mm-hmm  
good job  
actually maybe  
which have a couple of of their own buttons  
yeah  
kinda  
mm-hmm  
with you laptop  
i think you can if you have a scale so  
mm-hmm  
and use your other hands  
whoops  
if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some  
and you you can  
that is not a source type  
yeah  
extend  
'cause you know you wouldn't want it to be the morning you were supposed to be recording and then suddenly discover yeah  
but if we  
hmm  
actually i'm not so sure because i'm the you know if i was using a remote control to say  
yeah  
so the project method is the following  
um but um the feel of the material should be spongy which is contrary to last year apparently  
you'd know what you were fiddling with  
mm i see  
okay  
okay  
right  
and if neither then we'll have to put something else  
it's true for me then  
like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me i ended up you know like writing down there or something so i could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that  
okay  
you have playstation also  
the update  
yep i just missed it  
right right  
hmm  
right  
what do you mean <unk> is there anything i wanna  
people have made what's most important  
okay we  
uh-huh  
did it with ten kilo hertz and it's just really clear where you can tell exactly where exactly where the beep is now  
of the um <unk> going to do or <unk> or what each function <unk> going to do  
so let's say we play the whole au phrase but then in addition to that we have some information that says minus that part of something  
yeah  
um right sorry  
buttons are accessible from your thumb  
you can start to do this and uh once uh people have speech recognition or uh far enough to <unk>  
especially with yellow  
well they <unk> they basically can have speech recognition  
nice uh well show us  
there there's move events  
back to the pen  
um yeah it is just in time very handy  
and and the layout of of the thing itself  
um  
ye  
with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology  
yeah probably  
no it's the university is maybe it's really big so they can afford for  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
but still i think i it depends  
so it's pretty powerful and that's that's why the <unk> buttons are reduced because of this feature  
yeah i dunno  
and the joystick is for the volume and the channels  
fifty per cent of of the <unk> <unk> like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it  
um in this case it's the function of the remote control which is to send messages to the television television set  
yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer  
so can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said  
if we added the screaming factor then we go up  
um i'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and i'm i don't know about anybody else  
on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is <unk> my understanding of it  
so  
well so there's no real time there's only <unk> there's only events  
it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it <unk> somewhere away on the remote  
i am worried about like um using a menu  
easy to use  
and other other less important things are screen settings audio settings and channel settings but  
um and gives you yeah more flexibility there  
just i'm sure there's a  
and i don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to  
yeah originally i brought it because i marked some papers but yeah  
yeah  
the back end of an elephant  
i mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a t. v. or to the number or singles who have a television  
yeah i just had a presentation to  
mm  
mm-hmm  
yeah i think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the t. v. doesn't have a menu then  
i know  
oh i thought i put in my last name i guess not but  
i think my favourite animal would be a dog but i'm not really sure how to draw one  
yes  
ready for this  
yeah  
oh no  
the  
um maybe i i can i can  
um  
wow  
the way we'll be allocating this is is the same as before th it's gonna be on the th the same the same page just further down  
yes  
mm-hmm  
that's  
what i want  
yeah okay but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours six hours five six hours then  
yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control  
you know already when you have done this processing uh <unk> which part of the frequencies of the spectrum um belongs to this person and to that person  
one me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons  
um now  
mm-hmm  
it's part of the introduction okay  
i'd say <unk> yeah one  
alright  
give it a one  
<unk> not in the  
okay  
mm-hmm  
alright  
you know emailing somebody to find out who knows this information  
'kay  
well all i th understood you to ask for was the duration of each fixation inside  
no but  
mix uh several function in one button  
yeah  
okay  
yep mm-hmm  
but there's also quite a big space where we don't know the literature from the other side  
and and again here as we sort of move <unk> sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this  
next channel  
like for example you can take proceedings and assume the categories are the keywords of the of the <unk> of the documents  
it <unk> it would seem silly if we'd having anything else just have an audio button though  
and we should never forget about it  
well it reads them into separate arrays and then you can just change a flag to select one i which one it gives back  
the the yeah <unk> well you <unk> you've got a point  
mm  
yeah  
so um yeah this is my name  
i dunno close the windows whatever turn the heating on and um  
um  
where do we do that  
um did you read something regarding the diva project  
yeah i think that would be it then  
like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables  
yeah  
could these be used for going to <unk> or  
okay  
hmm  
now even the clean speech you are getting  
pardon  
so are we discounting solar energy because <unk> gonna be used in there somewhere or  
okay  
sound  
yes  
the  
thanks for your collaborations  
a th a three  
h. p.  
yeah  
uh probably not  
yeah  
so  
and how long does that take  
if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that we will put we will put apple shape casing on that  
mm-hmm  
that's harsh  
okay  
of course hmm  
so so you just multiply that uh one hilbert carrier which is transcribed by l. s. f. <unk> by that this one i. f. f. t. signal  
oh yeah i forgot to mention that  
mm not maximum  
yeah that's yeah exactly  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> yeah let's take away the  
'cause uh i'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here at least in general but  
and the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher  
uh  
and if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker  
so we need to yeah  
i dunno if this will start making it more complicated but it could increase the popularity of the of the remote  
to make make people aware of the product  
at least for what buttons we're gonna use  
because <unk> um this right yep and okay things are typically also back channels  
uh <unk> um what's your last name  
or a clap  
zoom opt ah yeah of course yeah  
open  
yeah yeah obviously those kinds of things are things we'll have to work around but um yeah it's just one of those details  
so we have to decide if we're going to use  
and then i mean <unk> <unk> <unk> you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half euro and  
no wood i wood's not an option  
but you still but you then still need to have  
i think two or three  
um  
spongy  
yeah  
um the other thing we're we  
i mean we all do  
oh yeah  
<unk> i no i don't think i did i  
um i mean yeah on the on the l. c. d. i mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves  
mm-hmm and what is this here  
what would you recommend  
just let's be careful about that because  
like uh home phones  
okay  
yeah yeah yes  
yeah  
yeah  
so i think i'm not sure if you can put some research into that if it's possible  
sounds reasonable  
results were almost identical um which says to me there's something wrong with the data rather than and it's nothing serious  
alright  
<unk> just think twenty five euros i mean it's not going to be cheaper  
<unk> okay  
something like that  
yeah  
that's a pity  
don't forget about that  
probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end i would have to agree  
but it's generated from a gaussian space from a from a a space so it's given a a mean and <unk> uh and  
uh no no no  
yeah uh three four four two six seven seven <unk> yeah one <unk> exactly  
and it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other <unk> yeah other entertainment devices  
um so i see i see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design but yeah you don't want to lose out on  
fruits and vegetables  
yeah i don't think we're gonna have time for that  
yeah you can you should you have to lose  
but at least these things okay like it won't really make mistakes so often like sometimes  
then you can uh  
thank you  
so that's a human decision  
so so we just ended the just ended the the dutch stream yeah the video and our audio  
'cause you got a <unk> you got a list of where the where the beeps are  
um it took a while to get this uh  
deaf people  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah that's great  
the energy source uh i've got a lot of possibilities for that too  
switching  
thanks guys  
yeah  
i think there's one one more to go  
so it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here  
you can  
oh feature absolutely  
uh but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote  
well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in  
just if you want yeah  
no  
uh i think they've um they're not waiting anything from us  
well it depends if it's a remote control th  
uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself  
is that in this one though  
mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability  
yeah  
well if you do language adaptation there should be no problem  
i think it is  
everything else we can really we can really  
these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account  
okay right so we're writing down four  
and let's go back to agenda and hook me up  
but  
or  
whatever you wish  
the other thing is that would mean we'd be using their parser as well which means we wouldn't have to parse anything which be quite nice  
well any colour  
yes  
so what you're saying is that a page is partly from its text that you've got on the page and it's partly from what the links say it's about  
<unk> no no  
um i think plastic and rubber would be fine but plastic rubber and wood i wasn't i'm not very sure about the titanium  
whatever i don't know thing th i don't know whether that a  
i think one of our <unk> priorities is tech technology  
well yeah  
that's pretty much the the whole process for today  
i'd have thought  
um  
yeah  
um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel  
mm  
can you handle that black and yellow  
but for the other thing you know uh uh the alternative measures  
you you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch  
how about  
philips has this  
i don't know what you think  
hasn't been clear to me  
um this exercise um did the company board tell you to do it or uh did you just make it up yourself  
do <unk>  
i'm <unk>  
to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too  
yeah or we could replace it  
i think well we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something  
and and it was the negotiation of which candidate was gonna be the right candidate that's actually the interesting stuff  
yeah  
yeah  
because anything with absolute <unk> sort of stupid because that means that a long long segment gets to one percent of its length and another one gets to exactly the same length and stuff  
so the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings and uh  
uh for example the energy source  
i think that's all  
um  
yeah  
thank you  
mm-hmm  
flashy and yeah  
mm  
we have something  
so the first thing i have to do is close this so that i can get to  
yeah that's there  
well yeah i prefer to use it only for t. v.  
right  
twelve fifty  
okay  
oh okay  
mm  
and then vector <unk> or whatever  
mm-hmm  
um then the case material itself so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex  
if it looks um  
so it's a one or a i don't know  
it could be really straightforward for the computer  
except for me now  
you're gonna give a presentation for us then  
this was my favourite one but  
uh i like the pens  
and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups so i mean we are sort of beholden to them  
that becomes more complex but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls  
mobile phone  
okay so that that's not uh yeah that those are  
yeah thirty nine  
yeah  
but uh  
so in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have <unk>  
because in the <unk> when there th were the flats in i lost all my papers from my school  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that's what i know about them  
okay  
that's the problem  
okay  
mm the scroll button from the survey we never see that people would like to have some <unk> button  
you had some very strange layout  
mm  
th  
kinetic one  
sure  
last time i did that it <unk>  
mm-hmm  
of course they do  
okay well so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary  
okay yeah  
does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like  
if we lose the l. c. d. then we have an uh regular chip and no l. c. d.  
okay  
but for the technical part  
mm-hmm  
we put fashion into electronics  
do we have a fancy look and feel according to you  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that plus i guess it's actually straightforward to say to start with is this a small world network and then run it on that  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so maybe i should include that here as well l. c. d. <unk> um plus spinning  
double curved um but also something that was gonna jump out at people  
voice recognition is quite tough  
um they you know seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on  
yeah  
or function f. eight  
yeah  
don't think so  
yeah  
if we do uh two integrated scroll wheel push buttons we can drop all the the push buttons  
so i don't know i don't know whether having  
uh just one person at a time of course  
wow  
just say okay it's fine  
but i mean one of the things one of the things you'd like to establish you know  
mm  
so um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small so you can put it in  
okay twenty eight thirty eight <unk> forty six  
yeah okay  
this one is engineering <unk> so this one has the most functions and um things  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
uh first of all i'll explain what a user interface is  
four six seven eight  
you think a single curved  
also two  
okay well my conclusion um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than i thought  
right  
so for a demo i think realistically since everything in this university sort of works in one hour slots and stuff  
right  
presentation where we have a look at the <unk> th that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us and we can use that to tell  
possibly yeah  
thank you  
ah ha look at that showing up already  
let's say you have four of them  
uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it <unk> it's just a box  
yep  
five  
so  
i think we totally succeeded there  
mm-hmm  
um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups concerning the features  
a a a normal button on the remote control or norm  
that that's our new slogan  
just like the watch from seiko  
high definition d. v. d. and  
yeah  
no now we are <unk> exceeding i think  
well maybe i dunno  
uh  
doesn't really say  
um bug  
alright  
we've been taking out line as a  
okay  
what's the button well <unk> <unk> then what's the button do and how do you know that that is what the button does  
okay  
but anyway anyway  
yeah in  
hello sebastian  
okay  
yeah  
two  
it makes it twelve yeah  
my computer  
we could set up a a marketing uh agreement  
so it's uh  
yep  
it's a lot easier  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
in yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
means of having <unk> the digital pens and all that kind of good things  
'kay  
it's called the real remote right  
so  
bumper or something  
uh-huh  
this one  
if you want to look at it um well just do  
next  
no  
it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped  
infrared galaxies  
cool  
missus  
yep  
yeah  
um and we also  
so i  
english  
so i plug it in press f. five  
but yeah  
yep  
i'm a excellent project manager  
hmm  
no no  
the the <unk> the the functions are trendy  
i think you see more silver than black  
can i say something  
yeah that's right  
okay  
now in neither case when you draw this he's looking at triangle one which you're actually drawing you know  
you have to <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
um well  
i mean he was speaking about innovation  
i really like the way you have it but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to  
okay  
oh  
yeah it it's supposed to be bit <unk> bit <unk> bit yeah  
okay  
and we can come back to it you said  
great  
yeah  
i am but i am just going to talk about this one  
yeah  
okay  
the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of <unk> electric <unk> do you want to have  
oh that's a bit big  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh oh talk about it later  
easy powerful  
what  
that'll it literally would just be a button  
okay  
it should be fine  
yeah it's  
'kay but teletext is so uh is just scrapped  
yeah that's  
mm  
uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here  
yeah  
so if there uh if mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so you haven't looked at what's in there and what isn't in there that you need to do some really intensive transform to do  
and again lot of this stuff like <unk> even when i was working mostly that company was developing for voice over i. p.  
just  
yeah  
yeah  
that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly <unk> identified in the product  
it really matters <unk> what frame shift you're using for models like because how many he needs to use same <unk>  
mm-hmm  
you always could have a look at the time stamps and then take the ones that uh belong together to form an utterance  
okay  
<unk> easy to use  
let's um see um  
yeah it's a big uh big eraser  
no not <unk>  
so how are we gonna display the search for this corpus  
okay  
no uh the younger group likes uh more <unk>  
i i just have to uh to think which <unk> mine 'cause i was uh bit in a hurry  
'kay  
put it mildly  
i would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person  
yeah  
okay  
you scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to  
yeah  
uh yeah yeah  
but uh  
'kay  
surrounding the logo  
uh well it depends how how many i can book in and get get running  
so we can  
yeah  
you just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop  
yeah  
yeah i don't um i wish  
yeah  
do you think that people like the colour yellow  
no i said five  
we were able to do it with that kind of chip  
i think uh <unk> especially for design issues it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them  
yeah  
okay  
which has it also has play stop and pause and everything i don't think we need them at all  
uh okay the interface options now  
we can we can make its i think  
right  
what  
triple a  
um the second teletext uh and the third uh volume controls  
it's just people are used to seeing that so if we didn't have them then they might think it's  
you also uh see uh this device it's not very round and fruity of course  
which is good  
just trying to make some sense of that code and see how does the representation work in their system  
and then if <unk>  
yeah  
what did you guys think about the the the roles  
hmm  
uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly  
which uh then you can fit the l. c. d. screen in it and can decide uh  
didn't it  
they also want to see my cat and his rabbit and uh  
no  
so i think that's right as long as this is  
shall we just go around the table  
yeah  
uh well i'll try my best to draw  
right  
uh let me see  
a simple dull uh one coloured box  
<unk> you need to like press two and five and yeah  
yeah yeah 'cause i'll go gotta <unk> that format and then once that's done i've gotta start looking at the analysis side of it  
right so we've got i. d. the come on where's my  
huh  
don't know  
which  
yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue  
true  
yes uh encrypted uh with  
and it it wouldn't be any work at all in terms of programming or something  
because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm <unk> you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and  
okay  
the blinking  
'kay  
yeah exactly  
so um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea  
uh  
uh we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it  
properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching  
uh it is in shared documents  
and copy this  
but  
yeah not exactly legs but  
you can do it for fifty cents  
the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it but  
we are not sure about what kind of microphone we should use  
mm  
most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote  
mm-hmm  
so first we have a <unk> now  
that's just off the top of my head  
or  
i don't think that counts  
but i'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit  
yeah  
yeah  
i am not very good at uh this kind of stuff  
yeah  
so if we have it like a monday monday the <unk> probably be quite good for the final deadline  
you will do it  
i'm writing very fast  
yeah  
alright  
i think so yeah  
it's a possibility  
so i think that could have been better  
these this is a bit larger than it would be but  
mm  
'kay save it as an image on the <unk>  
mm-hmm  
<unk> um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print  
<unk> come in at sixteen  
the slogan is yeah the <unk> we put the fashion in electronics isn't it  
uh five hundred hertz though  
so both of those concepts  
and okay yeah i'm with martin  
yeah  
but now the first the buttons  
like uh put it like the shape  
okay  
it has a shape  
so maybe plastic is not uh sufficient  
it puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to <unk> to make these two most basic functions extra big like <unk>  
i i will first i would like to have your views what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not  
yeah i can remember when i start being a <unk> when i was <unk> starting being a student  
uh i'll try i'll try  
to have a positive you know even based on the four of us being heavily biased um  
or okay so just yeah you can rest it on your finger  
um  
okay  
well um is it possible to make an l. c. d. screen uh how was the information  
okay  
yeah i don't i it's it's a problem with the international uh appeal i think  
well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your t. v. and that that is bit of a tricky job  
mm-hmm  
but mobile <unk>  
th th there were different options we discussed then we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget  
yeah but then  
so i really enjoy their their singing you they're really beautiful animals  
the l. c. d. would  
or  
data i think we should keep in  
okay  
it's party party remote control  
right  
yeah  
oh  
so your  
it  
i yeah it's yeah i can forward you that  
and so um <unk> simplified it quite and you know <unk> and rich and collagen have simplified it quite a bit  
mm-hmm  
okay it's upside down  
turn the volume up because i can't hear it very well  
yeah that would be a good idea yeah  
uh uh i think that will be great  
so you have categories and and entries so for example you have i dunno cars s. u. v. etcetera  
uh f. f. t. also  
uh  
um i don't know if you want andre to go through his first or if you have any questions for me  
that true but <unk> we have included <unk> power law though  
fair fair enough if you want  
no yeah that that makes <unk> yeah that makes a lot more sense yeah  
uh and here you basically here with a histogram uh you can see it very flat  
is i  
<unk> like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used channel selection a hundred and sixty eight  
well you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels  
so yeah  
so  
we're over  
um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here  
next  
uh  
and everything being wait we have what sound system t. v. d. v. d. v. h. s. uh <unk>  
'kay uh that that's very uh with rubber so it's very  
mm  
it's a marks the kind of <unk> feature doesn't it  
it's taking it a little bit  
we have a technical problem  
would we get that many people wanting to give talks  
yeah  
rubber buttons require rubber case  
mm-hmm  
well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular  
i think it's quite useful when you're at that stage to see the different kinds of technologies people use  
the parental control will be incorporated but it must be not too complex  
uh yeah but  
oh okay yeah sure uh  
th i think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea  
i'm gonna get kicked if i don't do it so  
it's kinda fun  
so can you just summarize briefly the differences between your two proposals the key differences  
so we have the logo up there  
do we  
um  
three  
of function is  
mm-hmm  
okay <unk>  
yeah  
no  
right  
i would like to change  
yeah yeah yeah that's also true  
right  
um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment  
mm-hmm  
if i've not over stepped  
what people's preferences on that were so i dunno know if that's coming to me later or something like that  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
like uh an hour glass kind of figure is that what you're thinking of or just like a  
yeah yeah  
yeah so sounds  
yeah  
oh  
mm  
we shall  
the other way around you mean  
actually all i got around to do  
just throwing it out there  
so that should in principle <unk> longer utterances  
let's take take the basic design again what we oh crap uh came up with  
i've more information on possible materials um as well  
yeah then mm  
okay c. g. i. here  
i would say then uh  
'cause if you look at you look at what <unk> done here olivia wouldn't have just highlighted that line  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
and you're going to be the user interface is it  
your turn  
it's curved like this  
i'm sorry  
that's the <unk>  
three i will say three  
uh-huh  
mm  
mm-hmm  
well more or less what we didn't do is analysis by synthesis right  
mm no i'm happy to take that out  
but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller  
um and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium in brussels in april first  
so we don't have to code all the communication process et cetera  
i mean i i if you if it would cost two euros that had a total a total thing  
okay  
uh  
and our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty  
we have uh we have speech recognition we have location based we have l. c. d.  
the basic functionality that people want  
because if you if you take them as separate events you get thousands of separate events  
source  
thanks  
mm-hmm  
and you have also advanced um chips  
'cause i think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc <unk> what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out  
and now i mean there is there are um mm there is research uh um <unk> that's been published showing  
no that's that's  
these are the three things that um will have an impact on you  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
okay so you can you can go  
and by limiting them we are limiting our sales limiting our profit also  
alright  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an o. e. m. component for the radio wave circuit  
therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time  
but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows but uh uh  
so do you already know where uh what is the situation with you  
okay  
um well i don't know who wants to go first with his presentation  
yes  
okay  
glad to hear that  
uh yeah  
the ti the start time all the <unk> all the <unk> you could have uh <unk>  
yeah yeah  
definitely  
um not that we haven't done i think the best we could have done  
that's more your uh your department to to uh to  
huh  
okay  
alright  
no i was just looking this  
and if i find something that you can't get out of it then i can add that to the add that to the g. d. f. format  
uh i don't know if there is a strong constraint but i think we are doing pretty well  
i mean slide transition we would use slide uh need to do it slide transition  
we've got more than one <unk> though haven't we  
yeah  
mm  
and here on this one you can uh draw the pictures and things like that  
and then then it <unk> then it has some more uh energy  
yeah like <unk> voice recognition is too much i think  
yes but but but ab about the spec the buttons the buttons uh that will be on it  
okay  
yeah  
yeah i think the spinning wheel is definitely very now  
um i will put the minutes i just made in the project documents folder  
yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one so  
okay  
but you can't make a remote control without them because  
does the pay raise immediately come into effect on our next pay check or is that  
but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh  
sort of like until here it's the meeting about this thing and then it's that thing and then it's it's this like  
mm-hmm  
sometimes they play a movie  
uh yeah  
that might get redundant also maybe  
i think i'd probably increase the cost  
that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it  
yeah  
yeah  
no would <unk> then it would just be a straight remote  
okay  
um so i think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something  
one  
um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria if you've developed some  
but this is the same uh  
it's more really about having a comfortable place to sit um where it's not an office environment it doesn't look anything like an office  
and the remote control was not a great kind of <unk> um keypad for playing games  
alright  
um i'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through and then i'll send them to you after the meeting  
took this example actually not really decision but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers  
well <unk> we designed it so of course we are very  
you want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume  
okay i hope wait  
um  
yeah i see it  
um we've got uh teletext outdated  
so it um i think i will give it a yeah yeah yeah a four  
yeah  
now i've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and i i i've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us  
mm  
hold on  
so are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use are we going to use scroll buttons  
is that the uh well you've seen them i le <unk> my presentation that um i point out some why buttons are not the mm  
okay and maybe i should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point the leadership  
yeah yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge  
yes i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not <unk>  
no  
mark the la la  
yeah  
what slides  
you see what i mean  
mm-hmm  
well uh i'm uh and my uh function is user interface design  
like this  
maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view  
i think i would choose this one because of the colour  
even simpler  
mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls  
it's like fire safety  
yeah  
m.  
yeah it was to the like seven universities or something  
work in progress  
it's just that perceptual stuff and  
plus six i say i said seven  
great  
uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station  
a couple of weeks ago i looked at the for the flights and there are a lot of flights in one page so if if th  
well they'll buy more of them if you eat them  
i mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or  
uh switch to the next channel that sort of thing i think we're all quite uh  
uh we've got three presentations  
um i think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing  
um mm there's the l. c. d. screen um which maybe maybe is too expensive um but i think also at the scroll wheel  
your turn  
you have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work  
mm  
mm-hmm  
only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of it should be something light  
can't we have different colours in the remotes so somebody can choose different <unk> like does it have to be of a certain  
yes and and and then you get feedback via the l. c. d. yeah  
like this  
and down here  
no  
yeah  
two or three  
we could make a hello kitty  
but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote  
even if i if we have this lost unit then we cannot do it for that price  
and then the third main difference uh would be the the number of visitor places or free places  
yeah <unk> of course you you listen to it yourself  
maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost  
come on  
like a like a p. d. a. a hand held  
uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple  
okay  
given speech recognition i think <unk> you should go for the less fancy chip  
okay  
if your fashion is <unk> is carmen miranda you betcha  
so  
um so i would like to have a product that that we can sell easily  
forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group uh to put myself right in the middle of it  
yeah  
well in any way every time you write a paper you've got to go back and do this related work thing anyway  
transmitter  
no  
so we're to mainly design <unk> mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy and the material and interface  
that's before  
we could call it uh  
that's what they need it's like a little <unk> it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time  
uh yeah i wouldn't get too distracted i guess on <unk> <unk> if you've got two tracks i'd like to  
but i thought we were good orally  
leadership  
but maybe in future it will be a giant hit and when you are the first  
smoothed  
yeah  
right  
now our third  
okay  
um and then we can easy add i. d. <unk> for the two mouse points and the two gazes  
from linux it's very <unk> interesting  
well it looks uh yeah well um according to <unk> the the the market likes um new flashy technology  
mm-hmm  
and presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well  
yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions  
i think i maybe a mixture of both there maybe  
a base station that can control other things as well  
um so i thought you wanna probably set this alpha per page there's probably some heuristics  
uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button  
oh right right right um  
but we gonna uh do it here they said  
yeah  
no  
yeah  
well i  
and this is done at the um you have libraries  
mm-hmm yeah it's a difficult one  
so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it yeah  
yeah  
and i'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside  
yeah the the the yeah  
next meeting starts in thirty minutes  
okay  
where we put the buttons around like we'd put a big on off button or something else in the middle  
interesting  
yeah  
and um but for a standard one this is really easy  
okay um just at the <unk> yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works  
yeah  
uh this is uh <unk> paper on like variable scale feature extraction  
right also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting so didn't manage to forward it on to you  
okay  
but um it's like the hand dynamo no  
so i think it's worth asking them  
yeah sure  
<unk>  
yeah  
i had something but i forgot  
right all th these uh different buttons you have to  
i think  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i agree  
it's clear  
um  
he he he he me he means just just one other thing  
ooh  
mm  
yeah  
no  
okay  
um  
right  
so i mean <unk>  
so at the for the time being that's uh that's all  
especially this part  
having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of <unk> <unk> form and a bit more ergonomic as well  
you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t. v. or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions  
we can try  
yeah that's the problem  
why not  
the uh right sorry  
ah it's a baby shark it looks to me you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish no  
which means we have to get some portion of the data hand <unk>  
yes the the position the the radius of the  
i'll go  
that when you say something it will give a response and you program the response as well  
okay  
so it probably shouldn't be in there  
yeah if it was there's an absorption feature or absorption to see it the spectrum at this wave length  
what  
no an l. c. d. <unk> just like uh like a drawn here  
yeah  
uh the third feature is a stable triangle base  
you never use uh excel  
okay  
okay  
then you sort of have a a link between meetings for instance  
we we thought that <unk> for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy  
three plus one four  
no  
so we need uh well this is will be done together <unk> like in to to try to divide the time uh what do we do  
that's what i thought the first day as well  
i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings so time is also a very <unk> um strong factor and structure  
okay  
it's not very special but uh  
okay  
it also has seems to have channel up and channel down which is which is more what you'd expect from a  
yeah i guess so  
i got one which i it was french so i knew how to ex spell it  
so i would assume you know no more contact with joe  
i think you were right there  
so just about every utterance needs to be <unk> and and needs the end punctuation  
mm  
i always worry about the worst  
see you two in half an hour uh  
yeah  
okay  
right  
yeah definitely  
yes but but when you want to have something special  
mm-hmm  
no not l. c. d. so  
right  
if we have a a space issue we can also lose one battery  
so  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
this is what it <unk> yeah but it it was already what we're uh we're after  
expert  
no just thumb sized  
first of all i i think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons  
uh which can be buttons whatever which in fact  
mm-hmm  
okay  
and i propose to so uh about chips  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
on the market point of view yeah  
sure please do  
yeah  
i suppose the l. c. d. c. <unk> the one that's pushing it up a bit though  
so <unk> what  
<unk> <unk> they like fifteen members from brooklyn  
oh yeah  
yep  
that's well so that's that  
okay  
huh  
uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there  
yes  
and <unk> and stuff and  
this it's not a fruit it's a vegetable  
yeah and we don't have multiple things that it has to control it just has to control the t. v.  
i opened the meeting the product was developed uh and reviewed and we talked about the financial end of it  
um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time  
um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff right  
yeah yeah  
<unk> oh  
it's going to be lighter because this seems to be very heavy <unk> i mean for my daughter for instance  
or  
okay one battery  
i put single curved  
okay  
lots of good information there  
yeah  
oh okay  
<unk>  
oh  
yeah  
i'm not the boss  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
with the menu uh button  
so we add also the speech recognition device  
i uh i say two personally  
so so i think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the  
it is  
oops  
but for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros  
yeah  
yeah well then it's bit difficult to use  
since it's a ball it'll roll so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least down here somewhere take away that part  
and neither of them were very pretty you know  
mm  
i wasn't very keen on that but yeah  
ah  
okay  
um  
yeah  
no  
repetitive strain injury  
yeah guess i've asked this question fifteen times now  
what's up  
yeah  
so just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction this is uh so it right  
mm-hmm  
oh i don't know what it's doing  
every uh level of design consists of some individual work and we uh close it with a meeting  
because then you you have it uh <unk> you have lot of things which you can include for the people to  
yep sure that's cool um  
mm-hmm  
yep  
okay cover up the microphone  
yeah  
ah well i mean <unk> easy enough  
i will give i will  
yeah  
you <unk> unless you've got a t. v. the size of a football pitch it's not doesn't have to go that far does it  
no it's not so complex  
and now align <unk>  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
<unk> given that that it works then it's i think one  
two point four  
brussels amsterdam  
oh okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
okay  
oh costs nothing  
so that shouldn't be a problem  
no no it <unk> <unk> <unk> originally done  
mm-hmm  
they also like that but research is very uh costly  
there  
well i i'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out  
yep there we go  
um  
no  
any questions  
yeah  
then what you can do is that the you can make the t. v. screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel  
i would say uh let's let's yeah let's try to have one uh students uh to help us on that  
no i don't think so  
alright  
but anyway we can sort that out if we have time once we've got everything else  
and uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents  
no i don't think so  
it's like that  
at least they could give us time to i think that uh the most of those things should be there  
and have to be somewhat like bigger  
and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic  
mm-hmm  
but  
mm  
yeah yeah yeah i see  
leadership  
internet  
that's a problem  
yeah <unk>  
so you have sound  
that we have to check how fast that is like to say give us all the ones that whether that works with their query language  
i'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads  
i would say two  
three  
so true one or should i go to two or three  
uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh <unk> uh volume up  
but you <unk> you'd like them to run continuously  
um  
and things  
then i mean <unk> you can use it as a normal remote control but if you do want to use l. c. d.  
we can have the lunch  
but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway then it's it's not so much a problem perhaps  
yeah  
it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or <unk> sponge bob like things  
um  
so depends on the cost  
um  
yeah  
in the remote control which is an unusual feature in my opinion  
that's mostly the case from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case and if you have to do all this kind  
oh yeah and and we really leave a  
or also in terms of action  
yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there  
yeah  
i i thing is really  
uh one  
obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that i've been so how do i how do i get this up  
only the television  
'cause i think  
<unk> uh-huh  
<unk>  
that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much  
no discussion about it  
yeah  
so  
yeah  
you had a lot to go on  
six  
speech recognition  
yeah  
yeah  
well i think we might have a lot in common what we calculate because i for my latent semantic analysis need like counts of words within a document  
so anyway  
uh-huh  
yeah  
or you don't want to do that  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> so  
doesn't really matter  
yeah  
yeah  
technology  
um eighteen or or seventeen  
yeah yeah  
i think your lemon wasn't that far <unk> and if it doesn't work you know we've just made a lemon  
yeah  
we do  
i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design revisiting our original goals  
we <unk> we use plastic  
just for cruelty  
<unk> set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero right  
okay  
yeah  
hmm  
and so b. has some periods of looking at one and all it will which will also be intermittent  
no  
yeah  
so it's a good and a bad idea  
no  
hold that  
okay  
there's nothing more to it  
and when does it turn off  
like a cellphone  
yeah  
what is available in the market off the shelf  
everyone is <unk> really uh really glad to obtain an  
marked it yeah  
<unk> i started making stuff up then i got an email saying  
yeah it's it is very different yeah  
at least i think that's what i remember our problem was that  
number of components you plan to use  
part tandem training  
and no uh other uh <unk> functions than just t. v. but they <unk> do aim at a younger well ma  
okay that's reasonable  
well either way  
otherwise they'd call it a name  
could you <unk> take it off  
mm-hmm  
yeah company logo  
i suggested three  
yeah but <unk>  
excuse my language  
yeah  
and this is how everyone can access it and then we should be able to go from there  
yeah i mean just disconnect it from whatever it sends the media player and connect it up to our <unk>  
yeah if as far as possible  
then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do  
saying they need some new pens  
in two months yeah  
yeah but i'm a bit worried about the budget  
i think  
um so is there anything here that you  
i had to say  
where is my presentation  
there might be some higher level structure that you wanna pull out of that  
do we need the five buttons for channel change up down volume up down and on off  
count them  
and even the easy to use thing so it will be perfect  
'kay  
yeah i think this is just the preliminary get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would  
i i do  
uh and then we'll have a the prototype presentation  
banana  
yeah  
uh i'm your industrial designer so i <unk> well the point is  
on the television  
so that's not ideal  
no input like this  
so so they'll accrue all of the normal an annotations  
just like when you're writing on a letter  
mm-hmm  
i don't think it's too slow to do on line to be honest  
mm  
nice  
it's maximum and don't have to yeah yeah  
the minutes yeah  
definitely  
do you think maybe the prices were were made  
okay yeah  
you yeah you can just right  
yep  
or in the software or anything  
but i think we will need it  
okay well  
mm  
uh not too many one buttons  
so so here's a look inside your really old looking remote control  
see if i can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better  
yeah  
it's very important  
i think this is  
uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons  
okay  
it's off  
i'm not sure if we i think we should keep the the logo in mind  
uh yeah  
on meetings with some of the stuff that's been done on collaborative problem solving 'cause there's elements of each that seem really important  
okay  
so not at all  
mm-hmm  
and then lastly we're going to determine its working design how exactly will it perform its functions that's the whole technical side of  
okay  
oh  
yeah that's right  
specially distribution yeah  
i think uh it's a two  
yeah  
um right uh well next up then because we've done finance is the project evaluation  
okay  
next meeting starts in thirty minutes these are the individual actions  
for example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the <unk> our favourite characteristics about it  
we're going to <unk> discuss the functional requirements of the remote that <unk> that means that functions user <unk> want to have on the remote control or just  
yeah yeah the previous button is  
no well <unk> i mean uh <unk> you can go into your <unk> and tell him ha my <unk> uh remote control is kinetic  
mm  
so these are the two different ones  
but it could come in different colours and have the r. r. colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the r. r. logo or colours and  
hmm  
which is more or less like the <unk> if you really take a look on that  
or  
mm yeah  
i think there is a <unk> lot of money in that like right  
yeah  
mm  
the idea is to have more um a kind of uh art artistic uh feedback to have a kind of general feeling of what's going on  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
technological if they don't need to be 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down  
yeah  
why a turtle  
mm-hmm  
'kay i'll just be talking about the components design  
no we can't actually  
hasn't changed that much huh  
they wouldn't be <unk> able to use it half of the year you know  
okay and i will leave that leave it at that  
so these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this  
so i think we have full of idea  
everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it  
okay so we've got um the working design  
yeah  
ten sixteen  
yeah  
um  
ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about  
okay  
so would it be easy for you to to tie the things together  
so we give that one a five you think  
where the display is actually updating up here when it's moving on  
yay i'm supposed to draw the animal next  
okay  
that's right  
i did  
ami yeah project  
yeah  
for your model mm good  
'cause i was like it could go around the outside  
but  
okay  
yeah  
um  
i think she might be glad to see kinda there linguistics to adapt  
well these are  
no we don't use that  
any missed speech  
no <unk> some some televisions need the input first uh and and you <unk>  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
<unk> <unk> yeah  
yeah but there was  
and uh so what we have until now is the software that darren did for the frame grabbing  
alright we also said simplicity how <unk> how well does it address just being simple  
and when he was talking there was this whole like you know when you speak to close to a microphone and that was really horrible  
yeah like you have one two three four five six seven eight nine zero  
they they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's  
yeah <unk>  
i think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way so you know  
yeah two two three  
no  
<unk>  
traditional one  
uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well  
i suppose it sells because it's good  
you want  
i asked that once or like ask is it possible to get it off and nobody said like people were discussing about the technical <unk>  
right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design  
if we could choose more than one that would be my second choice  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
yes  
no  
i mean it's just like the paper i don't know what i really needed the paper for  
some other way  
okay  
and uh but i do like the yeah i do like uh the <unk> uh to the idea of making a a <unk> uh  
mm  
it's easy to <unk> <unk> know okay this is just the volume and this is the channel  
yeah  
but  
so can you just explain what that is real quick  
okay  
so that <unk> that that's that's your average baseline okay okay  
yeah  
most <unk> be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty  
or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop  
it's just a segmentation  
and um you know you just <unk> stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit  
so it wa from <unk> it was in the <unk> library  
yeah oh it's so horrible  
thanks  
yeah  
yeah we have to pull it this way huh  
okay  
and the super topics are in the end what the meetings are but in general at some level super topics are treated like like topics  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
or tara  
okay so by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source we've got a single curved  
um the a. w. d. <unk>  
speech recognition i think it's very hard because we're selling across multiple countries  
that's the finance  
um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a <unk> uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer  
<unk>  
seventeen divided by <unk>  
mm  
it's uh one of our ideas  
i think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself doesn't it  
yeah i think you're right they have ma  
the number of  
yeah  
durable  
i think  
i would <unk> i would go for four  
<unk> yeah sort out any bugs or whatever  
right  
mm 'kay  
okay  
two  
i mean we can probably on a machine with a few hundred megabyte ram you can go quite far  
this is yes right okay  
yeah  
i don't think we were making diffuse diffuse emission or  
end  
we'll we'll be on  
huh  
<unk> yes for the for the the position  
<unk>  
so you will have <unk> and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um <unk> a <unk> a clay remote control  
yeah okay true  
oops sorry  
for sound and channel  
yes but apart from that we don't really do anything different as if it was just one meeting  
okay  
yes the signs  
okay so  
i'll just um i'll grab the wire out the back of this one  
mm  
and uh d. l. l. et cetera  
mm  
okay  
it was twice as important as anything else  
yeah  
<unk>  
so we're <unk> uh before the presentation of the prototype  
yeah yeah  
well it could be a wee <unk> thing and something could come up on the screen  
mm-hmm  
okay  
i  
we had some problems going to twelve euros and uh i dunno  
and less functions would have to be included  
yeah it's oh we can save this  
so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve or two plus two is channel twenty two  
and then  
maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple but that's not what uh has been asked  
okay  
it was fifty mil fifty million  
big screen  
yeah  
so you know that immediately discounts exchange um structures that are mostly for information seeking alone because the notion exchange is to restrict it there  
yeah  
we had that um to dis include teletext um because it's become outdated and everybody uses the internet anyway  
yeah  
yeah but the components inside  
yeah they they emanate a light through it  
um user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching  
do your exercises while you're watching the t. v.  
yeah sorry about that matthew is still on the way  
and it's nice to get some feedback on i mean that feedback will probably come after your proposal possibly  
um because that's going to affect the kinds of relations that you get between the utterances  
it's  
uh you don't really need to <unk> like fiddle with threshold a lot so mm  
okay  
well yeah  
mm  
thank you  
yeah we will uh  
we need to use  
um i also <unk> uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the l. c. d. screen was uh rather small  
mm-hmm  
you can  
mm-hmm  
okay  
um they don't <unk> they will be starting a new project together if um if i'm not mistaken  
and have a <unk> you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of <unk> changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh  
by the length  
not as artistic as heather's drawing  
okay  
yeah  
say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work  
more cost effective  
no  
right  
if you if you s. s. h. and they have this big warning about doing nothing at all in the gateway machine  
mm-hmm  
okay so that's just a brief overview of the <unk> the the project itself  
thank you  
it it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things  
you have to think at at at at at at at database where there's lot of in links  
um  
what did they say  
um <unk> ma makes sense um  
mm-hmm  
look fancy  
yeah  
so have a scroll for volume  
it won't stand out  
so the elder yeah they wanted a little bit of wood in it and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now  
so you're next  
is it more natural than this  
is huh  
like this and to open it we have to attach it somewhere i dunno how to do that technically or  
i can show you uh  
so that would be the it's a major change but  
uh yeah okay shot nine currently shot ten probably  
yeah  
so i think we have to do some work to <unk> our idea and take decisions  
okay  
the next one  
what  
that was just we ran out of yellow  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
uh new blank  
run length encoding i'm out of here  
and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons  
it's not  
okay right welcome to meeting b.  
yep  
so uh yeah that's me  
the ability to locate it again  
yeah  
and uh  
several examples of uh styles so you can get a clear picture of uh what i mean  
hmm  
isn't it part of the of the <unk> no  
then we shall start with a presentation from raj  
can can can we have multiple designs  
mm-hmm  
magic man  
throughout  
mm-hmm  
and the for flipping up and down  
<unk> okay if you if you drop the cost now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale  
yeah  
no that's nothing  
see you later in half an hour  
okay cool  
but <unk> with question marks in between would have to be resolved in some way  
so one  
that's true  
uh-huh  
there are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear  
so twenty five euro you expect a quite well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control  
the design  
'kay and  
true  
not now no  
low <unk>  
um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down  
they don't look uh so there there is a very <unk> thing so if you press on the top it takes the one  
yes  
it's not really a stick but  
yeah this is true  
yeah  
here we go again  
uh on and off switch which must be clear with a red button or something like that  
yeah  
yeah i'd say so yeah  
but uh problem is well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can  
um so do we wanna go for that or do we want to go for an older demographic  
so we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes  
uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one so uh you you want to keep it simple  
um as a little training um i will ask <unk> first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected  
so i mean the colours are for young people but  
okay yeah  
um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little <unk> guy here um and then the volume controls are here and here  
i've no idea  
this is the name of the new directory you will create  
yeah  
how much time we want to spend again to get  
yeah  
<unk>  
read about yeah  
i think it's just for one  
mm-hmm  
i mean your report it's it should be described there or yeah yeah  
uh mm  
yeah  
i've uh i mean i'll try try to put in justification for for the change that i made uh on the page  
but that's that's very expensive uh  
yeah  
brilliant  
there's only a few buttons but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context  
uh if if we've got everything then i suppose it's you can always yes it's you're not throwing anything away then  
uh here information is a little vague  
three  
professor was interested to know when people were talking about him  
yeah  
i don't know whether that  
yeah but that's the <unk> uh almost i think similar to what i'm doing because words that are in every class  
because th th some some of these people that expert there are couple of experts so they learned itself  
okay  
alright  
uh  
yeah the deluxe  
hmm  
this is the most competing prototypes i've found  
it's not that fast  
i think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present yep  
so yeah  
we're the first  
well  
no i'm just try i'm trying to <unk> think of the things that could go wrong  
yeah  
you did work together didn't you  
yeah  
just 'cause it was looks the best the stripes orange  
yeah  
maybe that's a <unk> a special colour for it  
yeah  
so it's probably some value that you have to like divide by one uh one divide by the value of something  
mm  
no i'm just like sort of like preparing people for um it looks like it looks like really nothing  
we can have a good look at that  
so how much do they display and starting position at where the or maybe the mid position of it  
and so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit the chip that can compose messages  
because certainly i i have a hard time separating separating things completely  
yeah  
okay  
so did you enjoy your clay <unk>  
that's true  
yeah  
it's a kind of selection in this circle which i think is a really good idea  
well i've got like a few hours free  
it'll float  
uh no  
chatting and emailing  
then yes then i would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative  
well let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what because we have to reevaluate anyway  
even if it is you know it's very rounded but still you got some rubber fruit here  
okay  
but that just the appeal of of not having you know  
yeah  
um if we did decide to go for voice activation there <unk> should always be a button as alternative  
you just apply l. l. p. so auto correlation let's say or you can do power spectrum whatever  
uh kick off  
rubber  
yeah  
so that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that  
okay  
if i go to herve i can try and say we are in this situation apparently  
could open that anyway think  
so if you don't find anything  
yeah  
marketing  
yeah i thought about for deaf people for example so  
with a spongy bob feel  
hmm  
so you're saying that you're not sure if every yep is an agreement or  
but if it was on your t. v. you'd want to be able to use it if  
and in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white which is the predominant colour of the uh the windows badge  
right  
no uh we can't  
you know call i. m. two  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
'kay  
components open c. v.  
so we'll just if we can just <unk> what's in here we've got this it's a solar cell thing right  
did you find anything new  
oh  
we have to  
<unk> because i i was writing it down in the last uh <unk>  
it could be something like  
next  
you can't really see that picture well but there's various different remotes once again with lots of different buttons on making it more complicated  
uh no i don't  
those shouldn't be there should they  
mm yeah  
mm-hmm  
do you need this or just write on the white board  
what  
yeah  
yeah i think so yeah  
mm-hmm  
and the shapes that the they've been going  
um we gonna do the evaluation now together  
instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button  
congratulations  
you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and <unk> stagger the release of them and get people like oh i want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money  
uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the <unk> material  
oh this were ho how it started basically because that was uh <unk> <unk> yeah and dan ellis  
but when you are left handed that's that's a problem  
yeah  
yeah  
then it pops up pop up screen came  
uh on a functional side of things we found out that <unk> from our previous meeting  
and then doing some compression and computation of yeah yeah yeah <unk> oh yeah  
excellent  
mm-hmm  
and then we'd have  
maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors  
i don't have a red colour  
yeah  
uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home  
okay  
so uh it wasn't perfect  
every cover  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
um so  
yeah  
uh but but yeah the it it but it just seems a little suspect  
even though it should be meaningless because we're all part of a school i think that it does actually make a difference  
no problem it's it's okay that's yeah go ahead  
um so i think that will work well with regards to our market  
yeah right  
um at three i think  
okay  
yeah right  
yeah  
as well as the l. c. d. screen  
um sure  
it's <unk> fantastic  
so six point five  
else my animal will be like king size  
um subjects you're gonna have <unk>  
traps i know  
uh before we begin it i want to say i've i've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder  
i think yeah yeah definitely  
and for that fire wire is good  
but hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive  
we don't have to  
and every frame is stored into uh a <unk> a backup in fact every frame um it's m. m. m. who manage this automatically  
only with uh extension you can you can see  
mm okay  
that's alright  
oops  
but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band width  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i think it's  
instead of fruits and vegetables just if you look at it straightforward it's a bit yeah  
right  
i think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the v. c. r. to start recording at three p. m. or whatever  
yep  
yeah  
it's inconsistent with the damped lyman alpha at more than the ninety nine percent  
yeah  
but it it's might be okay so  
again i don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet  
well what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels  
a dialogue act uh a dialogue act annotations of dialogue act  
uh and uh and from there it would <unk> yeah  
you see a pen here  
that's just my opinion  
i do know so  
i mean <unk>  
neutral hydrogen <unk> petersen absorption  
oh  
okay  
hmm  
mm mm mm mm mm  
this is the one i i had seen yeah  
mm-hmm  
yep  
<unk> we <unk> we don't we don't have uh that <unk>  
and then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations  
the time delay is is very small  
sort of  
but an argument that is the group view  
mm-hmm  
do we have to demonstrate something next week  
yeah  
so  
mm  
okay  
oh still yeah  
yeah  
um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros  
'cause yeah we want clear thinking  
so we don't yeah we also have to  
or  
yeah true yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yes it is  
so this is for the uh dialogue part  
or just give a beep when the <unk> out or uh down  
you know that was collected <unk> a little bit like this without uh too much care  
mine i'll need to make a minor addition to the data manager and the <unk>  
and that means <unk> that means you get to bump that bit to the t. v. maker so  
and we also want to look at our remote control so  
that's me  
okay  
and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company  
is it possible uh i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours  
participant two  
we have two <unk> in our department  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
and so they didn't annotate the <unk> <unk> uh uh the spaces and everything would mess up  
but it's just an idea  
uh-huh  
okay  
yeah mm-hmm  
so <unk> you you just  
so we well sorry we could maybe even go as far as saying power button small joystick l. c. d.  
that's true  
oh yeah well yeah we had <unk> some red left over  
'cause each utterance has got an i. d. associated with it  
well that's true yeah you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever that that makes sense  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light  
yeah okay  
yeah  
just thinking what's the <unk> so  
you mean with this phase uh sure  
yeah just as a fun way to find it  
so a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model  
i guess so yeah  
okay  
he he was saying that there is something really really uh simple the decoder i mean not the features but he was mentioning something to the decoder  
skip it  
um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote  
and um for the longer utterances i just um look how often um one of these words is in there and simply add it up  
we'll  
which include you know um space craft coffee makers and bullet trains  
i think we maybe should  
yeah  
no i'm doing the interface  
well if if it's not chip on print then i guess you get different chip components and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra red  
okay  
hi  
it's an admonishment  
but that's also in the l. c. d. right  
and when the battery doesn't work i usually shake it too  
ah that's not the ecological part yeah  
and like response from consumers  
mm mm  
mm  
it works the same as a nokia telephone it's it's in my uh 'kay  
yes this was uh the last m. s.  
yeah  
mm  
uh did it say a price also uh for for uh <unk> uh l. c. d. or uh coloured l. c. d.  
okay  
uh  
yeah i don't know  
okay  
one is fancy look second is  
um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale so one is you know yes  
i'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work  
yeah yeah  
yeah yeah i suppose nearer to you but a <unk> like if you have surround sound then  
hmm  
yeah  
okay three  
so are you saying have say three sessions in a row and then do that twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon  
yeah  
uh-huh  
'kay um  
put it in project documents yeah  
and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you  
um unfortunately i wasn't given too much information  
the okay  
no  
just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping  
okay  
true  
<unk> yeah you know two  
how does it look like or sure  
okay  
well you can if you had uh something li  
no no no no it's fine i'm just preparing  
you don't say here's green rubber  
i guess you could say where there's  
yeah i don't think you can  
mm-hmm  
mm  
i've got a touch pad  
and then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um  
well  
yeah there the middle  
okay and  
and your role is  
these are new ideas we and new shapes everything  
um i wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet  
no  
yeah  
then you can do it  
and it detects okay  
before before <unk> before ending the meeting i'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future <unk> prototype  
mm-hmm  
um this is it  
yes  
is there a schedule for this meeting  
there you go  
anyway nah  
i think  
you have to say that 'cause i'm taking the notes  
but i say frank but i want everybody to compute like marius  
mm-hmm  
so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing they they don't care about the buttons any more  
hmm  
okay  
<unk>  
yeah they again give the phase  
so i mean if you wanted to transmit with fewer bands you'd maybe still keep the lower bands or or maybe you could still transmit the pitch  
okay  
no  
um i think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic  
uh unfortunately the on one machine  
so push button then it's it's the next expensive one  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm  
twenty one  
um okay here's some ideas for you  
um there is there is just one other thing she she typed okay um in caps  
yeah  
but i wanted to make sure that we sort of all aligned on what he was doing at the moment and and then sort of figured out how to give him the best advice coming up  
well mostly skimming yeah  
just every every once in a while  
so you  
i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said  
i had a problem i like find the answer for my own  
mm  
but yeah  
a simple chip is required to operate push buttons  
fifteen to <unk>  
from  
i mean i mean people uh i suppose at h. u. v. there are some people uh where i was in le mans in the u. b. uh i mean there uh would be obviously some some students uh that would be aware of and that could be able to handle this  
yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next yeah  
ma maybe maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh  
so we're going to do something and uh uh so could you do something or this kind of uh action related utterance i mean  
then we're going to evaluate the product and i think the whole production process and then we're gonna close it up and we have forty minutes so  
and you and so when you say the eye was on this from here to here what's gonna happen is that is that if you use the real frame rate  
okay that's  
no you press the plus first  
what's that  
um i haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there um but there's some curved cases that you can see uh a range of sizes uh  
sounds nice  
okay  
mm  
uh and especially for this kind of problem i think it can be a much more useful kind of data because there is real presentations  
you can see we're we're all very far beyond the  
yep  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay so it's not necessarily phase but if you're using some sort of sinusoidal coding it's phase yeah  
uh uh i make a tick here and i clean up this is just to to solve that pro that problem regarding the slide and the slide resolution  
oh okay  
hmm  
six  
okay so we want um for our target group would we say  
effort is three ten and twelve  
play doh  
so we have to use material that is already available  
um okay i mean you could  
okay yeah  
okay um  
and that's pretty much it  
and um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary  
okay  
okay  
yeah more or less  
and what's the menu button  
so we have to be able to deliver those two things and they're rather different demands  
big mm-hmm  
that it actually works  
yes  
that's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object  
the all the windows uh uh pro programming  
yeah  
seems  
yeah i think  
okay it's independent of each other  
but  
but you can prune like how much you want because  
uh  
yeah  
or <unk> or do we just integrate an an an scroll wheel with a push button  
lovely  
i've haven't i've never seen a locking functionality  
well it's just you don't want it plugged in really <unk>  
i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh <unk> kate cat cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people  
um so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us cost the company um 'cause it sounds very labour intensive  
we you have to put it to the customers  
yeah but but when you when it gets lost how can you press the button to make it  
and then they go like oh i can choose the colour wow  
you're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have and just make it a little distinct  
probably  
<unk>  
three feet huge l. c. d. dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that  
it's  
yeah  
no  
'kay yep that's you  
okay well any more ideas  
yeah uh something like this would be nice  
now um  
so  
yeah  
users think they're ugly  
mm  
to communicate and to well learn from each other's plans uh as i can say um so <unk>  
no problem  
we only have twos  
so had we known  
um  
uh what are needed to complete insulation process 'cause you know  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> nothing no costs at all  
come on  
so so mine's a bit pointless  
so i i got that in email form  
let's see  
uh with a little bit larger yeah  
no  
<unk>  
you're you are having <unk> there right  
like it it it has to work on on on the word like on  
could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off  
so i i think that's okay  
how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button  
that was the last one  
uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing and and some fruit and colours i dunno  
yeah  
that i don't know  
no problem no problem  
and they are possible  
to <unk> because th th th the the selling price is already <unk> <unk> uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros  
it's good they're not charging anything for that  
mm-hmm  
we'll see  
yeah yeah you have a fancy design then right away  
yeah  
a face  
yeah i suppose you could calculate them off line and just yeah have a like like a <unk> little thumbnail or something  
yeah  
because you know your fixation is a point  
alright now we know what to do so  
or whether i just talk to craig  
okay  
you'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop and then uh you uh  
we have to get these buttons dave  
yeah  
six  
okay  
fact they've got black and white or black and silver  
that's uh the motto of our company  
right right  
<unk> mm-hmm  
i think  
okay so try to find that for next meeting  
yeah  
also the people are worried about about the r. s. i. disease which is if you repeat the <unk> the same movement  
yeah  
peace out nigger  
okay  
oh i will create desire  
just because it's it's gonna look stupid if we have everything working but just if  
yeah <unk> yeah yeah  
we could do it with the chip yes  
yeah something or uh <unk> special way to to zap through the it has to <unk> it has to be yeah and quick  
so they're they're at the moment so  
or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well  
oh okay  
it's not your traditional yeah  
and uh then also the simple versus advanced  
oops  
you could provide that option  
and uh that's it so i won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components  
yeah  
yeah  
you know if i  
go on draw something  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah then you know put your mind at rest  
uh  
okay  
good point  
yeah  
that should be interesting  
um actually um you could you could think of um having <unk> a <unk> you can have a key which could tell <unk> it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v. c. r. option and you could play it or you can also think about having like um  
mm  
um i think that that has some impact on on on many things  
hmm  
yeah  
the then <unk> no  
not that pen  
and so yo you're kind of feeling a v. like volume up  
this one  
okay  
innovative and third is easy to use  
that's the problem  
yeah  
i think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project  
so basically uh what i've just found out from the board i dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only  
yeah it's almost the same concept but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner  
mm-hmm  
yeah but we don't we don't have any costs now so yeah  
this is the problem but  
yeah and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live t. v. and things like that  
so  
okay the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour  
well the <unk> the most important function is easy to use  
um i feel i got my say  
or does it flip all the way  
okay  
okay  
but what what did what do <unk> sorry but what do they mean with the curves  
um what else uh so don't need to worry about teletext don't need to worry about v. c. r.  
and  
yeah  
janus can you uh  
so thank you  
well uh we managed but we did it very quickly  
just have to be big enough for the biggest  
or find a compromise maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it on your <unk>  
it's from my uh research  
wait is that like your  
no not not fronts but different designs  
i mean  
so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here  
right  
yeah what i also did was having two people um annotate the first meeting  
yeah  
great  
created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder  
it's simply that it hasn't been um <unk> it or or segmented in a way that's typical of speech resources  
<unk> do you have any other  
i'd say we finish this one up we get started i'll get in  
boring  
push button  
right  
something uh  
for example uh there what i also did was uh a simple peak peaking algorithm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
<unk> maybe two  
yeah  
but for the a. s. r. system uh i'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or  
no  
and did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand is it gonna be a single or a double  
you know like setting down what the constraints are on the analysis game  
okay  
yeah but that's the point of the data manager is to manage all that  
you have more  
yes i think you are  
no problem  
so you've got the gaze position of the first person gaze position of the second mouse position of the first  
okay  
how long would it take to make the frequency counts with a java hash table  
okay  
right  
sure  
and a display so i press it so the display says okay i'm in t. v. or d. v. d. or whatever it is  
because it has to be uh there all the time you know  
well the whole idea then is that then you start playing with it right  
yeah  
<unk> that was a nice meeting  
sorry <unk> did you want to say anything  
so we have the choice between rubber and plastic  
yeah but it is uh it it is a new feature it is something special  
yeah  
exactly  
mm  
'kay  
technologically innovative and this fancy new i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now  
i think you can't miss it  
yeah  
direct uh communication with yeah  
mm  
it's gonna be curved  
if if you look if if this this is thick and this is thin th th then it that it lies over your hands  
yes  
yeah sure  
mm  
this is what what this is very related to what frank did with the with the keyword uh image annotation  
is she responsible for sending that information so late  
mm  
is that somewhere here  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so we <unk> should kill it  
the smart controller  
<unk> okay  
so  
but do we have enough <unk> enough data for that it gives us sensible things  
the other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time  
but with all of these other features i think people <unk> one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice  
it's an electrical circuit  
mm  
'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu  
the smaller your web crawl the less small world network like it's gonna be  
yeah  
no sure but but  
mm-hmm  
okay but i don't know if it uh is still correctly uh  
are are what maybe what is the size of the battery  
and uh after you can see that indeed because it's a long shot and it's almost like a flat plane  
so so you can you can do it in x. fig export them as s. v. g. and you just get a you just get a list of x. y. coordinates  
can you click on a point in time in display and jump to there yet  
<unk> do you want me to hold it  
um a two part remote which was what were were originally looking at  
right i haven't gotten any yeah any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery  
absorption  
mm-hmm  
yeah from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative  
uh i did mis group  
like a process uh  
while you have to agree i can say it's like this and you must agree  
<unk> is it is it is it <unk> is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some  
so gyro to n. and then like  
but actually because you know the numbers and the study is not <unk> i it's not showing uh strong results  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah this that's that's very good  
i mean based on our <unk> studies again um <unk> um people said that the power button was <unk> a very relevant button  
feature  
so i think i i missed the budget thing it was fifty million euros  
<unk> yeah  
yeah i think it's <unk> well one um um how could we do it  
and then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work  
mm-hmm  
so this is frequency  
'cause that uh what it type of yeah for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like  
but  
uh if uh i'm i guess that if they're different then we might just uh write another script to do the translation  
the interesting thing is that because it's structure of this it isn't enough to just say well if you don't have a sound card you don't have sound  
yeah yeah  
uh so they are pretty boring i suggest because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours  
yeah <unk> distance etcetera  
and and you get whispering type synthesis yeah  
but why don't we just provide some means  
yeah  
i <unk> i won't  
and that's it  
so uh  
that's what i was doing the end of last week um just so i know how it all works and figuring out the best way to do things  
what however you pick it out  
okay  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
because we we use a brand at the front and uh i dun at the back  
mm  
i'm sorry i didn't really get the point of comparing the pitch the pitch is the is the frequency that is okay  
i mean i was mention the the lapel microphone mm just like this  
but you're gonna ha i reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days  
well it can be whatever you want  
well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um  
mm  
so do  
um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty five euro and our profit aim is fifty million euro  
yeah  
we do have the minimum am amount i mean we were talking finances i dunno selling a a forty pound remote would <unk> or a forty dollar remote  
what are we gonna build that thing out of  
before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like i've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions  
yep  
three  
it's kinda frustrating but um  
no  
that we think about shape materials and themes or series that go throughout  
okay  
colour  
or maybe he's using excel to do a demonstration or something like this and we'll want to avoid this  
right  
an  
or your girlfriend didn't change your mind  
uh hmm  
um i <unk> i had an idea single covered uh curved sorry single curved  
the speeches from anywhere  
okay  
yeah and then you can show it to everybody  
yeah  
alright yeah  
there we go  
okay requirements  
yeah but that's not what's meant here i think  
yeah  
yeah  
each of us is going  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so you gonna clear or <unk> however you do this with ellen right  
it'll follow you if you  
okay so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a <unk> um  
so only <unk> right handed  
ma maybe there's some merit of going altogether for utterance level and not even bother to calculate i mean if you have to do it internally  
now i'm not saying we should have you know tomato shaped remote controls or anything  
yep  
we have a kin uh kinetic provision then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy  
so maybe that's an idea i don't know  
and how simple complex it should be  
yeah even if it's just a you know on a <unk> the um the references and then why they're relevant right  
oh yeah its its <unk> its fruit fruit shape  
that's the end of my presentation  
yeah  
um but once <unk>  
for sure you know that's and <unk> or well <unk> is not necessarily intentional  
market  
yeah you see the email  
<unk> which is the led the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the no to the set  
so 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five euro a piece  
i think that's that's one way to go yes  
it's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly <unk> that it's a real reaction i product  
a rechargeable maybe  
let's hear what kate has to say  
and for us to figure out what help he needs with that  
um and i'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible  
yeah  
so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings  
um i see that you target uh several <unk> application not only t. v. but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control  
yeah but i don't i don't know if it's very <unk> yeah  
um  
but at least the mass of the work will be done by someone else that can spend a hundred percent of time on that  
something like that  
hmm  
and i wanted to um to look at the strategy  
totally  
mm-hmm  
that  
no  
the first uh on each item  
two 'kay  
<unk> so so you activate the menu  
and then you can count them together  
okay  
touch screen yeah then it's turn turn off turn on  
so <unk> show what else  
i see  
and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium  
technologically it should be like um work basically i guess  
<unk> you want to  
they're kind of it looks they're the idea i've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there  
se  
like we have then you know like it's only for only close uh d. c. l. k. c. l. they have  
okay  
do we take to have uh somebody uh for contract even if it's not an intern but take somebody for six months to work on this  
so of course this uh p. l. s. a. completely separated those out into into categories  
i well it will be alright  
okay that's pretty good i think  
so let's remove it  
yeah i think these are the most important criteria  
there's no problem but i if you want your your system to work in different conditions like cafeteria library  
because if we make it grey or or silvery looking it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger  
yeah  
okay  
mm that should be oh wait is that <unk> that's an observatory isn't it  
yeah whatever  
and then yeah th those are few per meeting and it um well  
and which ever area <unk> has the greatest overlap is what they're actually looking at  
well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said  
uh here again that's my story about the different modes if you do want to make remote uh universal  
sure  
it <unk> it <unk> yeah  
oh shit  
well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the t. v. you can uh well write a code or choose a category  
you know to manipulate that to <unk> be a cover that you can pull off and  
we must have that  
so uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we <unk> we don't have any access to the to the t. v. design or we can change some design  
um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer or something like <unk> from the bottom of it  
not not so much an atmosphere the atmosphere is very relaxed  
any any thoughts about buttons or any <unk> other way of approaching the <unk> the uh the problem  
function f. eight  
oh  
you really only need robin right to to specify the rest  
oh  
mm  
um yes  
yes  
so let's just return to this question of frame rate  
ah  
yes  
pa  
so i found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you  
mm  
oh  
oh great  
in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um i think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper  
yeah so that you don't replace the symbol yeah  
it's it's a it's a sort of lump target  
no it's a choice  
so maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off  
yeah  
uh  
or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote  
but yet no one really understands them the actual x. m. l. parsing  
well when i say hopefully we have to  
that's a good one  
let's do the feature extraction that we have already taken then the back end for that  
mm-hmm  
well uh i think it's nice for one thing  
mm  
okay  
well we don't have the video orders  
so i th yeah and expense and the time  
okay  
but this is the yeah this is the hypothesis between this uh in this p. l. s. a. with link stuff  
yeah  
so um if we want something strong and sturdy i say stay with plastic or titanium but if we go with spongy  
okay  
but uh after i mean at this point we do we have nothing we can do unless they know what they want to do with it right  
so it is yeah  
yeah  
okay  
no  
yeah  
i think it's okay  
okay single curved case  
um i have something in my email about from joe  
it was it was more like oh it was more like you know  
yeah  
it's gonna be how to display it and all that sort of stuff  
<unk>  
<unk> we can uh override them  
yeah  
yeah  
filth between the mobile  
so  
i do think we have to put that underneath a clip  
they cannot work with double curved  
this is our  
no yeah but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah  
yeah  
that's a good question  
deltas  
okay  
banana  
i think  
ah but  
grand  
mm mm mm  
so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote it could be like pear <unk> yeah  
so i mean uh i do think you should keep in mind what the final goal is so that you can plug this into something at the end and and um show some benefit of having the mark up  
yeah  
thank you for that description <unk>  
wait but is that separate from what he was saying  
channel yeah  
yes  
the the board  
if someone uh has an uh some noise with uh perhaps putting his uh his cap on the on the table  
yeah obvious  
it could be fun  
because the display at the moment does take  
oh yeah and power  
um good well designed buttons intuitive buttons  
if the speaker is actually talking about what is in the slides or not  
well that's it i mean  
i think uh we we may have to like it can have a uh it's it's kind of like uh uh maybe take like uh uh two or three days  
when you want to have <unk> or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it  
mm-hmm  
and if you want to make to <unk> twenty five you push on this  
it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave  
e. uh e. t. s. a. i. yeah  
ah we're back to damped lyman alpha data  
yeah just split it up somehow yeah  
fantastic  
alright the agenda for <unk> oh  
then the graphical card uh for the t. f. t. and the third unit is the i. r.  
mm-hmm  
well i'm gonna paint in the red  
mm-hmm  
i mean if you can't control the the sound settings i mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something you you need to change that  
that is possible too  
thank you  
let's make it uh black  
we'll get panned on the next one anyway  
yeah  
you th okay  
yeah i know it from the cell phone  
yep  
f. five  
so the reason why the summary didn't work well in the last one and works well now is because based on the bottom data the data is so <unk> high in its imp importance rating that it just sort of then  
indeed  
sorry that doesn't look anything like what you had there  
if if you touch options you can't go back to this uh right away now  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
but <unk> <unk>  
three  
yeah a button yeah i guess so  
but  
uh so when i looked at the the word <unk> there were two topics  
'cause like we could make that not even have like a a real sort of meaning just put like max and min  
so i think we should skip the titanium uh stuff and we should uh use wood or something like that  
oh  
well it isn't on the desktop  
mm well i can prepare <unk> sorry  
oh that pen drawings  
and um how do people use it  
and  
uh jim <unk> student  
but how we do it  
hmm  
for the search results i probably think that instead of a <unk> a simple summary  
meeting's over  
yeah  
sorry for the functional recurrence  
about um the components uh just the hardware  
they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing  
yeah thank you  
mm-hmm  
and then on the right we have what's really big trend right now it's the ipod  
yeah  
then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh  
yeah maybe  
and you can't erase this  
and does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal  
um  
uh mine's gonna be mostly using the off line  
then we try to see what works better right  
so what do you guys think about the first idea is just very short  
i i i'd prefer to go back to the c. t. s. models i think as well 'cause i think i think they did work a little bit better  
that then the individual chunks of the individual meetings whereas and then you can click on a meeting  
okay  
op <unk> and then that gets sent to the uh to the l. e. d. light  
it sounds something that you'd use on <unk>  
how <unk> how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units <unk> no one hundred thousand units  
for both  
they're  
if <unk>  
and l. c. d. was a possibility for the remote control  
what about the ca yeah  
well originally i thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple  
it's just  
in fact it wouldn't really cost anymore would it  
that's fine  
uh i like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now  
yeah i like it i like the idea that's good  
stands out  
you can i yeah  
so uh i'm guessing that uh uh i notice on the bottom there it's got uh  
so it's not necessarily restarting the sentence but just a restart of any type  
uh  
okay  
the  
yeah  
very nice  
for future um meetings you have got  
well <unk> uh well <unk> me neither  
because <unk> some measure of alignment is looking where the other guy is directing attention  
uh i didn't get any info on this  
it isn't the case if you want to see if uh i mean what if seen in the meeting and that okay  
that's right  
that's uh that's  
no i do not wanna change my password  
so <unk> as um anna has said that this <unk> people are interested in things which are you don't need to <unk> press the keys  
so what i did then was try this on a big database of web pages  
mm-hmm  
nah that's  
but uh  
yeah okay  
yeah  
uh or the direction we were going in at least  
oh there is a button missing  
uh yeah  
okay  
i do  
uh <unk> <unk> i think i think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible  
i i think that i have mm mm i think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user <unk> press a button to choose the channel for example  
yeah  
mm  
right okay but are what i mean is you <unk> wanna make sure you get the argumentative relations however you do it  
yeah  
mm  
you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product  
yeah okay that's true that's true  
we could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up  
yeah  
um then we have this electronic white board system  
i'll come to that later  
uh is some kind of d. c. t. or again yeah  
we have uh  
but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the  
now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale  
yes  
okay  
<unk> notes mm  
part  
yeah  
uh you were finding out about teletext  
yeah  
uh and <unk> the key  
so i could make it <unk> easy  
and  
we decided to use a single touch screen  
sort of up down kind of button but the volume control could double for that for example  
uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us  
rotated so it can  
okay  
the most important by far was the look and feel of it  
maybe a t. v. guide or something in your l. c. d. uh  
you could put  
so uh  
do they want but they want a rechargeable one  
we can spare at buttons over there  
i don't know  
wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like  
but if you <unk> now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen  
yeah  
well you already feel that uh pretty much i think  
we still have the fruit and vegetable print  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
if if you're mm if i if the if the <unk> if the if the encoding <unk> two kilo bits per second for the the excitation component of the signal  
so um that doesn't improve the use of the <unk> product so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand  
mm  
so it de  
yeah i guess  
you don't know  
wow we're doing really well  
shall i just turn it round for time  
alright  
yeah so it means  
didn't think so  
the base station  
just before you start to make it easier would you three mind emailing me your presentations  
i'm using those gaussian filters or classical those those <unk> <unk> like in uh m. f. c. c. <unk> right  
basically you can see <unk> sort of there in the middle with the fax machine and maggie and susan  
yeah i think it's cool  
if there's um even though there's not a word i think in the audio there will be something at that point because it has a duration  
yeah for now i mean really just like  
like doing a spongy layer of the banana and you open it  
so but shall i move away first or shall i stay here with we need to  
um but um so so at this stage  
yeah but some materials <unk> they're to be  
we don't have a way of usefully evaluating automatically what's good and what's bad  
yeah  
so we'll on once yeah  
no i think we are uh ready  
uh or  
it's it's a bad idea so  
and that i think could work  
no  
right  
yeah  
or did no <unk> no noise in fact i think is probably uh yes  
that's <unk> i mean an an absolute length is sort of a bit strange because that means that some utterances will not be changed in length  
not really  
right 'kay  
that's a good idea  
oh  
yeah it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind  
two point one seven out of seven  
yes  
yes fifty million is our aim to a profit so  
yeah  
oh i don't have anything right now  
you got a different uh  
okay  
yeah yeah  
i wanna see a  
but uh you know let them let them say they've got a problem before you um spend time trying to figure out what'll do it  
but you were thinking about making it smaller yeah  
so in that way we need not to <unk> have different different shape mobiles everything we will just design casings fruit shape  
meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there and if we found any new ideas  
yeah  
um cord  
so maybe an an <unk> fruit or <unk> fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a  
what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not  
yeah  
so i would i mean i would just  
so  
but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and  
yeah  
we  
see i'm a big music fan i don't know if you guys are i'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but  
well <unk> <unk> not not on the front side i think  
okay  
uh-huh  
any other thoughts come to mind  
about the voice recognition  
um i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas  
yeah  
or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh  
yeah  
mm absorption  
mm-hmm  
the <unk>  
uh no they're uh they're a little bit more expensive but by uh um um making  
<unk>  
but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that or a kiwi fruit  
does it  
yeah <unk> um <unk>  
um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes so  
what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium  
it's it's  
have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that i think we all agree is you know the best fit  
first we have to make a functional design  
it's already saved i think  
so <unk> we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here  
okay  
save  
and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use  
okay <unk> good  
and it has to be very strong because of the  
so i think before talking about the other thing it's important thing it's the case  
is it called p. c. m.  
it's easy to build  
uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff like  
no this is a standard colour  
ah okay  
<unk> yeah  
yeah just look at the possibilities then because if apparently it's what people want  
but you could actually go like uh something like this  
i just uh thought i'd pick the easiest one  
the inside is hard  
i'm not sure if that's like  
then that overlap means they're looking at the two pieces simultaneously  
so it's just  
um  
well nice to have uh options at least  
so would we like this or would we like the  
'kay so we'll produce a version of this which opens up with a dialogue box um where you can select a file  
yeah i know  
okay  
cheers  
and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and  
so we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion  
i i think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential  
and then you do multiples of right  
but now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera  
themed remote  
mm-hmm  
or or at the corners edges just the edges covered by rubber or something like that  
well yeah the  
mm-hmm  
okay  
the sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that  
so  
oh  
kick it out  
um i thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up  
here i present another version without the l. c. d.  
and like to see it all come together  
i think maybe a two  
well yeah  
so  
scaling factor language scaling factor and inversion penalty  
all read them  
by  
yeah what's is really  
good  
uh-huh  
okay  
no i don't need l. p. c.  
right  
yeah you can't really get any other output  
whether it's a battery it could be something really  
mm  
oh  
uh what do you mean by supplements exactly  
yeah  
yeah  
didn't have a look at our meetings  
or  
very important for the design  
well  
talk to caroline  
what our ideas where  
uh important is that we use different colours and uh different pen widths  
but given that um <unk> technological innovation is important then we need to i'll say it again technologically innovate  
right  
university of east anglia  
that's fine  
like on the shelf  
um i don't know this person  
mm-hmm  
like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four  
there's quite a lot of like dolby surround studio surround sort of things  
yeah  
yep  
we will have again three presentation from all of you and uh i hope it will be fast because i would like to have time to  
ooh  
no anyway so we okay so we'll finish this call routing stuff  
but otherwise we go ahead and dump 'em  
and and and this too  
mm-hmm  
helium  
okay  
it has to be of course a very slim and small one  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
that kind of annoys me though when it's zero six when you have to press i don't know why  
no but  
if we look back and not uh look at only remote controls i think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in <unk> in <unk> big cities like paris and milan  
i think that there's no contradiction here because if there are few buttons  
yeah  
yeah we're we're ahead of the game there  
and that would be uh a considerable problem  
i think they are  
indeed  
so if you find that the player accepts some <unk> input from memory and if it's easy to do then i guess that's that's fairly doable  
that's me  
okay  
yeah the like yeah  
banana <unk> r. c.  
mm  
can you zoom in a t. v.  
yeah we want  
usually audio audio and video should be synchronized  
the only other slight complication is um which will be <unk> i think brought up at the meeting on thursday for all the eye tracking users  
yeah  
yeah just three desks yeah  
you could <unk> <unk> on a mobile phone these days  
but otherwise i mean i didn't find any anything important with the phase  
yeah some people are  
yeah  
um  
okay uh first what is a remote control  
but yeah stick with the same kind of kinda yeah the same basic non remote kind of remote design  
okay  
well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement  
hmm  
i think it's it's functional it's also pretty basic so i'll give it a two  
that's sort of curve in and out  
but the problem is aurora again these models are word based models no  
so yeah so that's one possible way of doing that  
mm  
yeah that would be best yeah  
no problem  
okay but we have to rate uh these things now  
wait  
mm-hmm  
so if we want to put a <unk> or someone who just comes in for short period of time  
so you has to be a a reasonable target uh for the for the tracking purposes  
yeah  
mm  
mm mm  
so maybe a good idea would be to listen to each channel one by one do listen to the silent and non silent regions and make all those corrections  
trend watching i guess  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
i'd say the integrated  
uh i was working on a <unk> yeah on a schedule and i was supposed to do it like this  
but  
i think this is roughly it off hand  
anyway sorry  
well i think most definitely  
two  
right  
yep  
okay  
you can split it and say uh all these parts belong to person one here  
right  
and the other point i haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design  
finance  
some things that sort of relevant to what i wanna say  
the scale  
oh yeah  
or is the <unk>  
but  
'kay yeah thanks  
oh so am i  
will come in handy  
curve  
yeah  
fit in your hand yeah  
channel settings  
so  
'cause it's it's really what people want  
if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control yeah  
yeah well some of these uh yeah  
that's also short catchy  
uh  
<unk> uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control  
hmm  
um okay  
we're very ambitious on this one  
well i don't know how to do it in java  
huh  
and and the engine is is in the festival itself  
uh yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
i i in terms of <unk> i i think the the two front runners are the standard battery or the kinetic  
oh no no  
so the colour is yellow  
but we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the project manager  
okay  
i really think as <unk> much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design  
yeah  
yeah but <unk>  
yeah yeah  
it was supposed to be another tree bank  
or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough right  
mm-hmm  
so  
you can control any logic like that <unk> rather than doing it by hand and setting it in stone for all time  
yeah  
almost  
okay  
i mean there was fruits yeah  
and um uh matthew yeah  
oh ebenezer <unk>  
people  
line and  
yeah  
the  
yeah well it does look like a nuclear bomb  
like it's not in time domain  
yeah first this is proposed by like uh even we read one paper in our reading group you remember that  
but it could be it could be fine i mean running over the data twice probably is okay  
i'm person two  
just remember when i made up this report i didn't have the information that we're discussing here  
exactly yeah  
no i think this is a good idea  
i haven't got an idea on on which we need to use really  
but a different animal with a different colour and a different line width  
well but also about the displays i mean the displays in the in the text body  
mm  
but basically yeah maybe i can continue with my presentation it would be al you you but i think we have some technical problem or so  
uh i can get all the raw text but it has to be ordered still  
they don't have to be all the same  
elderly people like au colours which <unk> are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown red deep reds and stuff  
and before i <unk> forget it uh i have one question  
alright  
yeah  
but only sometimes like it can't really call this yeah  
no i know  
yeah  
okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three euros  
yep  
and it's also good if talks are on the same topic for a whole morning or a whole afternoon because then people will come along and go oh  
a real high tech version of it  
the battery there are few options  
so you at the moment you have got a threshold and everything that's above it is displayed  
i'm waiting to know  
on for true and seven for <unk>  
input  
so they have a <unk> between two slaves which is done by the master  
so  
yeah  
no  
yep  
oh there we go  
this is very ugly  
virtual  
and everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have  
mm yeah okay so that would be the option  
uh it <unk> i'd just have to hear it  
so even though it's a single button but it is pretty <unk> flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement  
okay  
well you can you can double curve if you don't have titanium  
i'm just <unk> i talking about some something to make this thing unique  
yeah that yeah  
well i started i started with the first phase i think was the functional  
yeah  
um that would make  
yes  
have to say ha ha  
yeah example of crappy <unk>  
um yeah  
yep  
sorry  
'kay double click it  
well <unk> you you can if you want to  
because infra red is something which everybody has  
um i had some things sent to me  
thank you  
yes three  
no  
so i got the participant uh  
oh yeah yeah  
uh the <unk>  
uh what are your experiences with remote controls  
i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research so you know i'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here  
yes  
mm  
i don't even have this on  
sure  
i mean i'm sure they're not on the web yet  
i'll just go back  
but um  
okay  
does it need with a square thing <unk>  
desktop  
i mean i know sinclair and coulthard is is basically about teaching yeah  
yeah i think  
yeah  
uh  
okay what do you <unk> oh i'm sorry  
mm-hmm  
so you do the looking around at other remote controls  
okay  
contradicting kind of shapes  
right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there yep  
yeah sorry for topic segments i have  
yeah but check it out  
so it's easier to it all back all those labels and everything yeah  
maybe li like that  
because the t. v. has to send information back to the r. c. and i don't know if that's possible  
no that's true  
so we need up down and side to side buttons  
uh the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine  
uh it lost it off here  
well  
yeah it's not really an open domain task yeah  
i'm sure it has its own buttons so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote  
yeah  
uh i thought for the side view that the <unk> the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle  
uh just a few buttons trendy design nice lightning effects <unk> and the sound  
yep  
is a lot of t. v. <unk> won't re the t. v. <unk> won't respond exactly the same  
okay let's do that  
mm-hmm  
i dunno  
yes  
um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here  
that's right  
uh  
yeah you'd you'd say line wings  
oh yeah that's a good one that  
instead of <unk>  
there's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much  
yeah anything to do with what you hear right  
when you uh press one button you give one signal  
well any other uh  
instead of a list what about putting it in the display  
so keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations i think this should be the solution for them  
mm  
so you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons  
yeah that's improved uh pretty much  
but maybe you are using twenty nine that's for you it's different but one more  
yeah that that's a better question actually  
this  
and let's like see if we get anything else  
yeah  
under stimulated on the whole thing  
um going to my personal preferences  
okay  
is it does it need to be uh decided on now  
it has to be original trendy and user friendly  
underneath there's actually one button underneath it's just that the panel itself is a single panel  
yeah really  
so agnes with marianne and david  
so we don't need  
but you can give it any colour uh which is the same for rubber but it's not slippery  
i thought it  
okay  
nah i'm i'm not convinced of that at all  
no no the battery has fallen down that's i  
yeah  
because i think um the video is done the video compression is done on the on that card and uh i'm not hundred percent sure  
marketing  
okay  
oh that was quick  
i mean like one to <unk> thirty of or ninety or whatever  
and we and we have a single curved uh  
yeah  
yeah  
so you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it  
so you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us  
so would it be like yellow grey and black or something or  
right  
um the department will obviously be growing but there are some people who only work part time  
well you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him  
just <unk> <unk> type text and that that would be uh excellent  
no but uh uh you should ma yeah  
okay  
yep  
at <unk> at at least spot if they forget to talk about something and it won't let them continue on to the next slide until they've gone through all the points  
alright  
okay  
it's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it  
well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place that kin those kind of things  
yeah well we <unk>  
they gotta be  
yeah  
well i just said that  
um which will be sent by an electronic chip  
real hard rubber or soft rubber  
oh no that there's a separate set of standards i think for speech recognition  
well uh <unk> we have  
wouldn't you  
the  
because we already designed for it  
okay who sorry have you have you finished there andy  
yeah  
uh you reviewed a paper on a  
right  
it's gonna make it nicer  
<unk>  
okay um there's no restriction on the plastic and it can't be curved on the wood  
or for every single utterance  
no  
did you  
but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say channel up and it would work right  
those are kind of easy um uh uh goals um and i'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop  
yeah  
anything else  
the plus number thing  
we have been of course put back a bit by the eye tracker going down  
okay 'cause  
this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion  
is it here  
um i like dogs too but i can't do that already because i can't draw a dog as well as you can  
mm  
how we did it  
line interface  
well it's kinda both of us  
yeah  
that'd be tough then  
if we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is and how we can further promote that idea  
remote controls  
mm-hmm  
and if you want to use teletext screen or audio then you can press it  
yeah right  
so this is my  
i think they like the speech  
okay  
any questions  
you're both nodding all three  
i if the comma wasn't there it would be in  
yes  
it's twelve bucks  
the <unk>  
oh  
'cause everything's going <unk>  
yeah we want it simple  
mm-hmm  
they're just they're big they're biggest cats  
mm  
i if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job  
um for the merging factor if we do it that way with the chi metric  
no  
um there are video sets and um they have a special button the find the remote control button  
but we can have just uh uh a home stat uh <unk> a base station next to the t. v.  
i think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and britain yeah  
okay i i agree  
hey what's wrong with my computer  
so when you finish watching your t. v.  
you mi you might want to add uh this kind of this is not in uh my project but  
or  
yeah  
<unk> um i think the we had were fairly basic ones they'd have to go on the the front somewhere  
well it's quite a long phrase  
um so i guess that's pretty much it for our proposal  
this was yeah  
it's too much red  
as you can see this is the remote control  
'cause you'll get very sparse data on each track  
no stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page  
most people find remote controls boring at the moment we need to have something that looks interesting that looks exciting that will stand out  
so you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room  
yeah that's right first  
we go faster  
so uh it's not the calibration it's the thing itself i think  
this thing isn't doing what i'm  
if it were so  
<unk>  
uh <unk> why does it help that it's x. t. h. t. m. l. instead of just x. m. l.  
arrow  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
oh <unk> okay  
you have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing so  
yeah i'm sure because since our user interface speech recognition and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy  
no kinetic also  
so if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well  
yeah  
there he is  
i maybe it says go but you only know it's about search through the thing but someone looking at it can tell that it's a search engine  
mm  
no no no  
hmm  
no they said oh we won't <unk> uh we won't uh use teletext uh we won't use the d. v. d.  
i don't think you should be able to mould it but  
<unk> well th that's just the the environment they set us up <unk> with  
okay i think i <unk> heard thursday or something  
lemon  
yeah  
yes absolutely  
yeah but young people have to have all their uh room  
yeah  
yeah <unk> right but can you imagine something like in  
um the user interface the buttons i guess we talked about this already  
wheel on the top  
'cause if you look at this it it doesn't look very very strong <unk> but this is plastic and and this too but  
hmm it's tricky one  
and that should be a and <unk>  
okay  
well i think we'll be a bit a bit longer but okay  
as it happens to remote controls  
if it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit <unk> or i dunno  
oh i think mine's fallen off  
do you know  
so <unk> the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points  
um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there  
great  
okay yeah  
first of all the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list  
alright  
oh  
oh is it  
yeah and it's a problem if there's no  
yeah  
hmm  
we need something that is international  
twenty minutes  
we have about three we have three or four things here  
yeah that can be possible especially for power settings so user can say okay  
i think it's only put on if <unk> have multi function  
what's the r. r. <unk>  
it has to be nice looking  
yeah  
also keep in mind again the l. c. d. screen is very flat but it needs transistors resistors i don't know what more and that needs space  
mm  
yeah i guess  
well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically  
then traps with <unk> various lengths  
uh and uh  
yeah  
yeah okay  
okay perfect  
mm-hmm  
well i think it's two is okay  
no  
yes  
yeah  
they don't work so hard at the finance department  
so  
uh the tape is sixty minutes  
um damped lyman alpha again  
so they they they they there's a microphone array  
yeah  
so  
mm  
so i made a really simple <unk> uh a shape on uh in um  
how  
every <unk> topic would be its own category  
according to the distance  
so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the <unk> options it'll  
yeah  
yep i think so  
oh i need to plug you in  
uh um um beep to find your control was that was in the test  
batteries  
i can't i i i couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button  
yeah  
see you later  
actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product  
yeah and the and the rubber it it will look cheap always you know with the  
but here for instance you understand so we can show this tomorrow to uh to the people at the <unk> <unk> meeting i mean to  
so rubber rubber keys yeah  
what do you mean by linear access then  
and if you reconstruct the stream from this uh this range you will uh get something uh that is uh  
yeah  
but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler  
uh that was just on the <unk> on the company web site yeah  
good  
i just sent at the last minute i'm sorry about that but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing  
yeah  
uh this uh <unk> east university of east anglia ben <unk>  
yeah  
turbo button  
technical functions or interface concept  
<unk> i  
yeah that's  
one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part  
certainly if if you've got chunks it ought to help you know where your dialogue act boundaries better not be  
well we can make it smell like fruit  
or like single professionals or something  
um i guess we should pick the case then  
yeah  
um and i also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product  
no that's not what i want i want  
so i'm just drawing something like that  
well it's this till true of course  
sort of like but that like the problem with that is it's easy to do in the text level  
uh the remote control to um  
and there is segments which hmm  
yeah yeah  
every four some of us knows  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
oh yeah  
important issues about the remote  
'cause yeah the <unk> the recording yeah the recording <unk> pro program is just quite a it's quite a small program  
yeah repetitive strains injury so they don't i think people who watch t. v. maybe too often keep changing channel hurts their wrist  
um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff  
energies and uh  
so <unk> it's very easy  
um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface  
yeah <unk> <unk> speech is a important extra feature i think  
looking like  
on the l. c. d.  
yeah okay but the <unk> print plate of l. l. c. d. screen is more advanced than a normal print plate  
don't you have to move your  
so we've been in here  
no  
um but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten  
they they don't both break  
you can press a button on your wall signal 'cause it always gets lost  
much like any small appliance like a cellphone and they we need something simple because most people  
what were  
line ratios  
we we're definitely going to have to so we've got <unk> and then we've  
yes  
hmm  
uh-huh  
mm-hmm  
okay  
and the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy source the user interface and  
screen here  
okay  
we can decide the next meeting  
so these these <unk> yeah  
so i would advise to um use more uh phase domain methods  
i think they'll be phasing v. h. s. out shortly  
are you going to do that  
these these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage  
maybe the other fifty percent the buttons that are used very rarely like programming  
right  
yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five  
but i think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out but you'll have it afterwards  
um i know this sounds like it was very quick but the  
yes same thing  
uh  
hmm  
yeah i guess we can interpret it like we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme  
okay so are they under twelve fifty  
alright  
oh <unk> yeah  
yes that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it  
yeah  
no i uh  
you  
for example if you want to use a play and back and stop  
well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things  
well they make it for mobiles it can't be that much more complicated  
with this idea what if rather than working with this p. of z. given d. thing that you had from p. l. s. a.  
um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface  
what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary  
yes  
so as you can see well um susan gets obviously the same office which is quite a good thing  
so  
okay so <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
i su i i mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before  
because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo television d. v. d. c. d. player for under twenty five euros  
no no no yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
industrial designer  
yeah i wouldn't yeah  
i th i think i would mark it  
yeah  
um  
another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates  
yeah i have <unk> i think we also have to go to our own rooms again but um well i at least  
mm  
we can't save them  
but i mean it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t. v. on like  
um especially what are their shortcomings  
right  
yeah see you later  
yeah it should be okay  
ah okay  
and then evaluation itself  
i've got i've got no i've got a north facing house there's not really ever sun coming in my window  
yeah  
so i think we'll have to talk to our executive managers and see if we can get away with just the r. r.  
i mean you just have to think of a a task a challenge that is relevant to that type of recording  
or the volume or something like that  
<unk> real buttons  
and uh  
yeah  
mm  
i have implemented it's quite working well like uh yeah  
you could start out with three and if if we hit it big then we can add some on  
about the design or  
the the method  
fair enough  
and a teletext but that is not of the question  
nee  
three  
now i see a rooster  
uh no no  
yeah  
mm-hmm <unk> <unk> you can move uh  
and where where are you from  
what's the pleasure  
is it not a possibility that you're having less context  
the one you move around  
good meeting  
um well the design is very important  
mm  
and then it kinda there was a green i think it was a green ring and there was like red going out like this  
so so we don't uh the <unk> amount of money we have to spend  
uh as in a whole <unk> like back channel  
it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them  
so um and one of the nice things about having an l. c. d. and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it  
so it has to have some kind of a  
some pages  
i know  
or maybe  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
is to design a new remote control  
leave it blank  
yeah play pause stop  
maybe what you can do a test  
okay  
the the um the interface type we're going for  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
and that will will uh will be will help us to <unk> the this frame grabbing card and this video card  
since it's the one in the centre that's not marked yeah  
okay we decided to include voice recognition so to have the standard uh major buttons like on  
mm-hmm  
but if it's a wave length or a wave band we were putting it in  
okay great  
um if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television  
yeah so we want it rub rubber double curved  
there's gonna be somebody going home and say oh <unk> this thing doesn't work for my d. v. d. and my but i like these other things  
yes i've saw that on <unk> on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons  
if you use large batteries or small batter batteries  
and there is you know a set of tags and what they mean and you know that sort of thing  
i didn't get into too many things actually  
i have to look on that  
yep  
um just a a lot of the um  
okay let's go  
on the wheel like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute  
so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular uh add an l. c. d. screen and um  
at each  
and that is it  
so it's more powerful  
right  
mm th yeah  
so  
okay  
so in that way you can have any that means whatever you want without uh yeah  
tricky  
yeah  
mm  
okay  
we shouldn't smile  
yeah  
um  
well it's it's the same for both so i will give a five six  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
fruit and vegetables are cool  
i mean it's uh confidential to the extent that we are not uh i uh publishing it yet  
so i'm wondering right away is selling twenty five euros is that sort of the <unk> is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or  
so we should probably prioritize our packages  
<unk> <unk> so um  
yeah  
uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products  
quite impressively  
'kay good  
no a.  
yeah  
oh okay  
there is no steep soft component but our two k. v.  
well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the l. c. d. because you can't turn it on when the l. c. d. is off  
yes it is but i don't think we have to do it  
kind of works  
but i think most modern t. v. <unk> have it in their menu  
this is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing okay  
<unk> yeah  
well we need to finish up here  
well you could  
we can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met  
okay  
this is the circuit board from the other side  
i have one guaranteed that i don't know if anybody else is uh  
must finish now so  
you have to go <unk>  
there he is  
that's beneath our level of analysis  
yeah it glows  
with <unk>  
so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question and can't change it in order for it to be <unk>  
its job is to wait for you to press a key then to translate that key press into infrared light signals um that are received by the television  
it's  
<unk> problem  
each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe  
i'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget  
yeah well five minutes left  
good choice mister david jordan  
um so is there anything else you'd like to know  
mm yeah  
but we <unk> we can one of the things we'll be doing is um <unk> people i take it or interactions by the amount of time people spend looking at the clock  
um  
okay  
but uh  
if you use a scroll wheel  
yes  
no no he wa he was having locked many things in the proper places  
thanks for this exercise  
which will then bring the data to the receiver  
hmm  
there's things you can get straight off the original format and then there's things you have to do some kind of post processing of the original format  
oh that's interesting  
technical function design so  
i think you can really start <unk> mm-hmm  
so but um the screen is on top  
that's another advantage  
yes so this is your presentation  
yeah i think so too  
that would be a nice uh nice device i guess  
like this is very similar to what our product will look like in the end  
and the kinetic energy part  
but it's quite noisy if there is the t. v. uh shouting  
oh <unk> i've botched that haven't i  
i think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured  
yeah yeah  
you know nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance  
yeah  
um one is the visibility in the dark which was um <unk> idea  
i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more  
let's see  
you know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development  
yeah  
true yeah  
like feature extraction  
do do you want a list of functions  
uh but yeah so they're fortunate have speakers <unk> on the monitors inside the room  
um and yeah as i say the  
i th yeah  
okay and if we use rubber i already mentioned that we can only use rubber buttons  
mm  
i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from  
<unk> my my favourite animal  
memory in the in the remote  
um <unk>  
so it's a little bit different than the stuff which people are using now which is like a l. p. c. based  
yeah yeah  
it's sort of confusing for the user  
yeah  
yeah 'cause i think that that's gonna co that's 'cause <unk> the diagram we got there suggesting that they're only looking thing at time  
okay well that should it has to be remote control not  
or  
geez  
no no  
the numbers themselves  
so um i looked at existing designs and also um the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like what people dislike  
again  
yeah  
uh <unk> <unk> and statistics and perceptual a approaches  
mm no  
yeah  
so  
okay  
excuse me  
uh that should be alright actually  
so um now i think it's the turn of the  
yeah but it's not happen yet  
yeah  
so um if we share it it should go on a <unk> 'cause i can't find anything in my email  
speakers in the remote <unk>  
well i think  
so you don't like pink panthers  
yeah  
okay  
yeah i i was think about a red uh red <unk> and blue <unk> and  
yeah  
something like like say something like that  
so um that's why it's a negative in it  
it <unk> well yeah it would i mean each version of it has been a little bit different but  
um  
so anything that uh is to be added  
so it can be another uh preference  
so gotta have another meeting uh soon so maybe you could hurry up a bit  
'cause i'll need that then when it's done  
into it  
yeah  
right  
so that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside  
mm  
you know  
well we don't even need to do that 'cause if we got our information density calculated off line  
um  
mm-hmm  
you can also like  
i don't know  
what so what sort of bit rate do you get for the um encoding of the this the hilbert transform  
uh  
it's uh  
open it  
right  
mm-hmm  
but if you're in normal flip over you a lot of people write text  
uh  
there seems to be something about a tool tip object that you have to create and give it all sorts of different properties and stuff or  
uh  
no no this is very sophisticated technology technology  
there's a cool little count down clock that lets you know exactly how long you've been meeting as well  
the entropy calculation is that she boxed it under the simple calculation that you could probably write the script in no time at all and  
mm-hmm  
let's do it like this i mean because it does not lose our identity of the product as we  
um the the difference is that we do one more step uh maybe i can explain it better there  
um i'm still going to take some minutes and if i'm right you two are going to give a prototype presentation  
i think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle  
that means you're up  
easy to use four  
oh  
no so i thought that we might <unk> <unk> speak a little bit about speech coding because nobody is doing here speech coding and i would like to have some maybe feedback because except me  
so uh that's done with this with this um <unk> so you're  
uh can i steal the cable  
so that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project  
well it's not a universal remote  
i think shape is is important because they <unk> they really extend  
we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it  
two  
the com how complex or how easy the logic is it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit  
i don't think we really need one  
no okay  
yeah normally uh this uh the <unk> block letter sign it yeah  
and uh  
so  
and then let's throw these features out and see how well we do um because we know we're gonna have them  
um  
mm  
mm-hmm  
okay so we we could <unk> what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the l. c. d. and all the buttons and stuff  
i mean the the d. v. x. and thing like this so it's uh uh so <unk> anyway for this we don't know exactly yet  
so  
hey that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand  
i'll draw it but maybe later  
yeah in the right order  
something else  
yeah  
mm  
so that's yeah  
yeah  
uh very well we worked together fantastically  
yeah i guess the i think the key word there is average 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff  
that's a good point  
yeah  
okay  
but not 'cause a <unk> next year it will it'll be something completely different  
well also at least maybe not a uh an office alone but at least with just one person not two  
i think a three  
so  
i mean the uh the dimensions of it  
the the microphone picks up  
yeah 'cause i moved it  
i don't know  
<unk>  
yeah  
okay lemme okay i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left  
we instead of having <unk> we we just push the buttons  
um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um  
consensus  
right so i'm supposed to draw my favourite animal  
but you know really the these long line telephones they already have delay no  
re relevance  
um i'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause i got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what <unk> the voice options are  
and there's no simple way at least i haven't found one to directly in in a single step sort of s. s. h. and then s. s. h. again  
yeah so uh this kind of might be the uh some kind of semantics of the utterance or or exchange  
yeah  
yeah  
well <unk> <unk> been looking at the data  
mm  
so it would be i think handy if you could take a meeting at some point and say you know  
mm okay  
a universal design which is which is good for both the hands  
no  
yeah one  
i know but  
not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons  
yeah it is one point nine  
mm shall we go in the order that you just did it  
you can make a print on rubber can't you  
<unk> uh l. c. d. <unk> are basically for feedback right to the user who's pressing buttons  
that <unk> well then you're you're the <unk> uh man so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then  
um that sends after you press that that sends the message to  
uh below forty five and above  
and i will  
and i don't mean two people  
yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper  
and you were talking about scroll buttons  
and that's probably stuff that we have to sort of like process twice then  
so basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market  
and also the remote control will only be used for television so  
but it is pen  
and those are slow  
yes  
<unk> because you know in a sector space there is uh uh this much activity  
yeah  
okay  
take my contraptions with me  
thank you  
hmm  
you know it's like like i find a lot of t. v. <unk> these days  
yeah yeah  
okay  
okay  
oh yeah  
and we'll have um presentation of evaluation <unk> criteria by <unk> our marketing experts  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
in thirty <unk> if the video i ten is ten minutes in thirty minutes 'cause it's no not a lot of things to change  
r. r. <unk> the <unk> the the the the company uh logo  
twenty five euros  
and i think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time  
yeah  
standard  
right  
so you could say okay let's for christmas let's try this without the all the <unk>  
alien pear whatever he is have a little voice like i am located  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i do think it's a process i think  
yeah  
um  
mushroom design yeah  
or whether it's just a  
this is where we all get to i get to write on the oops on the board  
it's it's near rather than at  
okay  
um ryan you'll be working on the user interface design  
mm-hmm  
ah <unk>  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
what uh  
okay  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but <unk> when you see a menu uh on the television  
ah okay it <unk> through yeah  
boring it's not fun to use a remote  
um  
the trend was different last year apparently  
you have to add something to the rubber to make it green  
and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use  
uh okay  
i'd just hate for that to <unk> um to slow you up in collecting stuff that's all  
so <unk> th then a <unk> couple of basic colours  
okay  
go back button is good  
well this this is an example of what they would like  
alright  
the speech recognition is out  
mm-hmm  
uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables okay especially in clothes and furniture  
yeah yes or sample sensor yes  
so now mainly like uh thirty nine p. l. p.  
right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay fine  
this is something new  
as for see if we're technologically innovative i'd say it is quite innovative  
so uh  
you should  
okay <unk> we have to take some <unk> decisions right now  
one meaning that ye yes uh it <unk> uh the the criterion whatever it is  
would we be the company that would break down these or uh metals  
yeah  
and uh basically uh it depends like the remote with l. c. d. display for browsing because you have multiple <unk> for example you are watching a movie  
so i'll try and do that today  
right  
no  
so it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout <unk> <unk> just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device  
oh i  
because actually i mean probably users wouldn't view that one too often  
you ha the <unk> the power source is in the upper right hand corner there  
and when designing <unk> the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so if you <unk> you're gonna have dynamic regions which overlap one another by definition  
you just write read read file one read file two  
that remotes zap a lot  
mm  
what is uh next please  
mm-hmm  
that's it  
yeah so i'm not su i certainly it's listed as a separate event in the stream  
there'd be very few  
yeah  
okay  
yeah okay <unk> we will <unk> we all uh  
<unk> yeah  
the complexity shouldn't be much higher  
hmm  
so that there was enough to be able to run this link clustering algorithm  
um  
how <unk> i'm wondering how how <unk> how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things  
oh it's a little wa oh bugger  
uh the other thing we've done is uh looked at <unk> not uh for this current experiment but for future  
no no no  
mm-hmm  
'kay you have something that picks up  
and  
i can add pretty pictures to this  
no you're right  
i mean it's just standard  
i mean if you want to have some people  
oh yeah  
no like uh different measures to the display  
fifty one divided by  
uh well you know how to the documents work  
i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy  
it feels uh good in your hand  
but okay  
well yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh nigh i know  
we have a master machine here  
or the general office  
yeah  
<unk> you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons so you don't need an l. c. d.  
um yeah  
yeah <unk> just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions  
yeah  
that's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five  
yeah yeah it's uh it's it's fairly simple  
the marketing expert  
okay  
double click on it  
yeah  
i just i just need a a title for the file but doesn't matter what it is  
he has had it certainly  
um  
then  
i think this is better than regular flip overs but  
well  
which was pretty much up to standard so we might use that i put that in my drawing but again i didn't not have that much time  
um because it you have to change all sorts of other things if you don't have a sound card  
um with uh the upper part being the front  
but the most obvious constraints that uh we we found here was that it was probably very difficult to have a lounge uh just a lounge in one room  
it it we would have to have an l. c. d. um  
or three because of one on each side and one on top  
okay  
alright so twenty five  
exactly  
okay  
okay  
mm  
and then we've got no option but to uh figure out a way for like to look at this just explore this data  
but we'll  
so again um  
but it won't be very um processor intensive or memory intensive i don't think  
yeah it'll be in the other disk  
yeah  
and um  
yeah that's uh must admit i don't think i've ever seen one with concave buttons that's uh certainly be different  
well  
so i mean as far as that you've got everything to do that i presume  
uh let's see  
are the costs within the budget  
good morning mister p. m.  
two what do you think two in a row or three in a row  
um or would that take too much power would we need more um components in there to supply the power  
i think  
yeah  
oh the oh sorry no not not the slogan  
um if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work  
okay  
and now we're gonna discover we've got no reason to meet right  
i suppose if we're he heading to have it like make a huge profit out of this it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing  
ho ho  
on maybe a  
what do you think  
uh  
yeah yeah  
lecturer  
okay but there's another problem  
l. c. d. screen and scroll  
overall  
well we can try  
i need to open mine  
mm  
oh <unk> yeah yeah <unk> that's why we have to do language adaptation  
oh well potato mango fruit and <unk>  
and that's basically all i have so far  
so it could be grey on the banana one  
so there should be something command controlled you start and then you stop  
<unk> now um so  
eight the remote control has fresh fruity colours  
yeah  
okay  
it's  
uh  
do we wanna look at anything  
<unk>  
yes  
and the <unk>  
yeah that's true  
mm-hmm  
yeah we can have a <unk> like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and  
some spots  
uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not <unk> not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design  
um well uh the draw board well you can draw things  
ah okay  
which if you just said that it's <unk> petersen absorption from neutral hydrogen rather than i if it was a <unk> if it was hydrogen absorption  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
no i saw i saw the file the smart board that x. b. k. but  
then use um  
it's <unk> it's got the <unk> function that we talked about  
that's fine  
so maybe you can use in the end and  
and what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons  
oh  
clip  
<unk> like in uh internet explorer  
i first uh chose for the battery 'cause yeah i'm traditional and that's the most obvious easiest choice to go to  
mm-hmm  
uh these they're all different options they're all separate apart from the chip  
double  
the op  
it mustn't be too <unk> you know th too overwhelming then when you put it on your just  
yep  
uh um because we're using them for back up and for coding  
yeah but i i  
oh  
yeah right  
in all the cases i've seen i mean they <unk> assume that at least you have like a p. d. f. version of the document or what  
ho let's hope the best  
mm-hmm  
you know just like right inside there  
yeah yeah  
forty ish i i i mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project <unk> um  
yeah  
yeah that's the whole idea of the front  
i don't believe all this stuff  
yeah  
yeah if like i <unk> i don't know anything about audio and i have never seen the player  
mm  
excellent  
and obviously other instructions will come from the personal coach  
so whether they decide to stay and do a p. h. d. we're not sure yet  
well  
but you want also these two streams to be synchronized  
yeah  
difficult  
okay  
okay  
that's all  
<unk>  
we have fairly big windows in the room yeah  
and these uh these <unk> these buttons uh are more uh triangle ish shaped with a square one in the middle  
so that they're separate a bit yeah  
number three  
to do this kind of thing you know  
to a like atlantic sea coast or yeah  
yeah  
and after that uh if you have uh a cleaned curve and you can uh just apply uh functionally  
it the emission line is strong  
mm  
and yeah and so can you go to the next slide please  
okay so interface wise is it this third option we have the two of them there  
certainly the button up and down but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for  
pretty much everybody  
well  
yeah  
do we have them with a speaker at the moment  
<unk>  
yeah  
but uh <unk> well i think  
uh give it about twenty seconds or so  
be a good idea  
okay  
hmm  
we can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot  
mm-hmm  
oh  
mm-hmm  
like because you've got a nice <unk> scheme for the for for the the coding of the the smooth spectrum  
at whether they do philosophy of a language and logic and stuff here and they kind of do  
right  
do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour just to keep it give it a simplistic look  
mm  
isn't it amazing  
you can write on the paper yeah  
we are done  
when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and  
you you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room  
yeah  
yeah  
well so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control  
but if we don't have a l. c. d. we don't have a menu  
the mute button  
the digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade  
with a password or  
um the electronics that actually makes the device work we've basically got three  
'kay  
half an hour train yeah  
uh ten twenty minutes  
so you cannot say that this part will be the just the noise which you can do in here in this this other approach  
oh so that's a bit annoying 'cause like it's my hope we could just go cobble something together and just say look it's great  
mm only if it's an astro physically distinct distinct  
now the major problem with fire wire is that that fire wire is just an kind of intelligent uh a smart pipe  
it was a monologue but then there was a snippet of dialogue as well with  
okay  
it's not one of the scrolls where for example with this one you could push it down to be a button  
well it gives you things like accept and reject and  
maybe i  
that we tend to spot only those words  
yeah  
yeah i think possible  
darn  
the switch uh uh uh if you <unk> press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor  
maybe  
yeah yeah  
mm  
it is  
both  
uh i <unk> i might yeah 'cause uh julie and the boy is here  
'cause  
well we just thought we have all the numbers here so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and  
yeah  
if you are watching an foreign movie you get subtitles sometimes  
the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used  
uh two scroll uh wheels  
great  
mm  
yeah  
is it  
okay  
yeah i mean <unk> i i have one what i give you would be one file for each meeting  
but you will discuss a lot less than <unk> like we did now  
so that we'd have to re align them  
uh well i think so yes  
but it's just two speakers agreeing i think  
mm-hmm  
so you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it like a screen  
yeah the fingers yeah  
the <unk>  
um just talking to the um manufacturing division  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
<unk> t. v.  
yeah  
space  
no problem  
so you have some books also like  
yeah  
what's wrong with broad h. alpha  
oh  
components yeah  
so basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to  
so uh i don't think it's very interesting and go through it again  
<unk> really  
well that's where the thinking goes on  
yeah but how can we get to know what makes sense as a a function for joining everything together  
i'm just gonna check so i do this right  
totally  
yeah  
okay  
<unk> the number function  
we're all about that  
yeah yeah it's it's not gonna be a touch pad uh just a display for giving you information  
do we have more than one special colour  
that's still four  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria  
hmm  
hmm  
no  
great  
who are the two full professors in our department have the private offices  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
the other is the  
so  
yeah  
okay  
a bunny rabbit  
yeah  
um well of course i i hope this is all clear to you  
so um  
yeah yeah  
i'm just going to describe  
no on your mobile phone you can <unk> you can read text also  
i don't know what your instructions have been  
i don't know how you how many terms you can handle in perl  
yeah one is high  
but we can take a risk  
it's an excel file  
no no  
means buttons are in the shape of fruits buttons are in the <unk> shape of fruits or something apple banana something like that  
yeah  
yeah so so as the conclusion there is no major problem except <unk> yeah which time for i guess  
does anybody know  
yeah  
uh  
they define themselves as non counters  
so  
uh there are three stages  
or left hand  
yes a kind of scroll wheel  
chipping  
then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons which just confuse them  
thank you  
yeah  
no  
or no of course we did  
touch screen yeah  
mm yeah  
but so much as how to incorporate the algorithm within a new <unk> mission sort of <unk> medium  
in april  
so  
that's maybe yeah  
yes exactly  
and then one to confirm and one to go one step back  
just a list of these uh relations  
but uh well i i want this to to work in the for the time uh in the mm-hmm  
harder to push  
they could have a crap remote that came with their t. v. that's just impossible to use or maybe it broke or maybe they're just missing it  
okay  
uh well actually i'd like to hand the word uh back to you  
yeah but  
yeah i mean and i mean the uh i mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here  
well you can probably also you can probably <unk> filter like with regular expressions even just say if it consists of only dig digits then skip it  
that's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom  
because it makes it also more complex and expensive  
to <unk> to say okay go off and don't talk to each other it's actually <unk> sort of <unk> you to quite the contrary of teamwork  
uh new telephones uh for elder people  
so those numbers are less important then the previous one but still it has to be taken to count  
i will thank you all  
yeah  
can i have that  
but uh what is the the gain  
it would be cool yeah  
okay cool  
so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection  
then it's <unk> like a more coherent framework  
this morning it's all on phonology or this morning it's all on applied linguistics  
well i was thinking of just like really just a <unk> more or less just imagine those are search results each like each of them sort of them sort of giving whatever  
don't know  
uh but uh we could uh <unk> do but it's perhaps more expensive uh the speaker on the back or something  
yeah no i think you're right  
um that you you should put it back in  
no no 'cause i was a bit worried about uh this kind of uh discourse structure yeah  
uh wednesday i've got a nine 'til twelve  
we can give at least five or six seven  
right <unk> so i haven't made a <unk> presentation yeah i i thought i'll use the <unk> instead  
uh okay  
so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide  
i suppose  
mm-hmm  
so the t. v. <unk> has to uh have to be up to date  
yeah as well as your if you're <unk> sixty years old you're holding one of those things in your hand  
yeah  
just  
something like this  
it will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff  
um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time everybody's used to using changing the channel turning it on using the volume  
exactly  
um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that  
so which i think i have all the <unk> no  
yeah  
form function okay  
yeah we need to have the the l. c. d. screen  
all the same uh  
hmm  
you all have to be paid  
ah  
uh okay  
yeah  
oh well  
yeah and then we'll maybe have to prioritize somebody into just integrating it  
what's uh here  
okay  
yeah  
it was just  
thank you  
with i. m. two i. p. one  
what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful  
okay  
yeah no these aren't the exact terms that the um  
no  
where's the money maybe  
um they're uh they're a special form 'cause they're <unk>  
what was mister again  
now if they cost twelve and a half you're selling it for twenty five you're making twelve and a half euros each  
i would probably lean away from that  
about the get  
a what  
and probably a power one as well  
three years two to three years yeah  
yeah  
or do we have to choose between them  
oh right okay brilliant  
yeah  
well it would be very new to the market but  
we i think we have start and end times for words actually but it's yeah  
uh if i if i say until january this is just to finish  
i can't change it so i'm <unk> i'm gonna ask you to push it down once  
i uh i sure did  
know what to look for and what not to yeah  
i know what you mean  
okay  
no no solar cell no no no no  
so everyone should produce stuff for the whole corpus now  
um delete  
because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there because you're only accustomed to eleven i'd say  
i think we need to  
mine's not quite as complicated as all that  
but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older  
uh which means that  
okay cool  
so yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works  
but it's in this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> spectrum of another object though  
or fruit name  
and cheap  
well i guess that depends on how you market it  
i think it's a lot to do with battery but that's just my  
or something like that  
it saves time  
okay so we're gonna go with um type <unk> and then supplements how are we gonna do that  
yeah  
i mean it's a yeah  
well the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator maybe directly or  
like let's drop all the buttons and just make one i mean we're gonna use the l. c. d. screen anyway  
because this is a <unk> like uh graduates  
that way we could <unk> i mean  
we want to  
like it's an international market range we don't have to worry about specifics  
hello  
yeah  
well i don't what do what  
okay  
yeah  
maybe for some people lazy people  
be <unk> about about things  
i thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah  
there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda t. v. it is  
materials  
we're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology but build something for twelve and a half pounds  
thinking of what we can retain what we can do away with uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um  
um the the logo uh being at <unk> the bottom of the screen there the the the two r. <unk> in grey against uh a yellow background  
get that tested next couple days and i <unk> i assume that's not something you need me for <unk> in terms of that  
<unk> as a giraffe  
uh universal type uh <unk> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and <unk> you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market  
i having it i having it sort of <unk> bright yellow i think that's quite a good idea though maybe we could have options for colours as well  
yeah  
i i'll talk to the managers  
but it doesn't work  
yeah and i  
yeah  
long term  
yes well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control  
yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour  
so there are some of the findings  
okay so we want nothing  
it's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet  
yeah  
the power volume and channel selections are very relevant  
what is this  
we'll wait  
yeah  
yeah  
but nee the function of it  
mm-hmm  
so this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip is it  
yeah  
and obviously it makes different that if someone is talking and one is replying never uh nor moving or nor having eyes open  
so i'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh r. c. yeah  
it doesn't really  
no no  
if you  
uh is that right  
yeah test  
so i guess we can go ahead and go to the next  
yeah  
oh i <unk> um basically i'll get back to you on that  
we have we have a teletext button  
yeah  
it's just the uh whether it's the microphones are picking up things correctly that we need to check  
systems  
and there's some cute button  
no  
yeah  
yeah  
but if we there is yeah  
so that do we say we take that out  
this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe i can get to this in my presentation though but um yeah  
okay i uh everybody knows l. p. c. stuff how it works  
<unk> your mouse  
something with a grip  
not <unk> so enough uh well yeah yeah  
like stylish or aesthetic  
okay  
they're they're three month contracts and now if you can't keep that that's fine  
but so we have we have t. v. options which is all this  
sorry it's really hard to write on those  
because i mean it'd be nice uh <unk> let's say if you had twelve hundred bits for the for the <unk> smooth spectrum and twelve hundred bits for the voice  
so it hmm  
and lea uh <unk> delivered standard with a fruity colour but not too not too much  
it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan  
i also have a preference for rubber  
and then if you wanted the next level up  
would it just be universal for everyone you think  
width width  
oh  
yeah on an average we can think three four <unk> maybe  
so your decision can be for example uh who is it or if the person moved  
hey  
uh  
the fewer buttons you can use on it  
i would say two three  
yeah  
yeah okay yeah  
yeah and  
i don't know  
you could take this as an <unk> file and run a spell check on it  
maybe they were under the wrong subject header  
you go  
i think it's a five  
you know twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies  
perhaps they uh no but perhaps they think uh okay the cover is such a nice idea  
oh they get automatic names okay  
so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan and you're gonna pick 'em apart  
yeah  
otherwise you have all those teletext perhaps teletext not but  
um it depends which way you look at it  
yeah  
uh excuse me brian  
yeah 'cause this would  
ah okay so yeah two or three  
uh yeah  
and after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions and then they will not use this dial as often  
um  
okay jog dial for volume  
yeah  
um  
that's good  
so adaptable yeah something yeah  
well no i mean here i can see that it was it was detected as a single shot  
yeah  
so i think we can avoid the teletext  
i'll just walk you through them  
yeah i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions  
i would just try to keep segments very manageable um and a but <unk> you know use these wave forms to help you  
but that's it's very expensive  
uh  
yeah definitely  
i think we have uh we have decided uh okay  
usually when they say seven inch i think it's the diagonal  
well  
so uh rubber i think uh th that's the best  
i mean i <unk> i <unk> uh that idea that i thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a  
uh  
the blue thing  
okay because i uh when you get an l. c. d. screen you run it on batteries the batteries will be uh empty very soon very fast  
<unk> internationally  
irritating  
um yeah i can no i'm not sure  
but sometimes um however there are um short pauses in it and they're indicated by square brackets pause or something in the data  
and the case yeah we already discussed the case we wanted to make it from rubber and uh  
well the first thing i think is we need to uh sort out the call for abstracts or the <unk> the call for titles  
it's too much  
okay yeah  
yeah  
thank you  
well okay you've got the proper sound record  
well  
mm-hmm  
nah the <unk> the television would have to be a <unk> compatible basically  
other things are  
yeah  
yeah okay  
yeah  
so uh no how about the the prototype  
its simplicity  
what i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard i need something to market  
well uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um  
yeah  
because this is a realistic environment  
my email account  
so if we just have those sort of that information like a long list of all the utterances slash segments and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them  
mm white dwarf  
twenty eight  
favourite characteristics  
it's it's for for for more trendy uh  
so april o. six you will have your system  
maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that  
right  
mm-hmm  
no because it has four arrows right  
the final goal that uh that could be fit into the uh browser  
maybe yeah  
um so uh the the industrial manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design  
it's going to be expensive  
and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the l. c. d.  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l. c. d. the display thing then that's even more expensive  
yeah  
so yeah  
yeah just send us an email and tell us what's happening  
um so <unk> we we're starting fresh with these and you know  
same frequency  
obviously  
mm-hmm  
we we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our um more user friendly remote control  
and and there is yeah that's it you know  
but yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time  
really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this  
what  
more on a fancy design  
oh this is just uh  
bit complicated  
um then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make  
i could just use it with the frequency i think until the information density thing's finished  
there is not code book  
just to give you an idea um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well i'm not sure how much time  
interface we have  
yep  
well i think we can i just it's  
yep yep yep  
mm-hmm  
mm  
no aren't the features the <unk> feature and that you can change the channel's feature  
so we've worked out this concepts how to how to hold it where to put the buttons and and stuff  
mm  
ah  
pitch  
i agree  
oh  
yeah  
yep  
you understand what i'm saying  
yeah  
yeah  
i know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from  
yep  
unfortunately  
mm yeah  
yeah you're right  
okay so we need to wrap it up now so that we can go away and get on with some of this  
okay  
basically  
any ideas on that  
good call  
ours had other features with  
okay  
um  
yeah i have a gut feeling it's not a good idea to split it  
mm  
so basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed  
below that the page and the sound  
you know  
um  
okay  
yeah  
but <unk> alright the teamwork  
but then you you make use of that to extend your work in some  
because tho those files are also very big they are not single files  
sure yeah yeah and materials we <unk> said we'd do plastic and rubber didn't we  
yeah  
nearly  
no  
but  
so we ma we have to make it look good  
might be an interesting way to go  
<unk> we can leave that out i think  
sorry  
did you find it  
yeah  
kind of and like you got the rest the buttons but the rest of them like went in  
and if he has been talking maybe seventy percent of the last five minutes as me  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
is there a prize at the end  
you know we we uh uh i we're if we're expecting the g. d. f. format to be um sort of a parsed version of events  
i don't know why  
and then yeah m. f. c. <unk>  
oh well  
okay and then f. five right  
yeah  
yeah a lot of time no it i can dow obviously downloading is another thing  
you can see them there  
yeah yeah yeah  
but i mean like i i the black and white i guess it just doesn't look funky enough  
with your uh wrist  
you've <unk> <unk> you've you've gotta i match the quality before you start worrying about other things right  
mm yeah  
so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down they might both have a v. on for volume  
what's this lazy loading thing somebody explain lazy loading to me  
okay  
as it would be less complicated and the controls would be more user friendly  
and also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be  
twenty five  
but that would give the same value for one word every time i mean for for a specific word  
um  
or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly  
'kay  
yeah  
can't help you with that  
uh um you know some <unk> some features on the control to display a time or <unk> to display  
yep alright  
uh-huh  
yes  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
and uh the  
'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses  
why go to video  
okay those are very good goals i think um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do  
into reality uh-huh  
um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a d. v. d. v. d. or uh  
cool  
options for materials plastic rubber titanium wood  
and at that point even the uh call router that uh jean jean yves has uh made can improve uh its performance  
um transcribe  
no it's two  
mm-hmm  
so that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating  
mm 'kay  
but it didn't load uh or uh <unk> it was meant to be something else  
two hundred millisecond  
but what we'll do with the switches  
um we would use plastic with a rubber casing i think was the consensus powered by kinetic energy  
yeah  
so the <unk> enclosing everything in <unk> and what you would do is  
bleep bleep bleep oh there it is yeah  
maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side  
i mean it might be nice for changing the volume  
oh yeah put them in there  
and that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know  
it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are i am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format  
oh <unk>  
i agree with that  
thingy that's great  
as to the tool training that uh is required  
and detecting when it is uh are two little works that some way fit in that very general uh framework  
tying  
but in that category it would have the same value at each place  
it's not that important no  
yeah go up  
yeah  
well <unk> we'll just call it fancy then  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
whatever that means  
could we have uh a cheaper <unk> cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed  
ah  
yep  
so  
right  
right okay  
so  
ye  
we can make our study on this and  
oh it will not <unk> mm mm  
for instance yeah  
yeah they should all be and that one  
function the blue button  
cool  
right  
we just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway  
yeah okay  
okay so i'll need to do some changes to program manager to be able to handle um changing results  
not mine  
a bird  
sorry  
'cause the problem <unk> when you go through and hand do it is then suddenly you introduce your automatic method and your accuracy goes can go way down  
um the clunky one is the one on the right  
yeah  
we did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that  
the that isn't wood anyway but okay  
um  
yeah  
so i it's not uh a <unk> base service it's a  
it's a inspired design  
they are not uh  
and uh so then you get the fitting to compress signal  
i'm not too fast i don't think  
yeah i've been using up the pages  
mm-hmm  
a catchy colour design and a <unk> because i do i think a dark colour would be nice too  
it's fifty percent no  
it's earl it's pretty old technology  
mm  
so yeah  
the this is the players  
yeah  
i shall i can't imagine these are worth much  
you know what i mean  
yeah  
but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons  
yeah exactly like nokia phones  
we then have the user interface which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote  
that's like the twentieth or something  
and there's uh one very important point  
so i will say that is very true  
mm  
so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro  
so our target group we're saying fifteen to thirty five  
mm-hmm  
i suppose you <unk> try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical  
um now that's i i dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there  
throwing it across the room or as you said people kinda throw it  
yeah  
uh  
<unk> yeah that's all  
yeah  
yeah that is kind of  
okay i understand  
okay  
yeah  
single  
i it's my opinion but i don't know what what  
and basically i'd want this to rest here right at the base of the wrist  
mm  
that's pretty uh  
yeah  
worse than a banana  
<unk> i i <unk> i guess uh th this is my volume button  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
i'm quite  
five with l. c. d. and  
um and then there are two different kinds that i found  
yeah  
yeah  
i think so too  
yeah  
and we sit here together and do it well that's what teamwork is  
okay  
yeah  
beast <unk> i dunno what i'm going to design  
yeah and it's ergonomic as well  
yeah yeah  
so that's still on the agenda to do at some point  
yeah but then uh when you turn turn it  
uh i  
so it's palm held  
yeah  
well yeah and then it'll <unk> preserve the order when it's displayed the  
but i but if there uh <unk> aren't like so it's it's start and end times just for the file  
three  
yeah so that might be the second class yeah  
yeah  
and eighty percent of users and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television d. v. d.  
he is able to use it for like like years i mean he used to write a lot of code and you know it's really great  
i had five  
mm-hmm  
so this is something that has been recently developed by the company um in the last decade so not too recent  
okay so your basic components are buttons okay and you have a wheel available like a mouse scroll wheel  
or twenty six  
if we <unk> if we use only just one uh small pen light then it will be cheaper than when we use two  
and the <unk> i mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there  
okay there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source  
yeah  
okay next  
<unk> a bit of a challenge question  
one is from the other one is from yeah uh engineering <unk> yeah  
we will okay  
in a sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two  
so who wants to send something out to informatics  
yeah but nobody you know it's those new systems are still not general like you know  
uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh  
see that probably just means that the display sort of has an internal knowledge about what level of zoom it has  
mm  
i <unk> sort of engineered it so we <unk> ended up making a <unk> difficult shape  
hmm  
maybe till four o'clock or something  
how would we go about um  
hey i just thought this thing there is a i mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this  
what do you exactly mean with double curved  
um  
yeah  
well yeah you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself for the more advanced users  
so think of what we can cut uh here  
alright  
yeah  
next  
no but i think it's it's already what we were were up to  
okay a one because we designed for that huh  
oh right right right  
i'm not  
no no they don't but um  
but  
no  
so we're back to a one  
mm that's the thing  
okay  
so that if that was in the the voice recognition that would be great  
yeah i know but if if i wanna go to say number like sixty five channel sixty five  
oh no no no no yeah yeah  
and of course uh this famous device  
is that that  
probably  
well i'm i'm  
yeah  
um  
so the red would be the front of the remote though right  
okay  
so  
mm  
i misunderstood that then  
if this means star burst galaxy like activity then that's fair enough  
because you have to close all the <unk> uh the pages before going further  
right  
um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one  
i mean i 'cause you were saying you're just gonna you you're you wanna look at this you know very local stuff  
i think it's  
so i don't like that one  
yes  
it's i improved <unk> <unk>  
and then displaying on screen but  
you you might have to play with it just to save processing time like use slightly longer frames  
oh  
we want a mode indicator  
but i think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker  
or  
isn't  
'kay i'm i'm listening i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing so i'm playing with the play doh as well  
yeah mm-hmm  
um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore  
six <unk> half of them roughly we've thrown away  
i i've never drawn a dog i don't think  
uh  
finished  
yeah something like that something that stands out more  
<unk> yellow  
hmm  
okay  
this uh if it works correct maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning  
the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is <unk> is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic  
<unk> okay hold on  
'kay  
you know what as a byproduct of my l. s. a. i'll provide um a vocabulary like sort of a dictionary which for each word gives an entropy score entropy score  
okay  
mm  
and um  
half an hour  
um  
use the scroll  
yeah yeah  
<unk>  
yeah  
by three euros over  
bob  
they are just red <unk> but yes  
david jordan and our industrial designer <unk>  
possibly  
they had the uh uh at the beginning of the video you if you saw the time code it was six hours ni uh fifty minutes  
it takes <unk> six months to build and at the end you don't know whether your features are really uh so  
we know the details and you know what what is th what is the global stuff  
maybe we should consider this function  
yeah but <unk> but on the other hand  
you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and <unk> you know go through menu um <unk> we'll do the aesthetics  
but it is <unk> really connected to the word  
th thank you matthew  
yeah but the problem is how to <unk> you know if this is a push button controller  
um other things were we were hoping to use rubber most likely gonna be double curved etcetera  
a  
yep  
puts fashion in electronics  
um  
hmm  
that's part of the whole thing  
oh yeah  
oh okay okay  
cool  
um personally i prefer this one just because it's looks easier use it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff  
so  
and the ease of learning it  
i mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now but the prices i read are high  
yeah okay  
push  
but  
right  
uh <unk> <unk> yes  
yeah but but a hard rubber like this  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah yeah  
is the project evaluated yes  
i didn't tick the note bo box in the  
but we're supposed to say the descriptive words of the features  
maybe i i will uh i will give you this file in uh as a <unk> it's a kind of <unk> yeah  
<unk> th this i th that's always gonna be a problem i think  
does everyone agree with this  
okay  
so a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have  
banana i think it's a nice idea  
mm-hmm  
uh but do the younger generation have the money  
yeah <unk>  
and i'm making and i'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are <unk> are more familiar with technology than than older people  
yeah  
what was uh i have su to sum up its favourite <unk> well i like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth  
yeah  
with the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design  
yeah you can de display it on the on the old style  
but like radical good maybe  
excuse me  
three three it's three sorry  
yeah  
um new project requirements  
and you can make new uh <unk> uh new blanks  
uh but  
so again i mean like we could have uh i mean we could quite easily have the the main body be a different  
<unk>  
'cause i think we'd <unk> underestimated how long it'd take to do the actual uh software engineering bit  
uh  
of the these meetings in fact  
maybe fuse it with uh <unk> work and uh do a journal paper he was suggesting  
oh right so you can  
um and they they're each more important than the one that comes after it  
we made it hard for ourselves with the display but it's a cool feature  
you don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh  
yeah  
okay that kind of brings us to this let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost  
so the first one was really very far below budget  
yeah or re change the schedule  
so  
and you just say something to into that and it  
that's all  
you can scroll 'em you can also push it  
i'll go first  
um well at twelve o'clock next monday the lab is technically booked by jules  
well it is useful but it doesn't really work all the time  
hmm  
yeah but it's quite personal  
mm-hmm  
if you open it you have a circuit board here right and this is the chip that i was talking about last time  
i just said it's not my idea but i am the project manager and officially this is my idea  
go for it  
a chip  
say it's more  
right  
yeah but if we need two batteries and an l. c. d. screen that means a lot of space that we need  
yep  
oh yeah yeah  
like we i don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of  
for high energies there is kind of a <unk>  
it has <unk>  
okay  
yeah well but su if  
okay so it's uh my <unk> work is generally about uh using <unk> in uh speech recognition systems and uh somehow enhancing the estimation of <unk>  
or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function and such  
and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time  
<unk>  
uh  
because a user could say c. n. n. for example and it would go c. n. n.  
and it's answered  
data itself  
uh for example i bought a remote control last week with a new t. v.  
man this wires eh  
uh let's say we do and and well whatever cho uh child just goes up to the t. v. and presses up for instance  
it's faster with a <unk> yeah and <unk> if we dis and when we <unk> um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing  
like ones that are red instead of black or something like that  
and you sometimes you don't know really whether it's a mic noise or that person is making that noise  
but we need an lower level which to <unk> uh focus  
to be  
the sign of it  
no  
uh  
and you're trying to first find that hilbert envelope  
yeah <unk> actually it's wrong  
volume control and on off  
that's correct  
yeah and cherries are fun <unk>  
and then there is some filter which is that one divided by a. z.  
<unk> thank you  
<unk> maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use  
so these are basically the two types we have  
okay  
you want to <unk> to move to your slides  
and then you have something like  
yeah  
that also is possible  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
these things can be easily incorporated  
could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go <unk> to l. c. d. on the remote control  
and the last one i would say is um the clustering um to um yeah  
only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time to get all the fingerprints off it  
but if have m. f. c. c. <unk> then like again you have to get the high order m. f. c. c. <unk> and then yeah then you're have to  
well uh forget that  
there's a locator  
um yes in the data  
so our t. v. remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v. c. r. d. v. d. players which are usually attached with the t. v.  
unwrap uh phase  
this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours  
yes  
so we it's it's not bad  
yeah maybe it can work with show view  
minus  
worth the yeah  
mm  
probably not 'cause he's  
i see the problem  
it's just like i was just start teaching and then i <unk> i'll need an assistant  
like uh he was taking pictures pictures pictures and it was going thirty seven thirty eight forty even  
mister ed  
it's <unk> yeah  
you need to start it up first  
i get used to the system  
yeah i think i think those segments for each utterance are split up  
i didn't know that you left out those who don't have words  
didn't click note on one then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page  
um  
then i have to uh uh write this and i don't know if you have to present because i didn't receive any information about that so far  
yeah but  
so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface  
'cause he might oh yeah no no no i understand that  
mm good luck  
i don't know if there is an icon for the program but yeah  
is that correct  
but it must be <unk> a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it  
<unk>  
so it has <unk> has not to be <unk> yeah gigantic uh machine  
you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here  
it just works exactly the same as a computer  
if we want it to be visible and  
in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple  
and then all you have to do is sort them by <unk> information density  
just take stuff from one series and not merge stuff from different series together because they would probably be just <unk> messy  
i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped  
well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point  
maybe don't even have to hold it as such  
yeah  
okay  
so <unk> yeah i would be happy to to to help you with that  
so they never really took into account a possibility of actually performing processing on the document they talk about during the meeting during in this case the uh the talk  
the board working again is it  
right  
so we need one of them  
so if you are vegetarian or you have any options please let us know  
mean people have been using <unk> for ages  
mm-hmm  
you can move up down left right or you can do a swing  
um i would have to agree on that  
oh okay never mind then  
yeah single curved but there's a curve in it  
but uh  
maybe it's just not is it on  
i guess it's similar  
oh  
so it would be difficult to write it back to the right position  
so <unk> do you mean all of the speakers are involved in it  
a blue and black zebra  
okay <unk> we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons  
from caroline  
darn  
yeah alright alright  
strong background noise  
mm-hmm  
no no  
and  
so i will ask you or someone else okay  
no it's less of a <unk> it's less of a stress  
in fact okay  
i thought i should probably look into them but they were all useless  
so if there's a button for each type  
yeah yeah  
yeah well okay  
i you can if you like it it that that just sets it up to do a <unk> a <unk> no that one that one there  
yeah  
yeah some ten twelve channel information  
um i mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me  
okay brilliant  
yeah  
uh the first are the younger the age between sixteen and forty five  
yeah i'm afraid i don't have that information available  
then you have uh just yeah a little bit curved  
so it's quite easy  
my mouse is not working anymore  
<unk>  
so then it is one  
you can draw on the board using this pen  
hmm  
same thing  
we all agree on that  
right  
hmm  
if we just did special sorry you were saying that it would be that one that you would put in one there  
okay so i think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves i suppose  
um we have to decide on what  
so uh  
um  
you can make them red  
yeah i know  
but that's uh  
yeah and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select  
or is it dialogue act dialogue acts  
so that would also be on utterance level i think  
yeah  
we don't have to care about the <unk> in that case because the time code is ins <unk> here  
'kay  
yeah  
um  
yes but but then this this is very interesting because uh this way you can detect uh if someone is talking  
okay  
so we can have another like uh <unk> simple speech <unk> on our d. s. b. chip  
i'm right look  
oops  
um <unk> move on to the next presentation um on effects  
is it contamination from blended iron and absorption lines  
can we get ben to print us out one  
um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe  
probably yeah  
we also have the rubber material  
what uh what are you saying about the <unk> i th doesn't the lazy loading apply to everything  
does that make it a <unk> feature  
yeah well also we have two  
essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet the <unk>  
hmm  
there go  
so you're  
that's true  
so we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used  
yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can <unk> hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh  
okay <unk>  
well i missed uh the option to uh  
yeah  
first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept  
so in case i need something on this f. d. l. p. i'll come to you  
yeah yeah  
big buttons  
you know without transforms with just the data format changing from the ascii  
mm  
the better or the more more used system  
okay  
um yes  
i don't think it's our place to create their product for them maybe it is  
course i'm i'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like  
yeah  
oh okay  
ami and okay  
simple to use or simple in design  
but don't we have any <unk> uh information about scroll wheel  
yeah  
because uh well we'll see about the costs  
mm  
and also how much uh i think  
yeah  
should be possible  
so it would actually power itself uh from a t. v.  
you just give it a shake  
so you i think what you're doing is <unk> meetings into highly interactive parts and not so interactive parts  
um the individual presentations i th um <unk> or sebastian who of you would like to start  
as opposed to your basic you know oval black all same size button remote control  
okay  
uh yeah  
sorry uh  
and we've got special form is the one apple  
start looking through that and make sure that works  
mm-hmm  
and it it's just you know separating it out in the little steps  
but  
right  
but then i didn't <unk> that i should take a backup of  
<unk>  
ye  
but  
okay  
so a spongy banana re yeah  
huh  
we're done  
and then you can make an overview of channels in the screen and select a channel click  
right  
yeah  
but in that case we need something uh hardware here to <unk> raw data to a given format  
yeah  
yeah  
oh  
like what the basic function of it  
probably i was thinking yellow and black just because that's the company's colours with very very few buttons  
and if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this  
you mean banana  
yeah  
yes  
i would give it a i would give it a two  
why is it square  
so we will go back to our own uh work  
so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town  
hmm  
so  
um  
well <unk> then there should be should done be done something specific with it  
yeah or okay  
yes  
okay we make two concepts  
mm  
horns draw some horns  
um oh don't worry it's all said i was just gonna say uh yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh  
so maybe we can concentrate work especially on numbers now and then we can go to c. t. s.  
okay  
hmm  
that's funny  
yeah  
yeah yeah you can  
so um that kind of gets you this ratios  
yeah well uh i think uh if you <unk> if you three uh agree then then that's it  
no of course uh  
because actually if it if if uh the whole signal would be able to be <unk> by l. uh by l. p. c. then anyway he has to design some some framing  
yeah even local transport it's it's  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
so on a scale of one to seven one being true and seven being being false  
yeah that's uh so <unk> uh and also mm uh the direction of information flows for some kind of information  
okay there's the microphone  
be television  
so this is a introduction of our product  
okay  
people don't respond well to ugly  
yes  
voice command <unk> we could specify anything  
but the t. v. <unk> are often kind of someone's old t. v. that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote  
a cost  
but it  
<unk> you also have uh received that mail the new project requirements from our bosses  
<unk> uh just write your name right now  
so that's why it's really even the <unk> standards they give the test signals also  
i think a child would try to eat it anyway so maybe we should  
and also some other stuff <unk> for instance alpha threshold we talked about is set to two point four and uh yeah  
he's having only the results with him  
so um my main goal here is to re envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools  
yeah  
it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control but uh  
we basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the <unk> and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal  
mm  
yeah  
uh no i didn't anything  
but you have yeah  
and we're all <unk> going to list all the criterion  
what do you say  
mm-hmm  
okay  
and uh this is the last point the choice of chips  
do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes they have <unk> l. c. d. displays  
so um  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
um an l. c. d. <unk> screen will be implemented  
wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board  
instead of vegetable some <unk> mm uh natural object or something  
okay so the <unk> the relation names aren't aren't right but um  
i'm i'm with uh raj on that i think you know  
yeah we did  
uh that's about it yes  
mm-hmm yeah  
true  
next slide  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so  
um well this uh speaks for itself  
and that's  
and uh on these packets i want to know the the sound level the average sound level  
like it shouldn't be too much co complicated there shouldn't be too many buttons on this <unk> uh remote control  
what they did exactly i don't know if something different a little bit or not  
um uh slower  
it's not for the client for the user who will uh maybe okay  
and it always goes for uh security in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything security speed and efficiency is important  
okay  
that's what i was trying to do and i before coming here i just tried to to make uh uh a plan  
oh in the back okay  
that that they have  
so we will first start by <unk> the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken  
iain what do you give it  
okay  
yeah it could be  
you have to <unk> shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and  
okay  
then it's okay for l. uh speech recognition and l. c. d. so no problem in energy i think  
you're gonna get <unk> lot higher band width aren't you  
uh  
yeah but i prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah  
hmm  
right  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so so everyone on that list has now being reminded  
no we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same  
yeah  
so that you can uh connect it to the p. c. and download the newest <unk> from uh from the internet  
and from this we basically came up with the figure that  
yellow i like that idea  
the question is also i dunno <unk> do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it  
so you can uh make uh words excel everything  
at least six  
'cause that's incredibly <unk>  
mm-hmm  
like as the exterior  
then it would be this one  
if we're having the scroll wheel then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions  
so what we have is we would have a word  
mm-hmm  
um right  
no  
the people  
mm-hmm yeah  
okay  
for a remote 'cause you  
mm-hmm  
we can get back to it  
yes  
a bit more too yeah  
okay  
and here is a small l. e. d. which is like blinking one which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery  
uh <unk> uh traditional versus l. c. d. well i figured we we all set on that  
hmm  
great  
yeah  
okay  
ooh  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
so we may not need the l. c. d. display  
so these are kind of rubber things  
mm  
yeah there is some kind of projection i think  
uh you want a table to to uh  
but if you both agree with this plan and you think your group will be happy then uh fine with me  
p. h. d. thesis actually  
but some frequency may maybe are not used neither by uh guy the guy one or the guy two  
it's like uh all the semi tied <unk> matrices or yeah  
actually the problem's again uh uh you see the shift is the <unk> frequency if you compared modulation spectrum  
so <unk> uh is  
and costs were twelve fifty  
so what i'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a r. c. a remote control  
yes but what should we uh <unk> i i i <unk> i agree with you  
that's an option  
black and you <unk> i can choose the line width  
or do <unk>  
wow  
mm  
and the goal of uh this meeting is to present the video shot detector to olivier okay  
mm no  
i'll <unk> i'll have try to find i'll i'll have <unk> plenty of uh plenty of questions for you once i once i get to the last stage  
i think no  
yeah  
maybe don't bat no battery only solar cells  
it will be always greater than the mm th these errors of two stationary windows  
so um this is something that you know we're not gonna do everything today  
yeah th th th that i uh  
okay  
yeah <unk> okay  
like tap screens or something or i dunno  
yeah okay  
and like just being able to scroll through it or something like that  
yeah  
we're not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff  
where was this  
hmm  
either don't mind  
yeah i can just give it to you in the format you want  
yeah they have their nite i. d. the time  
yeah  
i don't know  
<unk> <unk> simple simple yeah  
yeah  
what does the cost look like ron  
so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something  
uh-huh  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
oh i don't know  
and then the desired <unk> design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point  
mainly <unk> <unk> was uh programming in <unk> and petr was putting it into fancy is yeah and uh but uh and but then we were hoping uh uh uh th to pick up on that little bit more  
oh you've got one of those oh fantastic i want one of those too  
yeah  
yeah  
it's capable of slowing down the audio but speeding up doesn't seem to work at all  
could you step a little bit more to the right  
okay  
so black and grey is okay  
yeah i <unk> i mean i know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds  
yeah uh <unk> uh when you lose the  
usually say we should have just copied it  
mm  
system  
okay  
yeah  
turning the t. v. <unk> on <unk> or off  
so it should be of course new and original and um it should be trendy and user friendly  
like the top thing on the remote i dunno if <unk> be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it  
basically how how it's made i. e. like how you make it all in one how what sort of materials are available to you whatever  
and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants  
okay  
yeah that's right  
mm  
mm  
mm  
yep  
alright  
uh the sample sensor and sample speaker  
yep  
okay cool  
yeah this this is hard to lose  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah that's the only thing yeah  
<unk> pas project  
um  
yay  
and so when you put it on the table it will just lay down  
far infrared galaxies we can't have  
well then we have a huge problem i think  
um so yeah i i i don't mind this  
so i think the spongy feel gives us rubber  
so then i will ask the user <unk> interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons  
excellent  
and we wouldn't mark that source type  
uh well we were going to imply that so that's nice  
um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow  
special order  
i have a lot of new information  
but you would anyway  
that's okay  
so so that's the one for ling basically and i'll send that out  
so for such d. c. t. trajectory you apply those uh gaussian windows  
no how do i play again  
yeah i i think it is ergonomic  
um i'll ask jonathan if we can postpone the meeting to one o'clock  
is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side  
okay  
alright  
so are we mm  
so  
perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it if you if it's lost for people that are deaf  
so i'm afraid it's not possible  
um but it uh there shouldn't be any changes in the physical connections or or anything  
yeah we have to yeah it's  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay so what kind of material do we want to be made out of  
'kay  
it was helpful for me to putting it up on the <unk> 'cause i could actually thin think about it as i put it up and say well this is this is why and th this is why i wanna do things this way  
yeah that's right  
so let's say whoops  
i think that's just basic what we need  
no  
yeah it must be clear then what what what for we use it  
uh it's not actually the <unk> are still um independent  
coming back on the friday  
so it's just it's uh it is  
yeah  
mm  
the enter key i have a chart here that i didn't include  
yeah cool  
yes  
why we decided to use a flat uh l. c. d.  
yeah  
cheers  
and that's uh at the moment are <unk> so are we are we still talking about using that one meeting that everyone is using now  
cute <unk>  
okay  
it looks kind of narrow at the top and i was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top then that would be easier  
so have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people  
um well i do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list but i want um the kind of functions  
you two stay here  
alright that's me done  
it is  
<unk> but no i mean we could do a slide or a compartment you know  
if <unk> so  
next meeting uh okay  
i mean for example if you're if you're into the durability issue  
we're not throwing anything away  
it has uh scroll wheels without without a display but they they scroll like a computer mouse  
we did just have it don't know  
make our file one of those lazy loaded  
yeah definitely  
how that would power the remote and the lamp  
mm 'kay  
yeah okay  
alright  
the early adopters those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it  
i think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not  
um i think it would be helpful to find it but i don't think it'd um  
but really teamwork were you two uh  
yeah  
huh  
if uh  
yeah that's what i was thinking to sure okay  
um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works  
uh uh mm  
well  
and you you need a you need a speaker  
okay  
i haven't come across something that's been i haven't come across anything exceeding four i don't think  
yeah he did give us eight out of ten though  
like a kind of  
so that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the t. v. just so that it says find me  
okay  
okay  
uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings  
what about a banana  
so it's it's interesting information i think  
and then press what  
um okay  
so you you need a different you need a microphone with um a device inside right  
do you want me to do my um design evaluation last  
mm-hmm  
it's uh  
um  
and after that i have some new product requirements  
maybe yeah  
looks like a p. d. a.  
that's about it  
and for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what huh  
anyway the good the conclusion is to have a back up and uh and c. d. at home  
should i plug that in  
but the sinusoidal coding is usually <unk> when you <unk> at least what i think or uh what i know is when you are doing sinusoidal coding it means you just take the speech signal at the beginning  
and um  
hmm  
or maybe just stick 'em under a menu like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever they're more complicated  
yeah  
um i oh forget i forget the whole acquaintance part but we we all know each other  
they may be overlapping gaze at particular objects which are of interest  
something that your granny would want on her remote control  
because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment  
right  
yeah which is fine  
yeah  
okay right  
oh yeah  
i think that's probably something that <unk> it's best if we take away with us  
oh and joystick yeah  
mm-hmm  
really  
i suppose yeah  
so no  
we need to adjust to the technology  
but um alternatively  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate  
okay  
and um things like teletext put them in the menu  
so  
i'm shameful yeah  
so you can really use <unk> like in uh l. p. c. system  
okay well i expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly  
isn't this an elemental um abundance  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards  
if you did that it's gonna flip once  
right  
is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote  
yep that's the rich iron spectrum  
yes it was already made  
got two of them  
do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next  
but that would still mean that we have to get the speech tools running on this  
okay he wanted to <unk> um  
one  
such as like watches you know  
and there's w. d. <unk>  
not the user the man <unk> t. v. manager mode  
but there we go  
and maybe indeed if for instance the slide stream on the on the right is automatically synchronized with the other parts of the video  
c. and v.  
mm  
okay  
i it'll take some time  
uh which is twenty eight and the processing is directly um <unk> proportional to that  
yep  
why did we wanna put the display in the bottom  
yeah ascii file is  
yeah it'll it'll play them in some order in which they were set because otherwise it's gonna be more entertaining  
with a scroll wheel right  
and the opportunity to use the teletext  
okay  
yeah sure but  
yeah i haven't gotten paid for the first two weeks 'cause um i <unk> i only have a three month contract starting february but i started mid january  
are we take too much time  
okay  
okay cool  
is that it  
and i dunno if we'd want to go with like t. v. show themes or something  
when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six just one button which which can uh change yeah  
alright  
and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on  
every time the that it lit up you <unk> that could light up as well  
<unk> what's does anyone know what this hue and saturation thing like what that no nobody's done much colour work  
and then we get the product launch party  
right  
integrated yeah  
yes  
no i don't think  
do you have elk where you come from  
mm-hmm  
or um does have to <unk> everything uh be in remotes  
i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana  
it can never go to forty one forty yeah i uh uh thirty seven thirty eight is fine  
but uh that this is this is it  
i um uh i would say three  
when you you <unk> you do that  
i'll <unk> i'll talk to melissa and jean  
you could use that <unk> as an option if you have money left or something  
um  
yeah  
mm  
it's a it's a bit uh  
um <unk> much easier for the user to manipulate and use  
it's it's it's real time right  
uh th th th th i don't know technical functions  
so the <unk> a button less  
right  
evaluation  
right  
well when we look at this i'd say we have been creative huh  
uh  
um so i have uh the things i just read  
product name  
i th i think i would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and <unk> thing  
um my function is the marketing expert  
something that uh that isn't out there already  
mm-hmm  
um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve euro and fifty cents  
alright  
features  
i i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know  
mm-hmm  
um  
remotes don't have power on off switch  
so the a. p. i. is stan is standard between everything  
mm-hmm  
i've used i've used remote controls for things like t. v. and the c. d. player and video recorder and  
<unk>  
i think you i think you should well there's two views on this  
easy <unk>  
uh-huh that wasn't very much  
um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is <unk> overwhelmingly yes  
okay  
and  
so maybe you can talk about the function and  
yeah well yeah it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you <unk> ask away  
mm  
no  
but that stuff's so  
yeah  
yeah  
yep  
then it's uh random  
yeah  
sure  
is the design fancy enough  
so maybe titanium it's not a good idea  
um  
i would maybe a less a little bit less than uh a bit more than real time maybe  
okay  
yeah  
then uh let me  
this gives you all the details  
so the l. c. d. will be <unk> sticking down like this won't it  
yeah  
so i'd i think i'd give it a two i guess  
no their their annotation of dialogue acts  
we got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically we're going to reduce down from that  
right  
is that correct  
oh yeah  
it's it's okay  
if if it's for example a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up down left right  
<unk> totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries  
so when it says pointing device that doesn't include  
no it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually  
well if you lost th i don't think people would bother walking to the t. v. and press that button because they lost the their remote  
oh my god  
um well i said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original  
i'll see if i can get see if i can get hold of them for the next meeting  
that would skip nine buttons and four and a half euros  
okay  
so this is the end of this discussion  
mm uh okay  
is this to the market  
or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well which could like link in with the company colours  
um do i need to plugged in  
but your <unk> said no  
or no menu buttons  
but you will be informed via the computer  
well everything else is probably user interface so  
over a minute  
it's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different  
it it used is each word completely unique like sort of does it treat each word each occurrence of word as a completely unique event  
you want to draw something christine  
red continuum  
but yeah it it depends on the  
it does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying in terms of  
a battery like this guy  
oh no  
hmm  
great  
or  
a. s. r. u.  
product prod  
yeah  
no joystick  
yeah  
yeah and the others usually don't mean anything yeah  
we're also working on a way of making sure that the <unk> that the machines return to zero state when they're when you come off them  
it was a pretty accurate estimate i would say  
yeah  
right  
uh most relevant uh most used functions uh they speak for themselves i guess  
although we'll also still need a count of the <unk> just so we can have you you've got measure fixation duration again just to <unk> see if those they spend longer just <unk> amount of more stable move uh eye fixation or not  
moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view i think or so  
yeah  
cool  
well welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design  
yeah  
mm  
no  
anyways that's yeah this is it  
i don't think that this is really expensive but at the end this is plenty of <unk> eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be  
yeah  
yeah we will  
how was that was that fun  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
is it uh function eight yeah  
we're not putting them in <unk> but i think we are putting them in because it's so broad band  
th won't work <unk> with uh to have that special button  
i mean i'd like one that makes tea as well but that's not gonna happen  
are they spoken numbers  
three  
yeah  
well except if we deliver it together with our d. v. d.  
the <unk> kinda <unk> and funky kind of and then the <unk> more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor  
yeah  
except for the edges  
huh  
hmm  
yeah  
it's from from one to seven sorry  
right well that's something that we can be aware of  
yeah  
um at least it works if there are several categories with each with one document each but it um yeah  
mm  
even if we save point five there it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit  
hmm  
um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan which is we put the fashion in electronics  
yeah  
uh i'm kinda liking the idea of latex if if spongy is the in thing  
and is very very nice design  
i i mean it that's uh  
yes  
it's very important to first verify if it makes sense if we have a chance to sell it  
but sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work  
and we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got <unk> point eight left so we've got enough for another  
i i wish you know the the the the room would just detect when an when a meeting's started it starting  
that's problem  
and then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticated compo po components of our own  
yeah  
five  
communicate in between  
um if robin's not worried i'm not worried  
how long is it expected to be  
but um um  
yeah  
what do do we have to do  
he's a tough cookie  
so you told us it was different pieces more than one integrated device  
but  
yeah  
um and as what it the major findings market researchers have said it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike  
the playfulness we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour  
hmm very much so  
um  
yeah  
as we go down obviously  
or a line  
the information density  
just bad ones  
so it's very much <unk> on what you do with your options  
we will find the time however  
okay  
even if we gave this one seven and this one seven that's still only three extra points over seven  
i think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present  
um  
it also has the those two distinct uh  
i don't know if it's filled in properly  
yeah i think we're i mean before we close the meeting we're supposed to come up with some ideas for  
so basically what we want we want to know when a. is talking b. is talking and uh  
delete and collapse the surrounding segments  
i think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily <unk> power channel volume and everything else is is uh  
decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five and we decided that it was gonna be non rechargeable battery powered  
oh that one  
right  
i only have three i just have like our three  
huh any ideas  
what uh not <unk> uh not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have  
can i scroll down on there and see what else  
shall we meet in an hour or so dave  
but i think um you know robin is the person who knows the most about what's required there  
i will also be responsible for the functional design phase the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design  
plastic coloured titanium uh titanium coloured plastic  
yeah yeah yeah  
<unk> not ten times but it depends what what we  
i think it so  
so if we're moving the the green triangle um we've defined a region which is the <unk> the green triangle wherever it is  
it could go to thirty seven thirty eight  
we should hide them somewhere  
yeah  
<unk> to say  
it's a very good point  
okay but if i would say a three then it's six and four is ten  
well we can't reduce that  
yep  
that will be too big  
oh no  
<unk>  
okay sure  
uh  
right  
mm  
okay  
so it's th so it's twelve thirty six talks is that right  
five minutes  
are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it  
well the in that interpretation is definable to frame rate by our by the only way we're gonna use frame rate  
oh  
mm-hmm  
a <unk> a like a <unk> a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote even something like that  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
okay we put it on top  
and could it be adapted  
uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey  
yeah we did that the same  
yeah  
so i do think we have to uh have some features  
yeah  
hello  
uh yes  
mm  
ah yeah  
it's really quick  
okay  
so yeah i i agree with you  
yeah  
yeah i guess that it affects the marketing 'cause it  
uh it should do but you've probably gone past the end of the file  
they want like the flashy lights  
so  
um  
so  
yeah  
we came uh  
yep  
mm-hmm  
um  
that's good  
just example colour so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype  
which should go along well with your look and feel design and your interface  
mm  
okay  
yeah i see uh-huh  
tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that so  
um again i there is no order of precedence here um so i i i'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first  
<unk> nothing you can say about that  
yeah  
um they're mostly no not zero and some of those who are zero are <unk> are still very good  
i don't know if you're familiar with that  
yeah  
okay  
is it  
oh yeah  
two  
so i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and  
anything else  
mm-hmm  
so we come again for the the second meeting  
uh whatever looks stupid  
so we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's <unk>  
right  
yeah okay  
sorry  
yeah totally  
um now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design  
and then we have the problem with the hinge  
okay um we have to know if you want to use uh these rubber double curved <unk> uh case um you must use these push uh push buttons  
are you free after this  
well it's a bit hard because we are going to be uh individually  
yeah  
do you mean  
uh okay  
uh is it good looking  
<unk> yeah no you can  
yeah  
i mean uh there's probably logical ways like if one is whatever if one is the darkness and the other is the redness or something  
mm-hmm  
um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could <unk> basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well  
maybe  
that  
with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to  
in the shared folder  
okay so this is a directory and this is some some some some web page okay  
the first i will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote t. v. control  
yes  
yeah  
i think to sum up the last meeting would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out  
th th this is the first design  
<unk>  
yeah same thing uh um with the <unk> and so on  
okay yeah  
power button  
mm-hmm  
right  
no i don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving no  
yeah  
so more ideas  
yeah it's open  
yeah but i think it's just <unk> missing out the printing if the line goes over the end  
right  
that  
mm-hmm  
um so this is the great product kids i think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it  
i think we took very little time now because  
no  
uh fourth meeting  
yeah okay  
of what we display yeah  
oh  
and how that moving forward is represented in different windows and stuff  
is a good idea  
also decreases okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
congratulations to the team  
yeah but if we flip it open only as much as that  
hmm  
oh there it is yeah  
like what  
supposed to have a great memory we say an elephant never forgets  
i think we gotta fill out another questionnaire to be honest  
okay  
really light batteries and with uh good price  
yeah but that  
one is that inappropriate  
hmm  
um  
it's always where is the remote control  
shifting yeah he's using twelve point five <unk> yeah shifting is almost same  
there we go  
yeah  
champagne mister <unk>  
okay  
yeah  
why  
mm-hmm  
th this is no chip  
yeah that that would be one of the features yes  
yeah i see a long neck but  
okay we're still going  
i should i should <unk>  
look if uh i i  
hmm  
but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we <unk> need  
well most t. v. <unk> automatically display the name which they get through the cable  
alright  
oh rubbish  
um  
<unk> <unk> yeah <unk> might does um yeah  
no but  
um  
yeah  
that one's the same  
many small events basically yeah  
yes oh that's true uh that might no  
i think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information  
hmm  
mm yeah i think so  
kangaroo  
you know  
yeah i <unk>  
right  
i hope we uh <unk> and let's hope to reach those uh those sales  
yeah  
whatever fruit was in fashion next year  
yes  
uh i don't think it will be too much  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
um i guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having we'll get from the actual <unk> <unk> consumers  
so what have you been looking at  
normal colours yellow  
if somebody that i'd point it out to them  
yeah  
i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number  
the scroll heel  
um i was gonna say a sharp noise you know a clapping of hand or whatever  
okay what's the standard colour  
yeah  
do you want me to run it or you wanna okay  
our case material supplements oops we just skipped by them  
yeah yeah  
so for the next  
previous  
yeah  
yeah indeed  
but  
so that's actually making it a lot easier  
so i mean if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene the lights adapt themself  
we're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this  
i don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re arrange it and say okay  
<unk>  
i mean if we record le the flow of the video for instance and the snap shots from the slides to some extent there is some possibility of doing some automatic alignment without having a special  
ah  
and then you you had to overwrite it or <unk> i don't know  
it would be nice yes  
i think it's working  
um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it <unk> very fashionable it it the functional functionality will go down  
okay  
i don't know  
this uh is very straightforward with the save the print the undo the blank the select the pen  
the real remote  
so this is one uh we hadn't thought of adding before but we should right  
i like our little finished products  
and why are we going to do it  
so  
they like uh dark colours and simple <unk> shapes  
mm-hmm  
but  
yeah they have to yeah  
know what time is it  
uh  
mm  
i think we should go for universal because apparently we're a separate company making separate <unk> remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people  
yeah  
is it is it actually a book of names to digits or is it like a few pages  
really  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but when yeah  
and uh  
i'd like to do it in this order first do the conceptual specification of components  
yes  
yeah  
suggested casing options  
alright  
yeah i i if it yeah if it costs gets too much too expensive then yeah we should be sticking to rubber buttons  
mm-hmm  
the annotation about what what would it be <unk> most similar to  
oh he's totally off again  
mm-hmm  
should we use those two  
so i just put <unk> quickly remo  
um they do a lot of sub assembly in the tasks they've been doing  
target  
okay  
okay  
call routing where  
i thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything  
maybe we should try something like that  
yeah  
well so we've got one special button form which was the apple  
and on the other hand there's a user focused approach that <unk> things down to just what what is most likely to get used  
correct  
we'll pull it all together  
so you can just make one big l. c. d. screen  
i have slides  
yeah  
oh yeah well do you know which which which which one was the top right  
i think <unk> could help as you mentioned named entity recognition  
hmm  
and yes you're wrong 'cause that's you're right 'cause that's extended emission and compton emission  
yeah  
yeah it's just a logo  
and they're the semantics of the relations are based on the semantics of the utterances that they're relating as alex <unk> explained yesterday  
seven to ten banana  
you made a very nice prototype and um i think  
but if you only have to replace it every five years  
well hmm  
because if it's stuck in you couch you can see the light  
yeah  
but i  
it's  
yeah  
<unk> uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
uh we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control  
yeah  
we made it green  
um  
mm  
no i don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length  
it's four  
um the components are exactly the same  
yeah  
right  
because that's like the only time that uh was spelled with three a. and stuff  
well i th yeah  
yes  
right  
okay  
mm-hmm  
a custom chip but given the the we've cut the functions down um that will hopefully not be too problematic  
well so  
how much time do we have left  
mm-hmm  
sure  
no no  
we put the fashion in electronics  
the pro okay  
and you will see it  
mm-hmm  
okay we <unk> we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide  
th the special colour doesn't would i think make a difference  
i think i if somebody could write i don't know how difficult it would be in practice to write a script that would ignore um all the word fragments  
but okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah okay <unk> with them which is give a yell if you see one  
you can cut the t. f. t. screen  
so <unk> ah that's a very good idea  
yeah  
but you also have the raw fixation um data  
so in that case the presence or the absence and especially the <unk> with which you observe the words that are on the slides can be an excellent uh uh clue  
okay  
hmm  
but lowering our profit margins  
hmm  
yeah it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing  
mm  
let's see  
you need a internet connection  
yeah  
but one is uh user <unk>  
there is no time stamp that comes from some common source  
so where exactly is this i  
what well we but we have the now actions i mean actions might mostly be theirs right  
yeah if we find them good enough  
yes  
your your m. l. p.  
um this is gonna sound weird but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes  
sometimes i mean you can have various things hap i mean just think about more action movie and thing like this  
maybe you can uh look it up right now  
i have to check that out  
yeah take out the blanketing  
okay cool  
mm-hmm i think uh because you can just go for a good colours  
because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some  
that's what we need for the joystick i think though  
i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate  
there's no text option  
yeah it's little bit hard  
here we go  
you mean this phase the the hilbert carrier  
<unk> yeah critical  
yeah but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy  
uh and it might worth seeing if we can add a little part builder thing into the um model builder  
um that's about sixty per cent of the market so it's uh quite important  
but it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material  
yeah  
you can also control click on the dialogue acts and it will play that section of the file as well  
yeah  
um  
so the uh the the step we always use one and it should be one because otherwise it's stuck between consecutive frames  
yeah  
alright then we finished  
it's yellow  
that's what i always do because all my i important buttons are the same place  
snake  
okay  
where is the remote control  
we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and <unk> uh successfully complete this project  
i got this from our friends  
okay  
usually some mobile phone cover the <unk> number part  
i think that's kind of what uh the intention should be  
savings  
oh i see uh  
so can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or  
a small one  
yeah that's it  
what would you think yourself  
uh you have been in milan a couple of times so  
but how <unk> how will you be able to handle a whole market  
<unk> you mean that you um basically split up th the big thing into um different summaries  
uh some <unk> for that but well these are quite the same  
six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do <unk> speaker independent or speaker dependent  
um  
tried to break through this too i guess  
i can imagine it would seem a bit random just have like a poster session and <unk> uh yeah just have a <unk> a poster session um  
okay  
meeting  
um that nothing has i haven't heard anything since from either sort of the netherlands or from you  
yeah because mm  
no <unk> no you <unk> what you mean like the window lent  
mm-hmm  
it <unk> i <unk> makes it easy to market it's easy to differentiate the product yeah so  
it's like if you're holding it  
yes  
the way it it usually it does it if you one this crashes before uh i uh um if it uh replace quickly then no problems  
computer  
mm-hmm  
nah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh okay  
yeah  
if there are a lot of function on the the television some you you'll never know uh and never use  
yeah  
ah but i mean you can  
and more to the point can i get to it without going ah i can carry my little bits in the with me  
um  
yeah  
like um yeah for each word or whatever but across the whole lot is what i mean by highest level  
you know you have <unk> <unk> french and u. k. keyboard so really the remote control to be international  
and maybe then we can do something extra  
right  
well i would like to to to work on <unk> kind of part time uh uh <unk> <unk> yeah  
this this is really flexible  
also but but i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control  
that one  
or  
okay  
oh okay  
yeah  
oh i think it's uh it's not very dull  
ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things  
our focus is the young audience  
you can just navigate through th <unk> your menu that you have here for advanced options with this  
so it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow  
that's for a novice user  
so just imagine it goes that way  
hmm  
very cheap uh cheap look  
mm-hmm  
uh yeah uh blank  
i felt very creative  
i know i know  
mm 'kay  
okay  
and uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control  
you know these days we have hundreds of channels that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels  
you could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike and then people could exercise whilst watching t. v.  
i think we should group them  
uh yellow  
<unk> but what would be one question what would be the goal of putting an l. c. d. in a remote control  
if you have five black triangles gonna be five five parts in the <unk> five black black triangles in the parts box  
channel switching and then uh at the top or at the bottom some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down  
yeah but rubber comes coloured doesn't it  
yeah  
yeah  
and from that on we can user requirements what we need more  
yeah  
okay  
yeah okay  
to let the people choose you mean  
uh you use these four buttons to <unk> to move around a range of settings on the small l. c. d. screen  
<unk> would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry  
hey guys  
i have no idea still  
so if you've got a combined system it could be a combined remote  
what do you think  
so he was like uh he was so i'd borrowed few of the things from him  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control  
but from that you <unk> one would hope you would pull out something high you know  
why  
but um i think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone you know  
yeah okay  
right  
um  
well <unk> yeah it's <unk> but  
uh oh  
but that it's covered with the latex which is <unk> and softer on your hands  
it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext but not to play with it that much  
mm-hmm  
i really <unk> i i think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room  
uh three disk  
yeah you guys can have a look at that if you want  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but then where do people hold it  
unless you have a  
it's a rabbit  
it's stated from where to where the segments go  
mm yes  
and that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting  
yeah and like uh the older group likes familiar materials but that doesn't mean we should use wood  
mm-hmm  
the one <unk> uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my i have a three uh three <unk> year old daughter who <unk> who who who is affectionately known as miss monkey  
and the phase look quite similar like this  
yes  
yep  
and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control  
it's pretty interesting  
and so with with with this kind of system or locator or something to to think about how have people been been losing or breaking their remote  
uh <unk> uh it's actually it's related to <unk>  
oh  
i think before we can like answer that specific question how we <unk> deal with that  
mm-hmm  
functions  
maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits  
anything to be discussed  
things that are always used  
so do we have uh a hand dynamo  
yeah nice  
i mean i'm just thinking of the point of view of <unk> you could still like lose this remote  
okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons so maybe four again  
so that's thing if we did it yellow  
if if they pay for it because they think oh that's a great idea i'm gonna use it  
mm  
right  
which i don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense  
yeah  
uh i think i go to have volume mute but i yeah  
if it's fancy  
um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition  
okay  
like um the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that  
mm  
and then the last thing is just that it'll be black <unk> on top just which we didn't do  
then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it  
and i think your pen's running out of whatever  
yeah  
hmm  
because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display  
yeah i think so  
mm  
well we've got special form  
okay  
well uh it can't be more spongy  
i if mm  
the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay  
you think you can market that  
is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting so i don't think it's i don't know if it's important  
david  
<unk> otherwise  
yeah  
<unk> great  
remote control  
well we could make a compromise between that  
yeah  
no no  
sure yeah  
i <unk> i mean i'm not so sure because i'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals but i do like dogs  
mm-hmm  
so what are we going to do  
yeah  
remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups  
yeah  
that information has come from our marketing manager here  
yeah it is a set back but  
it's only like thirty percent of the total market  
means th yeah twenty five euros is yeah that's right  
they have yeah they have to do some test in their mercedes some speech recognition test mm but it seems now they mm at least daimler  
um we <unk> we will have your individual presentations uh then the decision on the remote control concept um and uh the closing  
i didn't even see it  
oh well just 'cause x. h. t. m. l. has a nice you know you got browsers there so you can actually see you can actually see directly what's what's going on  
that would be useful though wouldn't it if you knew like what your money would get you now  
yeah the bottom could be like <unk> chopped a bit  
and a battery and a battery yeah  
you could <unk> yeah  
um right  
mm-hmm  
alright and another thing  
so you are actually going to see them flipping between uh when you decide they're looking there mm-hmm if they're really close yeah  
hmm  
this is uh just uh yeah  
okay  
yellow but yellow control  
so i'll start working on that in like half an hour or something and it will be the  
okay we all all set  
the buttons are regular colour  
yeah  
so i think having a key phrase is much better  
right  
i half of time i didn't notice they were there  
but we're thinking that seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh two or three  
yeah yeah  
did you manage  
that <unk> that would be a very good idea  
blocks of parts and then an area where people had to build you know replicate the model out with the parts  
so voice is like the database of the parallel speaker who speaks that this text so  
yeah  
if uh uh if this means intuitive if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's i th i think it's  
true  
yeah  
<unk> <unk>  
so you would forget that that means that you would start it fifteen times over and have fifteen zombies running  
okay i think i know it  
think we have we have now two buttons missing  
yeah i mean uh also double checked in that we're not gonna <unk> could access the c. v. s. from home when i was working from home last last week  
just for the volume uh  
mm-hmm cool  
simple chip  
we just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to <unk> and send that to to to the not the to the television  
okay  
on t. v. t. v. screen  
like a gourd almost or a squash of some sort  
but i guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons  
so but yeah like if if single <unk>  
i think so yeah  
yeah  
pro specially we should next project we should take <unk> like that  
i <unk>  
usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten  
another thing i want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty  
you know um you <unk> all the the filled pauses the uh and do we need to go through and change ones that people did differently  
for for what  
we're gonna all do a presentation and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now  
yeah  
yeah two  
yeah  
yes it's the amount of stuff in the blue wing  
the third one yeah maybe i can share that with you  
yeah  
the <unk> the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah  
yeah it's on the cover  
okay and was that due to my leadership  
so it's pretty squishy  
so  
so costs are within budget well within budget including a little what have we got  
so we can meet in five in apple at five in appleton tower and just work on so i'll i'll have my <unk> i'll make sure that my display does all the stuff we've been talking about un until then  
and hides these functions  
okay one question  
um <unk> basically what i basically what the what be having um i would say the the whole thing articulated at two points  
i did yeah  
so in terms of easy to use i think it's very user <unk>  
so do you know what time of day you might want  
i'd yeah i liked it yeah  
like the keys there  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
yeah okay  
<unk> <unk> why aren't you marking it then  
da  
no yeah  
ooh  
that's th th this is the agenda they gave me  
sorry yours you were or you were here <unk> you were you were here how long you were here  
pas  
which <unk>  
i have the uh  
so we have the de design the a good shape new and so on and we have also the technology thing <unk> will be  
we can take the tram and a train  
and i'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my god you're turning into one of those people no  
um trend watching in the conceptual design and product <unk> valuation in the detailed design um so yeah  
yeah  
easy  
one for the top and then one for the <unk> one <unk> for each side  
yeah uh i agree  
and  
right  
even on the phone  
oh yeah  
alright  
um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components everyone  
the f. f. t. routine and uh reading the signal wave form  
nothing that you really want  
yeah  
hmm true  
yeah well i'll i'm using x. h. t. m. l. uh to deter that's uh all all the web pages are x. h. t. m. l.  
if i can  
okay  
okay let's get started  
but but are we not in in the in the manual uh i mean if you have few buttons no display  
it's  
and we want to do the location basically using speech <unk>  
these are whiskers you know  
but someone's <unk> someone's looked at that spectrum  
which will require a more expensive chip on print right  
okay  
and then there's solar cells  
ah okay okay  
i i was thinking not actually scroll like a like mouse scroll but you know a i can't quite <unk> uh describe it  
the focus  
uh so it's <unk> two dimensional  
yeah yeah  
mm  
there's one of mine  
i don't uh do you guys <unk> how do you guys think  
rechargeable batteries in it and just  
the average is a two  
um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote  
i was in charge of the numbers  
so each of you have some <unk> presentation to perform um who starts  
no  
um you don't need any extra stuff from us in the immediate future  
energy like because c. gyro component like so he's using m. f. c. c. so he's <unk> the c. gyro component for this <unk> yeah  
i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now  
i in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program  
yeah to <unk> it to this this or whatever <unk> <unk> other functions totally somewhere else  
okay sorry to interrupt you but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel  
if we can afford it  
no  
uh we did a <unk> lab test with a hundred persons  
no you're the industrial designer  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yes  
yeah  
i don we are using like fifteen bands  
very nice  
i think that was the main aim one of the main aims that we had  
yeah you have to you have to close that window  
i would say seven  
it's in the middle of one of the little r. <unk>  
yeah we have single curve now and no and no material  
yeah  
we took it <unk> it's so easy we have so little button everything speaks for itself really  
yeah  
taped with duck tape and what have you you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber  
and it turns out that um this is quite good to do uh detection and <unk> at the same time  
and we have ninja homer  
so i mean you will be happy with some data even if it doesn't make much sense  
right  
well i would like to go there but not just for credits  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
the the channel up and channel down button  
but uh let's let's start by the video from friday  
if i got kids and i could choose between uh two remote controls  
yeah  
he flies to senegal directly  
you set  
design and it's it's it's not mature enough  
i think so  
mm  
might be  
um did you get any information on that  
uh right  
they're out there  
mm-hmm  
cool  
okay  
it could have been video naming also but it's the same as a directory  
volume setting  
mm  
um  
eight  
yeah  
okay  
but you can burn it from there  
seven is the ma the maximum  
so  
video in okay  
oh that's cool tim  
or uh yes but she's not around  
so if you get the <unk> very uh low bit rate with a reasonable quality or really high bit rate  
i didn't find out yet how it work but maybe one of you did so  
likes  
you're right there  
i can see that yeah  
it doesn't use a  
um uh it's just a scroll yeah is it's horizontal or vertical  
yeah  
hmm uh i i said uh we want <unk> to know to um to do separation just because of the voice recognition  
mm-hmm  
um but i think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum  
mm  
it's not too bad  
mm-hmm  
which are basically accessible through the menu button  
but the integrated uh button  
something simple  
although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions they should be secondary at least if not functionally then visually like those shouldn't be  
bit late  
yeah <unk> vocal command is okay  
'cause you're putting everything  
okay so  
it didn't  
yeah  
yeah  
i didn't know what he meant but yes  
yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
good  
so uh is it the work uh described in the <unk> uh in in uh in the coconut project or something similar  
i like it i like it  
yeah  
really  
yeah to all  
could can i ask where these figures come from is this market research we've  
right  
i think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push button interface which is by far the cheapest  
mm-hmm  
okay  
turn  
wonderful  
going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones  
how you feeling  
buttons  
uh  
you know the d. v. d. player and you know the stereo system and all that  
and you have page numbers like for the menu and you press the page numbers with your remote and it it'll come up  
yeah  
<unk> <unk>  
you know for for me what is important is when it is ready to be use  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah like in the email of television only  
makes sense  
right  
yeah yeah yeah that's true  
and uh after that i put up a scheme about how uh these things are <unk> and i'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds  
the end product thingy  
uh  
okay if we if we're going down that route then  
except we can't uh we can if we then yeah i'll take a note it's fine  
well it's <unk> still sub bands no  
um i will li list the agenda for today  
mm-hmm  
and if we decide to re jig this at some finer  
the feel  
ideas  
really  
uh  
your thesis should be <unk> in one direction  
<unk>  
yeah  
you can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your <unk> uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape  
isn't it  
um we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control  
mm  
um  
and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre because that's getting very popular  
there was no way for us to have  
you wanna separate uh  
mm  
so  
project documents is on the um desktop  
and the the i know i'm we we see quite well why is working on this right  
as long as it this is possible  
oh there's no <unk> okay  
oh right okay  
i'd i'd say just anything that seems unmanageable  
um  
i don't know if we wanna do it on remotes  
because they weren't i don't know  
uh you can put in these sort of of things  
presumably  
because i mean obviously they all write it the same  
well not main documents this time  
it can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it  
mm  
mm-hmm  
um after the opening we will <unk> get acquainted to each other  
yeah  
hmm  
um i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase  
but see is a actual full word shouldn't it there <unk> shouldn't there be a space between see and the hyphen  
okay  
but do you th you do you know what chip we need  
so yeah  
that's <unk>  
so you know  
it's like more more expensive to have shape like that  
yeah the entire theory is based on intention and the intention of one individual  
mm-hmm  
and uh the criteria based on real <unk> kinda goals and policies marketing strategies and also those i put together from the user requirements phase  
yeah  
mm  
yeah let's just assume it's a good l. c. d. display  
is it  
gotta wonder though if we're adding so much technology to this one remote  
different different colours yeah  
because because all the other pages are voting in different direction  
so the <unk> the plus <unk> once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple won't it  
or no is it as much as that  
yeah  
and this does not happen for many reason  
oh it just gives an answer  
cool  
yeah  
yeah i suppose  
you have the same message of uh windows cannot um  
as as stable as it is there must be a compromise between um stability and design here so  
but then you can't  
okay you can you open the conceptual design presentation  
so i think we're better off spending money in the <unk> phase  
yes now we're moving with the headphones  
mm 'kay  
well yeah  
a  
no but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front  
uh  
yeah  
hope you had a good lunch  
mm  
um i've had word down from head office that something that we should be <unk> well  
mm-hmm  
yes  
but  
so it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there  
yeah  
one <unk>  
yeah yeah  
but star burst refers to  
yeah it was recycling uh kind of  
because i definitely think we should restrict it to i think we should um be able to restrict it to specific speakers and things like that  
i think these are the practical problems  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but the there's there's <unk> there's <unk> not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller  
um  
um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism  
finds your  
mm-hmm  
yes a one  
alright  
so this is when you start shifting around your laptop to think that it gets somehow less <unk> on the screen  
you have infrared and an <unk> um uh how to say it  
well yeah  
maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors but a lot of calculators yeah have solar power  
some yellow  
uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function  
yeah but  
mine is amber  
everything  
ah yeah that wouldn't make sense  
the <unk> files and stuff  
can yes three two  
we're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore so infrared is not uh  
um i think we worked together pretty well  
nah  
we're watching trends  
but could be done of course  
so even if they are not perfect places  
um each time i uh i had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think  
yeah  
well yeah it is a bit uh well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things  
yeah  
true  
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice big easy buttons to press but still quite simple and quite cost effective  
uh teamwork  
you know these are the kinds of things that we'd want and look you're gonna need um this kind of dialogue or argument structure for it  
you wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want  
the remote control i it has speech recognition  
uh i mean ho how many times do you really seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it  
then the whole sentence and laughter in you know at the end as well  
it's like a bug or something  
so then we should probably put it here  
and that's one of the that's one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it  
um  
uh good and bad  
it's fun to work with this pen  
it gives a time stamp and inside each one there's uh the actual like utterance segments  
and uh don't <unk> we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions but we we should stick to the basics  
hmm  
therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction  
presented by name  
i think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu i think it's possible just the way how to  
yeah sure  
oh okay  
she is  
um no not really yet but i've some ideas and i will uh  
i would say two  
other side yeah yo wa your wrist  
course you can do that  
i don't think so  
um mean  
ah  
sell trying to sell your things  
um between one and two  
i believe it's fancy too  
um okay here are some of the findings  
maybe the person has a point point not the not a p. d. f. version  
you you only have the labels for some uh small part of the  
should be  
will be taking over in that time scale  
radically different shape  
this is  
uh we have the on off button at the tip very visible very big  
uh it's uh  
it's  
what do you mean by <unk>  
yeah  
well done  
mm-hmm  
did you  
no  
it's not so bad so  
mm-hmm  
okay  
we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this this is how far we've progressed  
alright and i will switch up <unk>  
so if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture a spongy one or a soft one or something like that  
um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control  
so what do you think for it usefulness  
yeah  
well uh do we sell other stuff  
uh uh thank you  
like having  
six  
and if you want it to go into slide show mode it's that little button there  
okay okay  
the plan is uh that uh each one of you  
for for everything also for the advanced options  
we can plan further i think  
okay  
well mm it's not in the list  
yeah  
yep  
i mean is it's reality  
uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip and the user interface obviously contains everything  
yeah  
uh i'm just gonna open say a few boring words to start with again and start taking minutes afterwards  
how about with <unk> the logo isn't that going to cost us some money  
well what  
mm  
shall <unk> shall we dive in in the interim  
uh and then  
this  
okay  
um so uh i guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway  
the volume teletext and  
uh with different colours and with different pen widths  
yeah but once you once you finish your p. h. d. you go and it's over  
just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes which is far too expensive  
yeah  
okay <unk> so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated  
on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber  
well  
um so what i did is i i decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself  
yeah yeah yeah like those  
right  
okay  
yeah  
i like it  
single curved which means that it has uh curves in one dimension  
yeah  
'cause  
we already uh that's the from the for the buttons  
no because there are more yeah we shouldn't sum like that  
least i won't be transcribing the what do i care  
yeah  
yeah  
it's in between exactly  
okay and  
i'll just put that there  
um eight  
can you send me a link to that paper so that i'll implement that in <unk>  
so we know that doesn't work  
throwing and the kinetics  
okay  
well okay maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost  
the star burst you can't say here is a star burst  
i don't know i mean it 'cause you don't have specs about what sorts of shapes are allowed right  
the mexican food is okay it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks  
hmm  
what else  
in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching and i'll be doing marketing research on the web  
so we have five minutes left  
j. p. is quite yeah uh-huh  
yeah  
oh next  
and after that it will be sent to the infrared  
so i mean uh you could begin with <unk> saying the a um the simple task of just determining whether or not the speech is related to the slide content  
star forming galaxies  
<unk> guido <unk>  
mm-hmm  
there is nothing new more or less  
batteries are uh quite  
can you open my presentation please  
okay  
numerical computation according to your display  
<unk> putting the fashion in electronics  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
like yellow yeah  
feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible  
okay  
too expensive  
i personally would look at things like having a <unk> universal remote is uh um is a good idea  
but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen like you know  
th th th yeah  
who wants to be next  
<unk>  
yeah  
okay so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection the volume selection and the teletext  
fifty euro cents  
do you think it would be possible for you to do an like something like segments or maybe just a copy of segment which has an attribute for for each segment  
but both  
no  
mm-hmm  
but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control  
so i mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which i think given the target group is what you would expect really  
well  
and  
okay  
oh 'cause it was moved back wasn't it  
it  
so i i i definitely just want to know something very rough on when you expect to finish this  
do you want to use the wipe the <unk> the wiper and wipe it off  
uh functional  
yeah  
which is uh quite a great score  
definitely better quality  
no no no  
uh-huh  
well it's it's gotta be chew proof  
mm  
okay if there if there was if there was hand labelled data that you could evaluate again so train on some and evaluate on some  
the the red buttons  
mm  
that one i would i would flag just like you did  
no  
uh the first one is that there should be a fancy look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel  
so and in this way our product is good  
hmm  
yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard t. television so it also works on that  
and there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's <unk> to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else  
but we would like to do this more automatically and in particular for the text recognition to do to be able to do retrieval uh of slides or points  
great  
so  
yeah  
um i'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is  
oh we're always long  
<unk> in a natural <unk> context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to <unk> ourselves from each other  
right what have we got different here  
you have the the pen function eraser function  
this is <unk> only the possibilities  
so if there's more than one meeting displayed  
if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one or if it is false  
you know your pen vibrates  
is that it's saying that what does that actually say  
it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for  
yeah but i think it's yeah sorry i haven't written my personal references  
one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price  
but uh are <unk> can you live with it  
there's different parts there's different parts whether you're doing the <unk> or whether you're doing an <unk> airplane or whatever  
it's that's uh uh one  
so  
yeah  
yes a concept on uh just  
them they're terrible  
like how much does you know a remote control cost  
and by the way you don't do the overlap on the sub bands no  
what way we would go  
hmm  
yeah  
but if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in britain they have uh different things they can do with the t. v.  
um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but <unk> how you can push them and stuff like that  
um so what's the high level version again  
uh i if the if the costs allow we can have like an l. c. d. display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well  
okay what about uh sound settings  
hope he's not involved with these actually  
and for rest you'd just add juice on the battery  
um as i said before remote controls are subjective different people want want different things  
yeah  
oh i'll <unk>  
great  
um so  
yeah  
yeah  
ah okay so maybe like here for instance it is a just reproduced two times uh  
mm-hmm  
they're actually the same physical size and shape  
you don't think so  
so i'll <unk> what we said about that part that um every time you cast off a new part from a mold or  
um yes i'm not sure whether we need to know exactly where they are just how many there are in each <unk> um uh <unk> i don't know  
no no put stuff inside it  
more  
so i think this should be a good idea to put this features  
yeah it's it's yeah  
yep  
<unk>  
uh we've to generate sixteen in total  
yeah  
here we have an elephant  
i am hungry  
yes my my my uh  
'kay  
but you should uh direct  
and the findings well  
yeah it's just wait sorry i just re sized it a bit  
a special colour why a special colour  
okay so it <unk> it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan  
uh-huh  
yeah people are pro i would think that people might forget i mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there so  
it's your job so i hope you you know what it is  
i bet you can just uh just add it to the um panel  
okay  
i mean it's not not that it ever happened but yeah  
whereas as people get older they're a bit more <unk> about it and they're less willing to to try it  
um so i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh mm mm  
hmm  
before we leave this meeting it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get  
you say there was a fixation from this time to that time and there was blink from this time to that time  
a seven  
hubble  
you do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red and stuff like that yeah  
oh  
yeah like up down left and right  
um and that can be used uh to represent one um unintelligible word or multiple intelligible words but just use one at symbol  
anyone remember when  
so  
so what we can do is try and just <unk> work on a consensus system so  
um we will start with the uh manager expert <unk> who will talk about uh user re requirements whats user needs and what it desire for this <unk> device  
you got a email about voice response  
everybody was using materials that <unk> i didn't have  
yeah  
yes but i think it probably was and just hasn't printed because olivia wouldn't have started marking at fourteen o. two  
i don't think so  
oops  
uh yes it does  
oh okay  
yeah  
i dunno if if you disagree but i think it's doesn't matter very much  
perhaps the rest  
mm yeah  
uh yeah  
but until i think of something better  
but it would i be interesting for our marketing team to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be  
okay good  
they are that's really enough on  
mm-hmm  
yeah uh so what it does the this is the the bit that took me forever to understand actually uh same model  
so  
mm-hmm  
people who go to decision making meetings want to know if they've missed one or are arriving late or anything like that  
oh yay  
no  
real reaction remote  
and <unk> then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings  
so  
yeah okay  
so that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea  
ah  
mm  
yeah that's true but uh  
um  
then it's okay  
oh great  
yes and informatics we could think about it as well  
mm-hmm  
simple  
so yeah once you have locations it's not a big problem  
yeah that's probably a better one to discuss it straight away  
good job guys  
re results what does it mean  
yeah <unk> but but here you have to take a responsibility  
you go back and actually yes they were crap  
<unk> between <unk> one and seven  
if you have the l. c. d. but if <unk>  
uh when you press a button uh that's when you do <unk> for example when you uh want to turn up the volume  
chip  
is actually a button as well you could press it you could press that and have it as a menu button  
yeah  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
we shouldn't screw it up more than we have to  
yeah  
so okay  
mm okay  
so the case we've gone for the double curved  
um u. i. d. well yeah you right <unk> your assignments are up there and you'll also get <unk> assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do  
that's way far down lapel mic  
yeah  
it's whether the models are optimal or not that i think that's right  
seems to be good  
yeah  
kind of a banana  
um  
no no because uh we did the software here and it they didn't choo no our uh software  
we aim to do this profit  
mm  
can you make an uh uh  
and you  
but that's different situation because right  
say  
so if you really want peace and quiet you shut the door and when the doors are shut  
yeah  
we <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
because that's just a matter of responsibility for you guys to but there is nothing bad if you say you have other things to do  
and why did you choose this animal  
oh okay  
or well uh just hide the few buttons <unk> of switching it open or something the usual uh stuff  
finance  
mm-hmm  
um and make it for an international market  
instead of using infra red  
mm-hmm  
and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double curved shapes  
that's a very good point  
two  
and um we have a special colour for the button and we also have a special form  
ah okay  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
with the ones  
we also uh just uh released a t. f. t. uh thing i saw  
yeah good market i guess if people are ready to pay more  
that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control  
okay i didn't <unk> you had that bit  
okay  
drop yeah  
<unk> two phases uh after this the conceptual design  
so don't try to tell me march or april i <unk> if you already know that it is unrealistic to say that  
mm  
if you flip the printed circuit board and this is th the most important point here uh everything else is kind of  
so there we go and and um we have the banana based one too  
so yeah of course you've got your specific instruction as usual  
i <unk> i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial and that the central button could have maybe our logo on it  
no that's that's too busy i guess  
like good to hold based on fruits and natural things like that because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow you know  
i dunno  
flesh like than <unk> sort of  
but i remember we weren't gonna mark line ratios but we were going to mark <unk> we're here where you've got equivalent width of h. beta <unk>  
and i see you in uh thirty minutes  
<unk> we will uh in a minute we will uh start with them  
yeah one  
so if you have some experience good or bad with remote controls you can share it and say what you <unk> what is your idea  
integrated <unk> circuits chips or do you have low level or or very very expensive  
would probably be like a <unk> little <unk> wheel like this  
that was 'kay  
in fact they're in the constraints email that i got  
and you're looking for a peak  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat  
you are marketing <unk>  
so is the agenda  
so these are the three <unk> <unk> for our evaluation of our product  
i would recommend like say this one  
that'll cover most of 'em  
yeah  
uh i think that the the r. c. together takes away the the the image of it's a triple  
make someone <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay  
whether it is temperature or whether it is temporary  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah okay  
exactly  
uh yes  
medium but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing  
yeah  
we've just talked about <unk> <unk> underlining features  
hmm  
make it a bee  
mm  
if i make mistakes uh you'll uh  
okay  
oh dear  
um well the two key holders are here  
right  
oh yeah  
yeah  
we are talking about the project plan and we are going to to discuss about <unk> our first ideas and so on and yeah  
yeah just as a fun gimmick  
so what you can see for a one second signal you <unk> more or less you already might see some like one  
two and two thirds  
i think that's enough for the next phase  
mm-hmm  
sure  
do we take them off  
and  
yeah that's the main thing even  
no  
yeah  
i think maybe if you he  
we would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings  
yeah  
but you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button  
yeah  
but  
understand  
what is that comma doing there  
i know what because it's on the television  
mm-hmm  
uh also the link with uh mobile phones  
yeah you push the scroll button  
alright but first we will do some uh tool training  
um <unk>  
maybe we should talk about it on a <unk> in a later meeting  
because at some point he has to get into  
mm-hmm  
curved then it will be square  
and then you get like an intuitive <unk> uh like how would a person cluster pages given the what these topics supposedly are  
okay  
okay  
um i don't know about anybody else  
yeah but why i i'm not sure  
mm  
yeah of course  
well if you you take those th if you  
so you wouldn't expect that to necessarily um apply uh in in wider contacts in a way  
we need one  
ooh  
and i think i think we've got a number of ideas for the the spectrum  
yeah i mean um we have uh <unk> uh our several topics  
apparently does that include like champagne or something exciting  
what you what what'd you get on the l. c. d. screen  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
can't we say fifteen euros  
yes  
um  
do you want  
huh  
okay so so okay  
i i think it's it's clear uh how it works  
oh  
in the streets like asking to young peoples well do you like to have a banana as a remote control  
you are applying again to some linear prediction model after that  
says  
i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark  
and that came up with uh a big problem in that most web pages have very very little text on them  
it should also be uh have a reliable image so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all  
might not be such a big hit in greece who knows something like that yeah  
okay  
and <unk> less <unk> less spam probably  
mm-hmm  
okay it's perfect  
should i do it again  
we need yeah so i i just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account  
it has to work on <unk> uh all televisions  
okay and and voice command did you uh  
so uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan maybe a colour  
mm-hmm  
th there uh um at the sort of <unk> very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l. c. d. remotes that can be uh programmed in <unk> much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models  
and then you you get stick to hundred hertz sampling ten millisecond sampling or uh something and then you just pick up the trajectory  
i mean sometimes it doesn't if you know sort of for part of speech tagging you know  
you have to <unk> speed up  
we agreed for to keep hubble  
yeah but we shouldn't have done  
but  
yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well yeah  
well <unk> <unk> which one did you like  
okay a one  
somehow  
you're on the knife  
i think it's something we should put into consideration  
that's not very uh handy but if you know that then it's not a problem  
because i think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it  
i it's the same concept as the pen where you <unk> have to download the software or <unk> uh very uh slow  
yeah that's what i thought that you're not supposed to do it but um the one there's one i'm transcribing right now  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and just <unk> <unk>  
mm mm  
uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh <unk> from zero to nine and then ten  
so you don't have a  
i'll be straight forward enough i think  
so <unk> does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it  
for a just to choose a colour at random here  
yeah  
matthew is uh late again  
we give people something simple and <unk> where something is moving and where they don't have to <unk> deal with any numbers or text or anything like that for that matter  
th that's not a problem  
see the prototype  
um well well my presentation just now  
i played i think seven times solitaire something  
to the feature of the spectrum  
um no teletext  
right okay  
batteries go weak as well so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh  
yeah that's fine  
yeah  
now  
so  
yeah  
we could have like an adam and eve type commercial and that's the fig leaf  
mm <unk> my personal preference is out  
it looks very very cute  
no i don't think so  
you have just put <unk> batteries that are rechargeable because it's an it's it's it's very annoying  
crap  
but just  
um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits  
and there there was something else also  
okay  
<unk> yeah  
the last but not least younger people are more critical about the features  
yeah  
like because and if and so forth but i'll put most of it in the reports  
yeah  
but um  
okay  
uh uh four  
how are you today  
mm <unk> or continuum flux  
mm-hmm  
but we have to look <unk> i don't know  
i i <unk> usually put more money than brains  
okay  
mm mm  
so i give it a a four  
uh i figured uh that much  
fair enough  
well basically the menu options indeed  
i mean i think one should lose that i take it  
mm-hmm  
well this is really your decision but  
so there's uh some trade off between availability and speed from start to finish given that this is somebody else's code  
okay  
because i don't think but you should uh <unk> you should know that  
um so it was all about you know how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control you know  
luck  
yeah not user friendly  
so you're three  
so <unk> you just can't make a nice remote  
yeah  
oh so just have an hour and a half in the morning  
yeah  
yeah but do you think it will be easy to use  
<unk> i personally would prefer it on the top  
the the uh <unk> wasn't it that according to the uh acronym rule the first one  
and um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
well the the when they are they are the the they have batteries in them  
yes  
right  
mm  
and we were talking about what you were gonna do next after all this stuff was up and the i was gonna look at the g. d. f. spec  
um booklet  
yeah  
like they don't flick onto  
if it uh works  
oh right  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
um so yes as long as it got that in it somewhere  
remote okay  
<unk> what is likelihood  
so <unk> basically what you're saying here one minus alpha say link contribution you can call this i guess  
we can think that you know with the wire you know without a wire  
really uh it it means nothing to say a minute it's just a <unk> a really crude guideline  
okay  
um can really appeal to a to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of uh channel changer  
oh you have to <unk> press it pretty hard  
the <unk> diva  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah  
but i don't answer yeah  
yeah  
if we want to use the l. c. d. display we really need the advanced version which is a bit <unk> little bit more costly  
if it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't nobody wants to buy those any more  
no teletext  
yeah but  
it is it has all the features um a normal remote has  
um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment  
so at t. n. o. they have something  
no  
well we can very easily  
you forgot that  
um  
mm-hmm  
uh a normal wire would be better  
yeah but it's it's  
so we must build in something or they will to uh go to the concurrent  
okay  
whoa  
so um you know if we do talk about that then it might be nice to have her along for it  
yeah but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of  
okay  
does that work  
apple green brown more kinda trendy you know khaki  
yeah  
forty minutes and about uh  
yeah and um  
and uh therefore use fresh colours  
it's a fly  
well so colour it seems that we have the several colours for the l. c. d.  
i was trying to think of like the design of others  
about th  
so  
so jasmine if if you got something like this and like this for for your current data would that help in  
it might  
um  
with the speech recognition which of course may  
yeah well yeah  
right  
uh i figured it will be <unk> rather than hard nah rubber <unk> uh this is a casing yeah  
well that's it i think  
so you can say fancy  
now this was our  
not exactly uh  
close together  
it should not be completely like uh a cube  
okay  
but if you <unk> like change a rule now on the fly then that might be then that might <unk> uh create inconsistencies with the  
f. f. five  
and the next is celebration  
the other presentations  
yeah me too  
so do you think <unk> like both of you then can map something onto their segments like just each of you provide one value  
is it <unk> the two a. a. <unk> batteries in it  
alright  
yeah to run th to make it run  
oh  
but um it's not clear enough in the documentation  
oh  
we weren't doing broad band <unk>  
uh yeah  
so apart from like uh a search box and the similarity thing <unk> once that kicks off  
right  
so all those buttons that <unk> are to do with teletext oh screen placing  
that explains a lot  
<unk> what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables  
okay  
the l. c. d.  
we will talk about it later  
okay  
yeah  
but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to <unk> to uh bring uh like a black r. c. on the market or whatever  
when you have a more advanced elaborate user well such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions  
and the second group about forty percent  
i know let's think of it like a little jingle  
yeah that's uh that's something which i wanted to ask you also like what will be the each individually the cost of it  
or oh  
yeah  
oh  
it's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll wheel without the pushing then it's not expensive  
yeah  
it's okay  
in the centre yeah sure  
the newest features are like i said are uh l. c. d. and uh speech uh control  
excess buttons  
oh  
so whatever  
then it's probably quicker to just  
mm-hmm  
so why why should we invent uh <unk> spend more time on those  
and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh  
there may be or not a construction already begun right  
no no  
we we want a more adult version  
what i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball  
brian this one also i  
yeah  
but as as far far as we can and find the the web site of the yeah the the creative labs web site and the review of it  
does that sound good  
of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control  
yeah  
so i'm just you're happy that it's not gonna have frame rate uh like this  
<unk> we we he drew the <unk> the side but you <unk> you weren't paying attention as usual  
like besides the basics i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are  
mm-hmm  
you need additional yeah  
so  
yeah me too  
but <unk> <unk> do you what do you think  
well <unk> well let's start with the beginning just one by one  
shake it and the buttons fall off  
yeah uh oh okay  
mm-hmm  
so yeah  
mm-hmm  
well from us all yeah from all of us  
more or less  
it's as simple as you we could make it really  
right  
our basic goals here what we want to accomplish  
so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side  
uh  
no titanium  
uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top  
what is that  
and i thought the the button for teletext <unk> uh apart because it's not really options i think  
and then um your v. c. uh and then the channel through your v. c. r. and or d. v. d. player  
yeah  
okay um what about the you know how we used the <unk> the digital pens the projector stuff like that  
once we get the hardware  
um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods  
right okay  
mm-hmm  
so  
yeah regular chip  
right  
well ah <unk> forgot to insert the minutes but it's about the same thing we discussed before  
also like a baseline yeah  
<unk> <unk>  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
yeah  
i don't think so  
well  
or  
yeah well it has to it <unk> it has to fit the the <unk> television and d. v. d. set we are going to sell  
i've seen that before  
um  
right  
um  
so you will be on the bahamas  
ah sod that  
oh i see right yeah  
okay back to this meeting  
it's very fancy i think  
yeah  
yeah  
the shape of a banana is not  
hmm  
okay  
we use something like l. p. a linear prediction envelope  
it's a hedgehog  
line width and uh colour  
but but you still need to run all the nets no <unk>  
i if he can give it you know like because the problem is you gotta have an immediately when you discover a bug in that  
and then we're ready  
yeah  
oh  
correlated topic models  
yeah  
you want any idiot to be able to use it  
okay i will uh  
and you find that works quite well  
okay  
yeah  
so we're we're not gonna have any sort of display i think uh  
yeah i believe so  
there is i have one question  
yeah  
pedro can have it  
yeah  
so why not give it a function  
the <unk> <unk>  
something i'm going to  
mm-hmm  
desktop  
i hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting  
hmm  
very much so  
um i've one more slide before we close but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things  
yeah  
no  
the hash table  
there are more people who like speech recognition than an l. c. d. screen  
<unk> oh i mean the oh never mind  
so you need that you need uh the x. m. l. <unk> so it's video name  
uh-huh  
we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far  
um channel settings  
you have an <unk> at home  
yeah  
yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext  
yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour  
here's the additional points i just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments  
in this case we wouldn't be doing how much it tells you about another word  
lounge meeting  
the the  
see  
yes  
do that  
yeah and  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
you received something  
we have very little options furthermore for the  
triple r.  
that comes at an ideal time for you then  
the chip on print includes an infrared sensor so we don't have to worry about that  
it's alright  
but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic  
so it's easier to convert that segmentation directly here rather than now ugh you know  
this says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer  
oh sure  
so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in  
alright now with that over and done with our next step is to see if we are under budget  
and  
which ones uh  
yeah that's what i have as well <unk> rose so  
i thought i'm not going to spend <unk>  
yeah  
sure  
do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation  
yes  
but i you know i it's a possibility  
okay  
you did the research  
but it's the board decision  
no no no  
i'm not sure how the legs should go but  
but i have one alright  
we get more salary if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half  
so  
now we've both marked line ratios here  
well then why don't you just press the up button  
that's cool  
hmm  
<unk> you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
i guess  
so i thought he said there wasn't very many  
mm  
i think but  
thing  
but  
ah okay so the okay so the here is an image number  
so we have to focus on those three thing three things  
yeah  
so remote controls in in catchy colours  
yeah  
uh indeed  
yeah  
i'd say so  
<unk>  
which takes uh in some uh space and the batteries can be located over there so uh  
so one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product  
showing that the signal is being sent  
okay cool  
um also  
and with a special colour  
uh no  
yeah  
the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better  
and then you al you add com some complexity to the signal in order to recover the error  
mm  
yeah  
no i think uh well you'll maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here  
third part uh i don't remember which is not very good  
as you said you know don't make it too hard for the granny  
or a double curved  
it's diva  
uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape which is curved in three dimension  
like it  
but we <unk> we of of course we will  
see about that thick  
yeah  
or what is the re reason of what a boyfriend huh  
i mean that what you are <unk> that's what the design  
okay so now is your responsibility to say i cannot find time  
yes well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept  
i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons  
yeah  
it was a discussion rather between people  
yep i'm fine with that  
i dunno it's uh that's more <unk> uh um  
what's the function of this button  
yeah  
yep  
then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target <unk> <unk> of twelve point five uh uh euro  
because there will be additional components which which uh will be used  
yeah  
why it is one  
yeah  
that's fine  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i think we're a good team  
yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually it's not so easy like this one the normal  
yeah  
double curve  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um so what about so the case we talked about  
if if you <unk> think that <unk> <unk> there's maybe a th thirty percent chance you're wrong or or more  
um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting  
so it a <unk> word only gets a value if it's above a certain threshold  
yeah that's what i was thinking the a slide because then you you don't have to put the hand  
so  
yeah it could could probably be in the same file i don't know  
mm-hmm  
that was uh  
yeah  
just what i think of when i think of a remote control  
uh and they also filled in a questionnaire  
back and okay yeah  
a smaller <unk>  
but am i the only one or uh  
i mean if  
yeah  
um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell or in the material that we could use for our outer shell  
so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now  
or ma yeah  
yeah  
well the working design that's my uh  
so <unk> so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any <unk> any medical background we can find out about this  
yeah  
'tis big number  
i introduce to the world the amazing  
two  
well so far only seen tool tips of few words length  
okay so  
i uh  
yeah i <unk> i know uh from a few years ago it it it costed hundred <unk>  
it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls but uh  
like eject we don't need and some other buttons we don't need  
yeah  
yeah  
uh so i was <unk> observing an improvement as i was increasing um like the um the context  
oh that's  
huh  
so it works it doesn't work  
so it sounds like you've got a lot of possible ways of getting what time you need  
but if you get it well before the next meeting  
just just small  
it's hard to tell from just the <unk> but  
it's uh a kind of secret language  
we're gonna use chunks for something useful  
because um barbara was showing the low level  
whatever  
the buttons  
uh because that little utility um does things like <unk> well but you can tell it to what to do with blinks  
do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine  
but since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality  
or you need to get the user to plug it in  
so  
you know i i want everything and then i'll decide what i want  
yeah  
so the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have  
for the user interface designer which is hamed um  
yes  
yeah  
and uh  
for the menu  
i mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in  
ah okay  
okay  
yeah  
so indian elephant is having one bump i think and the african have two  
i i'm going to make yeah <unk> okay  
we did manage to do that or oh no we really forgot about that  
but it mi it might be worth just checking what software they are using 'cause it might <unk> it might create outputs slightly different from x. fig  
yeah  
put it colours  
blank  
the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and  
very good  
<unk>  
for example um  
sure  
yeah there was this microphone as well that you  
yeah airbag  
yeah  
mm  
hmm  
g. b. h. c. ooh  
uh  
yeah  
<unk> the plus  
but it varies over time um depending on emotion  
a hippo  
yeah  
yeah there yeah yeah  
okay  
to some extent we could just cut this videos to keep it and to be able to replay it uh later on and so on  
or what what would be the shape  
i was just wondering if it should be like flatter  
it won't just be a pixel  
we have this and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like <unk> in the shape of your hand  
so better you than me  
uh  
that that's th that's the order  
oh  
mm  
a battery in it kinda  
is that right  
it <unk> doesn't have to go back all the way to the s. node  
to yeah yeah  
uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group  
yes  
um i don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all  
like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the <unk> the cushion pads around it are in another colour  
and then yeah yeah and then on top of that g. d. f. can also it will also have information such as right  
there you go  
this is what i'm going to present here  
okay  
cheers  
mm not really  
you know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th  
so the volume is you just scroll but then once you flip it open okay  
um i'll go over what we went over last time which shouldn't take long  
i don't know if you picked up your email but um the <unk> the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost  
need it to be okay  
so as we all agree to accept under certain conditions the prototype we'll have look to the final <unk> financial view  
mm-hmm  
what do we need  
oh if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen no the one to the right of that  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> here we got uh the basic functions the the arrow uh yeah button  
i think it will be a little more difficult but not too much  
it's a couple years off at least  
yeah yeah  
well  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
yeah colour will definitely be a factor  
mm  
yeah  
first you can save the documents  
yeah true  
or then again you have a channels volume and all the stuff and what a  
like you're holding your telephone  
how did we work together and what are the results and how happy are we with those  
um  
mm and some interests from the from the age groups  
it <unk> it saves us four euros and it costs us two and a half  
is there any time for a cup of coffee  
but would it still like would we still in the logic of it still have continuous i. d. <unk> if we say we take just just one meeting  
why  
six  
um this is the opening then we will get i will hope we will get acquainted to each other  
so we have three presentations and i think we'll go in  
that's it they can take it with them  
so if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype  
that can't cost much  
okay  
the big question that i'm concern here is what's the relationship between utterances in multi party meetings  
but um i've only just got the notes  
they come in and go eat everything in sight  
yeah  
well i think that is the user  
chunks representing the individual meetings or some  
so we really can't chase that  
so we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way  
yeah  
mm  
yep  
it's just it's a beautifully controlled situation  
so why not just steal nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your i mean those cost hardly anything i think and people could even spend extra money  
okay  
hmm  
so  
right  
sorry  
ah okay  
okay  
<unk> so any any questions  
well the we're gonna get <unk> sorted out this week and then it's concentrate on the on the <unk> <unk> the g. d. f. stuff  
so  
cool  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
if you have them on uh i can uh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
signal for las final five minutes  
well let's see  
i think that's a pretty good guess though  
and that definitely is a <unk> feature on its own then 'cause it doesn't even say lyman alpha forest clouds  
but it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience and then to  
yeah  
or  
can we turn off the microphones  
you can look at the final report 'cause i have to record everything we are deciding and such so i'm trying to write it down between everything else  
oh okay  
no okay  
so you think that uh  
well <unk> <unk> what what's the <unk> so th this is <unk>  
even if you are not a good drawer like me  
nice  
yeah  
yeah but maybe like if it can't really <unk> you it will be really annoying it's better  
mm-hmm  
three  
but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote  
oops  
'kay  
and it represent a nice task that can be measured that is clear and  
we were going to use that  
mm  
uh yep white dwarfs is a source type  
you put it on <unk> on the couch table  
well i think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then  
we have audio  
but i trust that she would jump in if i was so okay fair enough  
that's two out of three  
that's for the  
yeah  
uh oh okay and then you just then you just do the inverse f. f. t. or whatever  
yeah they're yep  
yeah  
okay uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user friendliness is a is a <unk> priority in this case or  
<unk> he's <unk> it both temporally and across the spectrum yep  
mm-hmm mm-hmm so  
okay  
right  
ah those those account managers what do th <unk> what do they know  
okay  
if you look at all your frequencies for example uh zero to four <unk>  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
not only like this but it has to be exactly  
okay  
exactly that's exactly what those are for  
what's a hand dynamo  
that's that's the problem  
or it would be better  
it is not a fat cat  
are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product  
okay  
so when you just leave the device in a in a light room it charges itself  
mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the l. c. display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a l. c. d. screen and then there you can <unk> you can use that as buttons  
yeah  
i <unk> said so  
mm  
um  
uh i'll start off then  
maybe you can uh point them uh  
okay  
yeah  
oh no no not at all  
i <unk> i can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll wheel with a button on it  
but i think once people get used to it i i do like the idea of the scroll wheel though  
was she was that a like <unk> <unk> real definite i'm starting a new sentence here  
it fits in your palms  
yeah  
i mean they are expecting something around ninety eighty seven or uh something like this  
um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what what the type is  
three or four millimetres  
and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing  
even if not marked  
maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it  
mm-hmm  
no  
right so we can either adjust the eye <unk> track data or we can actually chop the audio signal to take off the first whatever however many seconds  
yeah  
f. five  
that's everything from me  
it's for like the ultimately lazy people who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote  
well we have reduced the keys actually you see  
mm  
i don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote  
they are not too small you know you know you need to <unk> to know what you're doing  
to say that we've  
oh so the spec to the other conversation yeah  
lines from ions  
so uh can you go one page down please  
i think it's extremely functional i'm gonna give it a one  
and  
bit bit arbitrary  
it's just i'm just fiddling with the play doh and i'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool  
um  
yeah it is useful but  
instead of having many switches <unk>  
oh  
okay  
but then would be easier to lose  
thank you  
mm-hmm  
oh no this is just one big document so you can leave that wherever it is  
wow  
i'm not sure all the wires are really great though  
as well it'd be <unk> the gimmick factor for the younger people  
right yeah  
then uh teletext would also be <unk> impossible  
mm-hmm  
well what <unk> what was exact what you got on the on the new component  
but you still have to know it's a remote and not another  
okay  
so um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here  
so you're gonna be up there as well then  
do you know what i mean  
so we'll start with andrew  
this probably would be a lot easier would i really understand how they are handling the data internally 'cause then we <unk> then i could say oh  
this is not a very uh easy problem  
mm 'kay  
more of a sense that people know that this is from our company  
oh  
it can be done i mean you can't harm it so it's a perfect combination i guess  
where you can activate it and deactivate it  
oh no no  
and this output yeah as your this output uh this file is an output from the mm the software the shot boundary detection software  
so you're right there  
i have save this in the uh shared projects if anyone wants to look and i have <unk> considerable notes on the topic as well  
well i was for a case  
or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is and it's also <unk> it's the the product we've got is something that's at the i would have said the lower end of the <unk> of the cost scale  
shapes and things  
do uh are we going to introduce a multi remote control  
mm-hmm  
<unk> just with ten buttons that's the easiest  
bye bye  
most t. v. <unk> these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of <unk>  
yep  
okay  
he looks like a bong  
well they do but it's like it's not  
uh  
damn  
so so i think th three is good  
yeah  
nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over its all timed  
yes but  
so it's really basic <unk> as far as what keys are available but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different  
okay  
well you haven't been earlier have you  
be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things and that's the  
um so some of my findings  
okay  
but from the point of view uh of the design and price i would stick to i. r. <unk>  
but also it should actually affect the recognition on the speech segments as well  
yes  
it's just a matter of minimum distortion time  
um what you have to do  
exit  
<unk> i'm i'm not sure about the banana idea  
no and you uh you wanna avoid hard choices on voicing decision yeah  
mm-hmm  
um yeah go for it mate  
yeah  
don't feel <unk> into using this thing  
especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition  
how do you tell that this page because you don't know where the topics are 'cause they're learned automatically uh so  
alright so  
we hope that you find out that everything was wrong and that the potential is much bigger  
um  
yeah  
it's like couple of white pixels uh in the course of a in the course of a the course of a task  
rather than rather th  
i think most of the people are like their own posters only  
mm  
and then it was the most <unk> exotic butterfly ever and i'm like wow this is the middle of scotland in like march  
slide show view slide show  
further yes we must think uh do we stay uh to to television only  
but it doesn't have to look strong  
um  
i mean  
okay  
and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it if we want  
mm-hmm  
so we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on  
that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore  
and in fact that's what i output in uh on the yeah i think <unk> on the interface  
um  
and i i think we should have something most of the time i i lose my remote control  
the other the <unk> the problem with that in my mind i just think off hand as a as a consumer would i wanna buy that  
too expensive for twelve euro  
you know it's i a and i think you know  
yeah  
so we can put raw data or we can send a <unk> data  
hmm  
mu yeah right  
they are immediately following one another  
mm-hmm  
okay thank you  
um so having researched the existing models within the market um i found my research off the internet  
yeah i <unk> i did that as well actually  
that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume for example have the slide button on the side  
that's about like eighteen pounds or something isn't it  
um  
single  
yeah the the con the the the yeah the <unk> volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here  
we really need to get in contact with the other group and see if they want to do a joint evaluation  
yeah  
but there is no i. d. for an utterance i think  
but then you have to have a template for every channel for a hundred channels you have to be able to to recognize  
ye  
no  
yeah  
there we are  
mm  
from  
or colour schemes  
time pressure  
yeah yeah  
so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images  
but you you've got more information than uh  
it's your turn  
you can take the <unk>  
okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk> enough to i think  
no that that's right and uh i also have to think about new functions maybe buttons or something like that to control it  
it would have to be in the market  
well it doesn't but it uh  
i found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes  
so just one second when you say double curve what do you actually mean  
great presentation  
uh have there been any uh changes  
oh yeah  
just all things to keep in mind  
mm-hmm  
i think in phil's paper he does doesn't he  
yeah  
now those are that's all specific for speech recognition  
we have uh forty minutes  
that's a bit uh yeah i think  
but but how  
material we want them rubber as well probably yeah  
okay  
yeah yeah  
which is uh i would like to che say uh cheap uh meeting room or i don't know  
yeah  
uh some sort of user interface which i think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that  
mm-hmm  
that's what i have for options  
the <unk>  
from <unk> to <unk> forced alignment  
'kay  
so maybe um the multi function can be implemented in uh in our design  
is the uh is that the same as utterances that is that the same as utterances that  
no  
no it isn't  
and then for the menu um you can have a button that activates menu  
'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it  
oh  
so we want one you can pick up using <unk> or something right  
<unk>  
do you think  
mm  
uh black and yellow  
yes  
yes  
i'm gonna talk about functional requirements  
well th th th th th that depends uh  
uh so the data format translation  
and um ron if you can  
attempts to contact coach ineffective  
okay let's move on  
i'm the marketing manager  
see  
i don't know they might put us well let's just  
it's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions  
mm you're right star burst  
if you the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh which looks like fruits you know  
i say i have no time <unk> now currently i um i say some for some project you say that you don't have time  
uh same eye  
i think it's it's uh more easy to make <unk> fancy things when it's not complicated so  
yeah  
new remote  
and then  
what is the most important function aspect  
so start uh  
um the changeable face plates and the lighting up and visible i was when we were talking about <unk> losing it  
uh you you need to help me  
okay  
yeah yeah yeah  
twelve th yeah si one up one down  
no i don't  
yeah  
r. r.  
mm-hmm  
i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose i mean a million ways  
and robust uh and uh uh i have a scale of uh seven points  
yeah but we're gonna have to we really have to think i think colours is very important because it has to be flashy  
and you'd use the scroll scroll through it yeah  
okay  
costs four  
yeah okay  
we <unk>  
right  
low <unk> is a separate class of source  
yeah  
okay  
oh sorry i'm i me  
less fancy  
so we should target selling price of twenty five euro for this remote control  
if people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether  
yeah  
so it seems that it has never been a priority  
so maybe we should try doing something really simple like just displaying a whole meeting  
and i only take those um the <unk> uh that were recorded at the time where he was actually speaking  
or oh we're well we yeah  
definitely  
can i call it that  
the <unk> the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh  
hmm  
of course this was ultimately i think one way of uh if you could provide like chapters or something like this  
to which an l. e. an l. e. d. okay  
we can give them smooth keys you know  
and since you're gonna be reading it i mean it would be probably be useful if you made some kind of  
okay it's still the right thing  
alright  
yeah  
and  
i mean the the you just check all the probability that saying t. v. twenty five and just ordinary twenty five  
i have a question  
so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries they're rechargeable batteries so over the period of <unk> time he'll recover the cost  
yeah but it it i think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company yeah  
okay  
maybe if the remote control is something that <unk> you don't actually have to pick up anymore that would be a a useful feature of the speech <unk>  
um and then the company could then just use make use of this shape memory alloys to split up the components  
mm-hmm yeah or some sort of voice  
yep  
so daniel is well in italy  
where  
right but it would be kind to tell her ahead of time which of your morning sessions you're bumped  
right  
yeah  
it's quite fast right and so i think and the hierarchical thing is good  
uh  
no  
uh i'm concerned with um <unk> what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um i'm i'm also i want to point out that our motto  
yeah  
sure yeah  
it's not accurate  
<unk> and you press the centre button that's that's your all purpose select button right there  
okay  
but but he was keeping all the phase information  
and we never published that anywhere right  
i dunno why but when i was a child i i wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther or maybe yes  
and we wanna keep um i'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down  
there we go  
'cause when you use a pen you can just draw like you <unk> draw normally and you do  
yeah  
in codes <unk> you you get a <unk> a book with codes  
<unk> stuff  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
this doesn't work  
pas  
yeah let's let's do a lithium  
be good  
if they read a manual  
okay  
ah specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach  
um well that's the <unk> are you using t. f. i. d. f. for the information density  
well the technical uh there i think there are no technical difficulties  
um  
uh  
uh  
and and likewise for the double question marks  
yeah same for me  
but who really can do uh when somebody will really be able to do that  
we tend to um go to menus and then make choices you know  
ah <unk>  
yeah  
so that's pretty much ha which i had in mind  
mm-hmm  
so that's not an issue really  
the links go the other way it says if this page is about fish or in google  
um three out of four users uh zaps a lot as i uh quoted here from the uh results  
so it's <unk> way too expensive  
yeah  
yeah  
um in that like i <unk> menus there are <unk> and so how do you get back to the main menu  
i didn't knew it myself  
i just want to have so something to <unk> to to fix my my components onto that box and that's it  
uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements have you no idea okay  
my big bird  
huh  
very nice  
um maybe some other technology than infrared  
hmm  
we should make it glow in the dark  
oh yeah  
um of the of the remote control  
mm yeah  
my god  
i don't know why i did that  
i mean uh so the the major thing i've gotta <unk> got to do is get this <unk> sorted out  
oh i think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much  
well six  
but because i mean it's not zero it's just a noun  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
yeah  
yes  
uh a more modern look not plain long box style but  
and i think fancy feeling too because of the titanium back  
say about that  
okay <unk> yeah  
yep that's it  
okay  
sorry if this is boring everybody else  
do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like  
so i don't need to do anything right  
um and we can interview current users and future users  
so  
right  
uh you're  
but it is marked i think  
oh  
hmm  
my email on the  
i <unk>  
fantastic  
yeah  
yeah  
uh i mean it's kind of our design  
um i think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing <unk> <unk> there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations  
yeah  
um  
right do um  
one day after the crash  
yes  
that's the bad one  
it was last time i saw it  
and  
okay  
it's new it's it's um  
okay  
because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control  
okay  
it will give apple shape look  
no it's it's like true is one end and false is the <unk>  
i suppose <unk> but some  
after that we just have um user interface  
it's saying we are done with that and  
so no i didn't i didn't mean tree  
<unk> right right right right  
so things change all the time every year you know they they always talk about this year this is the new black  
i i watch a a film about a black panther when i was a child and i was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot  
so i think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t. v. <unk>  
the scroll wheel is on the side  
but also i might like the the similarity thing like my just my matrix itself for my stuff  
i mean how how far can you go with a remote control really  
i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable  
well it's a possibility too  
like is it just the first and the last line  
because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel and that's what you get with rubber  
and we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires  
uh ye well  
so initially the display  
yeah and why why i've got it two i don't know i can't seem to select any more however  
so you could have the name of the programme you could have um the start time you know where it's up to  
yeah they don't really want it anymore at least the new technologies  
and and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle when we have some kind of design  
yeah  
and and it yeah when it died we didn't get a new one or something  
that was basically what <unk>  
everything is lost  
let's wrap it up  
i'd say we did  
good concept  
an uh i if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside  
uh because a lot of  
hold on sorry  
one is mainly the uh from the uh agency a tourism agency  
so we  
done and then it's okay  
the phase of hilbert envelope  
mm-hmm  
um and <unk> has has multiple you know all the the  
mm  
i'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control  
and then volume has to be there  
that's going to be an optional  
mm  
<unk> a good idea  
yeah  
explanation  
'cause you have to print on them you have a background  
wow that's a  
how what what's the limit  
i have total here  
um certain restrictions do apply here though  
is the white okay  
but the <unk> i  
well it uh  
that shouldn't be too complex i would've thought  
and from ten to ten channels here  
and with no increase in the <unk> production price of the remote control  
mm mm  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah so it's yeah  
i believe the  
yeah  
yeah but if it has no function then  
and um oops  
there's uh also a number you know  
okay so <unk> yeah you have you have it in your hand and the screen is below and the buttons are in the middle  
or uh a total of four  
and also the <unk> button how much will it cost  
so it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem and that basically we don't have to have all these massive discussions of how we exactly interact with the data structure because most of our work isn't done with that data structure in memory in the browser  
and it could just stay there  
yes  
so there will be some kind of domain semantics  
on the basis that it's spongy then i'm not sure how well a <unk> wheel would work  
sebastian  
i would have thought that uh  
mm  
well  
hmm  
yeah  
um so i volunteer to do that if you like  
but yeah it's it's it  
yeah  
hmm  
did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about  
yes yes <unk> of course it's possible but you gotta uh implement it in the t. v. <unk>  
the the industrial design side  
yeah  
mm  
red continuum should be in  
plus one  
mm okay i'm gonna skip ahead  
okay  
so would it be would it be easier if there's a reference file with the actual real i. d. and the corresponding number  
the kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility  
yeah  
yeah  
something by there  
what do you all say  
that's it  
but very few words uh they represent a very little part of the word mass mm  
yeah  
someone may work on some other problem  
i think i have one more slide  
okay  
good morning <unk>  
so that's all what uh that's why why uh i'm distinguishing the two kinds of discourse here  
well what i did with the link well but this is not th exactly the same setup you would have  
uh it <unk> it <unk> uh but uh <unk> at that point they're all of it lumped all the individual <unk> as long as it doesn't move off that triangle together as a total sort of gaze gaze time on that  
you can point to the damped lyman a alpha <unk> in in the same way you can point to h. beta emission  
just when you enter you say oh oh it's real reaction  
okay yeah  
here  
there's a trend watching  
and you get get stuff from the from the computer but  
okay  
i can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote maybe small sort of fatter ones  
um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs  
uh oh the square button sorry  
yeah possibly  
you know like crossing out ideas or like if we had had like a brainstorming period  
you know it's useful but  
uh  
mm  
yeah but then it's very easy to make it also a <unk> i don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it  
i  
well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well which is yeah it's kind of new  
other design anyway we took as we took <unk> we took rubber as as the material last time  
i was very good in drawing  
mm  
so well i suppose he won't come by 'cause craig's on his desk  
yeah yeah yeah  
um i'd appreciate anyone's input but that's what i'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing  
we we keep the display  
so we agree to put the wheel  
we're going on to that later with the <unk> with the l. c. d. that means we'd need a really advanced chip  
okay how do you enlarge it so that you can have the f. f. five  
so i think before we close uh we are expected i mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our  
so might be what i can do i can give you the setup and you can you can generate from bottom train m. l. p. test m. l. p.  
well  
okay  
i thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user  
well  
okay  
but i mean  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
okay well um <unk> maybe i should write that down  
yep  
what the cost is  
yeah but i mean <unk> it's yeah but  
the lighting  
can you show me where because i'm actually not going to appleton tower at the moment  
yeah  
we'll then <unk> take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task to have to be done before the next meeting  
so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand  
right so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control <unk> you know  
do you know what i mean  
and all devices which have uh required some band width will send the data  
and the menu menu button to man manipulate the l. c. d. uh display  
so i'm uh i'm i'm constantly touching stuff on my screen i <unk>  
i'm not sure  
but we'll also have to write the the thing in that time  
okay  
power  
right we did  
these aren't i i think that it  
ah  
its the best remote ever  
well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands like um turning on and off the the the lights  
the entire windows uh  
but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway yeah  
yeah  
<unk>  
and so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy  
uh energy source chip type case type  
so it's uh just an idea  
i dunno what is it  
yeah but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed yes  
so i think cool is the key  
sure  
even if you arrange it by however you arrange it you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to  
yeah  
and one question uh your name <unk> is it with a  
i think we probably like we can leave those like i. frames and just arrange them sort of  
okay yes yes  
uh wants <unk>  
well  
we have sheep  
um <unk>  
um it's not very clear up there but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges  
okay  
it's it's uh i uh i can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device <unk> if you have to point to another device  
yeah  
yeah  
right  
mm  
from the  
okay  
and i i'm the the industrial designer okay  
but you can put it on the back on the titanium part  
yeah yeah  
okay  
if  
does that make sense  
oh  
or is it only the the piece that the eye <unk> the other person's eye track is on that's that's an object in this definition  
okay  
yeah  
come on give me some information  
okay so the findings  
this one  
so  
just to touch on <unk> my point one last time that i had brought up  
okay  
yeah okay  
um  
he  
yeah yeah something like that  
so it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need  
ah okay  
it only loads those on demand  
as far as i know  
but after you find out the back then it will be that will be the yeah  
yeah true  
maybe two  
i'm just saying we need the correct ones for th the structure that we're trying to get out of this  
no we have a product which none of us would buy  
i'm the user interface designer  
huh  
yeah  
it'll be above that  
okay fair enough fine  
uh-huh  
the  
mm 'kay  
yes  
um  
mm  
yeah  
we'll just have  
so here two  
the rationale must be design or  
mm yeah  
or say let's lose rubber take plastic  
so  
so uh i'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components  
this this this isn't a <unk> right  
mm-hmm  
think i'm just gonna put down one uh one c. d.  
okay so brightness contrast things like that and then just actual device things  
i don't think it will <unk>  
huh  
yeah sure  
oh  
you can use an eraser  
yeah  
i <unk> it isn't inside  
okay so historically it was um uh last year <unk> <unk> in uh his c. s. c. w. classes uh asked the student to design a table  
um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people  
okay then  
yeah  
yeah i think so  
be nice  
right it was function f. eight or something  
yeah  
but then he there were two possible options for uh for doing this on the ami data  
oh wow  
how are we gonna do a demonstrator next week  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
morning  
current remote controls do not match the operating <unk> of the user  
it would still be comfortable i think  
so we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um  
i'm catherine with a c.  
and you can't really tell exactly how good that is you can just get an idea that it's  
i uh thought up a name for our product  
there will now have to be two <unk> records because uh <unk> each person actually sees a different screen because of the gaze feedback  
fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons  
unclear really understanding  
yeah  
yeah that works  
um corinne is our marketing expert  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
yes  
um it's you know it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well it's actually a marketing gimmick  
yeah  
yeah use maybe you can use the board for that yeah  
'kay  
it's it's only useful if you have to draw something  
um were gonna have the volume control here  
so  
so we can move to the is there any question  
and use different colours etcetera  
the titanium might be uh <unk>  
so you can't  
okay  
yeah  
the technical end is what's actually gonna be in there but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong  
so one true seven false and i'm gonna now use the um the board  
and <unk> when you want to use the parents uh option you have to  
if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control then an l. c. d. screen may be affected by the movement  
it's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that i dunno  
so that's too bad  
uh i've got a uh email from the possibilities of real reaction  
no it ca <unk> a the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co yeah  
but are you you need to be more precise what you mean by speaker change  
can you show the next slide  
so  
talk about  
mm  
so the time code was wrong for for the different videos  
yeah  
yeah  
um okay um would anybody like <unk> like to to start by giving their <unk> um sort of quick views of of current remote controls  
so  
it does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages then you need more buttons  
yeah  
how do you say uh <unk> watched using remote controls in the <unk> lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions  
six yeah the one is uh maybe so you did it with with what by the way  
and <unk> what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control so it's  
yeah  
like this idea of um of putting together gazes from <unk>  
would we be able to do that  
you mean that  
basically uh just to get used to it i haven't tried it yet either um i'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around  
more than one  
and there's different prices according to each  
oh sorry one  
because it's such a because of the way our department is then we're supposed to sort of embrace all kinds  
i think that's  
sound  
nope  
mm  
the device itself that it was gonna be simple to make it uh  
okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the  
but only for a very short time  
no  
okay  
the final product would actually stand up yeah  
it <unk> yeah it depends on how <unk> you are personally but  
yeah well the  
the user does not have an advantage really  
uh we wouldn't say i mean those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me  
what people <unk> are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty five euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control  
but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat  
oh okay  
yeah for the front and then titanium for the back  
volume selection four times an hour  
they're dubbed micro <unk>  
on one of the  
sufficient but not necessary maybe  
yes  
right top  
if you read the manual always  
oh not the bold one  
mm-hmm  
okay thank you  
if if this is your directory you have um um a <unk> um a directory one two and three  
um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip  
nope  
alright  
okay it's <unk> yeah  
no that's not my point  
within our price model  
the <unk> now don't overlap  
yeah you think the lights are innovative  
do you want to replace existing file no  
on off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of  
the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets the right range of people right  
hmm  
i guess  
'kay i guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part  
alright  
what i did for my project i just ignored the hundred most frequent words because they actually end up all being articles and and everything and stuff  
and for a cell phone  
i al like i said i lost the speech recognition and i lost the special colour which would make this black a black and grey  
no one disk there is no problem  
by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from  
uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a <unk> and a capacitor  
and erase things  
do we have kinetic as well  
but i think yeah that will be good just to have a plan and to have some deadline in that plan  
uh <unk> how do you mean to say  
this for the wheel and then this for the buttons  
but uh the software is always available or like  
do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v. c. r. and everything  
it's  
i <unk> there are yeah the m. m. m. developers so i'm part of that but uh we could we could uh yeah it's not a problem  
g. m. m. oh m. l. p. scale <unk>  
logo  
yeah  
olivier <unk> and  
rose do you think you can give me a hand with this  
okay  
oh i see  
so at this point the um the only file that's been checked is melissa one that melissa did and that was checked by me  
well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons 'cause you're can mis direct people  
um it's almost curved like up to the main display as well  
mm-hmm  
i like  
oh i see what you're doing you're circling the one we like right  
um gabriel you're gonna be working on you know come up with the the user interface design  
mm-hmm  
so we find yourself there and now we have to calculate an average rating  
yeah  
um  
new ideas found  
okay let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation  
mm  
um we want to be modern um fun different  
no we could put this one as favourite channel for exam  
all the all the exercise books  
but you know our targets are very high means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make  
uh oh  
exactly  
okay  
but if you want to go to page seven hundred  
frequency of uh button use  
but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize  
just for the minor functions perhaps  
<unk> we're gonna <unk> supplement it with anything you know colours or particular gimmicky bits to it we're not we're just gonna go for something  
left  
i dunno  
no  
mm  
uh yeah but uh when you hear and try to use some examples with the music for example  
so then i also started with the there was a paper on uh fitting a ear model to the d. c. t. of a signal  
okay  
yeah  
'cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all  
yeah  
yeah they had their  
um  
yeah and definite  
and and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market  
and p. l. p.  
do we are we going to use um it it for multiple systems  
yeah  
that's this one  
okay  
uh-huh  
or put like stripes oh yeah yellow lights  
challenge  
i think this is gonna take about three weeks 'cause he's got plenty of reading to do  
you could work left handed or right handed i suppose  
it's a kind oh okay okay  
hmm  
yeah  
and uh give a feedback uh with <unk> on the table  
yeah  
so we kind of want the girlish  
because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data  
okay  
how many <unk> battery is there  
yeah  
like  
up down okay  
how we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not  
yeah  
okay  
it's  
yes  
oh so we could produce a dutch voice over for the same thing  
mm-hmm  
that's all  
characteristics of this this animal is dangerous  
um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control this is you know a fashion accessory  
course that'll then remove some of our our ball  
i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a four 'cause i think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it  
yeah  
would you like me to spell that  
i dunno if that'd be a problem  
'cause the case unit itself the rest of our components go on top of it  
producing this  
uh the teamwork was very very good  
oh mine's just gonna use the um hash map one in um java  
um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out right  
uh <unk>  
yeah  
and then you know come back three days later and <unk> going look look it vibrates and it looks like a banana  
well  
yeah  
you know wouldn't it be nice if you could have answers to these questions or something  
<unk> well some do i mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know sort of permanently sealed  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
you've got the b. b. c. have come up with a further six and uh there's uh i don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others  
but not sure  
true  
and he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the english word for  
and i think our budget is too low to use and an l. c. d. and the chip who is more expensive  
there is a user interface here  
okay  
i mean uh is the homing thing still the locator is that still  
it's in the project documents  
to get to that  
we could  
but i'm filling in a three  
screen is over there  
i mean  
yeah  
good morning  
i guess so  
is laughter annotated at all  
yeah  
only the television  
<unk> of course the more technology you stick in that the more it'll cost so  
i i think you it means you reverse the curve  
add an l. c. d. screen add a scroll wheel that'll be fine  
basically we have a a battery a power supply here  
this is sort of some meta level analysis  
so that was the marketing uh presentation  
for for enough time like uh you  
yes  
huh  
so once again you don't see the the complex sort of levels of interaction  
yeah  
yeah yeah oh they have to agree but  
um well hopefully it it won't anyway  
i would mark that  
push buttons that's <unk> uh i think basic  
well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know  
oh wow  
okay okay  
so now let's make sure that the coding would survive that  
oh okay  
mm-hmm  
why  
ah okay  
yes  
i don't know if it's already the case right now  
four  
what if somebody calls themselves ms  
mm-hmm  
this is strange by the way  
yeah  
to knock the sample speaker yeah  
yeah  
yeah and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy  
mm-hmm  
a little upwards  
um it should be original trendy and also user friendly  
okay  
first pilot subjects the ones who um know which questions we wanna ask  
are um what energy source we want to use whether i it is practical to use uh um  
mm mm  
um i'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product  
okay yeah yeah  
and then <unk> i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the <unk> device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more yeah  
oh yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
thank you too lord  
yeah  
what i've been asked to do is on the <unk>  
oh my  
cutest  
yeah yeah sure  
oh oh sorry  
okay <unk> but i think we'll yeah  
no it's only uh when you use push buttons it will cost that much  
um  
you two go design  
there are other types of things i wanna point out  
even if we have a l. c. d. display  
it's it's the i think the thing is so if someone just wants to turn on their t. v. and put on a channel  
also if if we were choose the the l. c. d. option would it give enough energy okay that's the just assume it takes  
yeah  
mm okay  
mm  
yeah  
and notes uh for a meeting are very strict  
so uh what are we going to do now is next meeting is in half an <unk> hour  
it's just a case of running the script  
um it's it's yeah  
uh voice recognition we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh i'll get to that in a moment  
so if they think that what is out there is ugly then yes i would say i would say most definitely  
okay  
no  
maybe if you just <unk> that one in the top right hand corner of the little box  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah the be  
um well there are different kinds of dogs but okay um  
that wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing  
alright  
i'm impressed  
yeah mm mm you can do like you can measure and you can do but he's mm basically doing some mm likelihood ratio testing  
then look  
okay  
and that  
you know report that described you know okay this what these people you know this is  
that's always fun  
what is your name  
no  
mm  
yeah so i think that anything's loading  
well  
that's  
and then functions for v. h. s. d. v. d. for example play rewind fast forward stop pause enter  
yeah  
so let's say  
and i think that's how the robot is set up to there are five five green bolts  
um it is i mean it's same as us putting on a the headphones and whatever  
um oh yeah not all of it is it on mine  
yeah  
oh okay  
<unk>  
we do almost always want to use them in exactly in parallel  
maybe  
uh-huh  
the costs are not under  
mm huh  
but shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it  
yeah  
or also that's another problem  
yeah that's what we expect to  
yeah but this is on the <unk> yeah i know  
yeah but <unk> it don't you have to like go sort of like for in a document versus the whole thing  
it's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen  
i'll go and check  
but what kind of problem  
they're these are all <unk> and <unk> but within the yep  
whereas this is just a one handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb  
you know you see that  
the <unk> <unk>  
and the screen is  
oh  
but yeah they're gonna look at the clock um and they're gonna look at they may look at completely irrelevant  
um  
there's just nothing  
okay  
he doesn't use our setup  
this is called a smart board  
but if you hold it in if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in  
do i have to <unk> taken into account or not  
okay  
well th that that is the problem  
uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or i mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that  
hmm  
um  
yes  
um unless some way it could have some universal connection to like the socket the same socket that the t. v. <unk> supplied from  
mm-hmm  
okay  
alright  
oh  
so we must uh we must bring it as if uh real reaction is uh is big company uh a <unk> company and uh it has <unk>  
yeah  
the x. fig thing's only when we come to building airplanes and new peculiar shapes  
yeah  
we were <unk> are you not  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
every time i have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity but it's it's it's the real  
you might want to display all meetings that had a particular phrase mention say  
um first grandchild arrived  
hmm  
so we we know where we stand  
okay  
i if you don't make it green then the elder people won't won't like it  
okay  
that's this is a bit of h. t. m. l. goo  
and the rest is hard plastic  
i know <unk> i discovered that when i did a quick look uh they do now <unk> they do something which is quite nice now  
right  
yeah four  
can we stay here  
they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m. p. three player like ipod  
but the idea was that it would be continuous  
what time does  
even scripts also the configurations or you do if you forget something some factor or something it's really  
new also  
um  
yeah  
it is  
it's it's not real real use for me  
um we can skip on  
uh  
not to this topic  
easy to use it seems quite easy to use  
um we'll uh evaluate our <unk> our uh production  
okay well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one  
yeah  
so but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with <unk> uh traditional batteries  
okay  
what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics  
but i i see i come on to that in the next in the next slide  
so uh a rechargeable battery  
kind of though it was really technically an evaluation of the product not the project in general  
what do you reckon bob  
okay  
no i'd just have two of them not <unk> up because it's just for evaluating the data  
yes  
mm-hmm  
it's i mean it's two to make it rubber  
yeah yeah  
i think i  
so that's five  
so harry  
everybody's agreed  
it doesn't yeah yeah yeah  
production  
and the first thing we the most likeable thing to to <unk> to skip is then probably the recharge function or something  
badger  
or  
yeah but the  
um it's certainly got novelty value  
i guess  
yeah  
relevance of three  
yeah  
yeah yeah big and clear  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
you know we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product we've ma we've got the prototype  
you know what a let is  
yeah  
i dunno  
sure  
so  
yeah  
yes yes yes you're right  
so could i just ask one question um  
medium  
so i think it's going to go to mike  
yeah you share a television or something that yeah  
okay and the buttons  
where did you go to uni nathan  
no problem  
okay  
yeah ideally  
yeah um yeah so i think we <unk> we go for something mid sized so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost  
um  
hey you know you're theme today  
yeah  
that's uh <unk> yeah  
uh a wee rabbit  
okay  
um that was it  
but i cannot  
but let's forget about it  
i see  
that's two  
uh  
right right  
price wise  
well i do think so  
yeah you don't don't get excessive about it  
yeah  
it's way  
because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage  
the l. c. d. screen alright but we should start with the power button  
so i'll give it a a two  
and i think we wouldn't wanna necessarily do this on <unk> data  
um isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or <unk> remotes where you've got a  
so it's the pink  
yes  
just like um most cell phones are  
well let's see  
it's good to <unk> everything but i think the response time should could be a lot better  
oh i had one guy one of the project managers was um he had a really weird accent and he was calling um one guy mister ed  
yeah that counts  
yeah  
so  
yeah  
yeah they should all i i stopped marking them 'cause there are just too many  
um so we can change that  
mm-hmm  
we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah quite a lot of mathematics  
which is good because we already decided <unk> your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated  
yeah  
functionality the way the mobile phones work the way the keypad looks  
sure if it looks stupid  
uh okay findings that's the point that i'm working on currently but uh so far i i was uh looking what what are the blue circuit  
ooh ooh i lost it there  
okay  
and you know i think yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yes  
okay  
and the power button  
it it was much better if if if you would have to spend a hour and a half that uh <unk> and the others spent while going with a ca uh with a bus to to the conference centre from from the the hotel that we were  
it's uh one integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button  
something like that yeah  
okay  
okay  
question is what makes those game pads functional  
oh  
i don't remember about <unk>  
si six six  
i think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost  
exciting  
we need an advanced chip i think yep  
it's not something that we wanna <unk> go into with this product  
it's an but just to know this is a lyman alpha forest cloud we're seen lyman alpha forest  
maximum is uh sixty milliseconds  
uh i will  
yeah  
so what we can see is some hilbert envelope like this  
yeah uh aesthetic  
just press the okay button it works  
yeah it should be in standby mode but  
right  
but the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for t. v. only  
well hang on though but um  
right  
yeah leadership is up to you  
um okay  
i <unk> i would give it a one  
and we have a correct agenda  
kate why don't you try it first if you can either bring your things with you i guess  
instead of going button to <unk> you just <unk> you'd <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  
yeah exactly  
so if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that <unk> it  
that's gonna be a difficult shape to  
mm okay  
it is a turtle  
yeah yeah  
trendy and of course user user friendly  
okay yeah  
thank you everybody  
it looks cool  
stop the meeting now  
uh-huh  
no it's fashion yeah  
i mean  
right is there a <unk> mm  
um i just got the project announcement about what the project is  
and do you think we could put a visitor with <unk> and <unk>  
and it is quite bright and  
hello  
so i set your mind to it  
well we won't  
like there were there were six thousand utterances that weren't used for uh the call routing side of things  
hmm yes  
there happen to be uh three stages  
a lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room  
yeah  
<unk> name  
was pretty cool tack though  
so one page will have sort of parts that are kind of similar to each other and then you move over and there's a different almost type of design or style  
well i th i tried to uh implement a picture here but it's hardly readable  
yep i'll do that today  
mm-hmm  
so  
yeah  
but  
so uh and also uh technologically innovative  
i bet  
it's not going to miss that it that the power button is not right beside it  
i'm just building a dictionary  
yeah it must be really uh innovative technical wise  
so i think we go huh  
yeah  
so they are doing some smoothing of a <unk> in two ways  
um  
so  
because we can  
<unk> so yeah  
i think that should yeah i think we all get the costs of everything  
yeah  
oh it's a jog dial okay  
i'd be tempted with three yeah  
so it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy right makes it nice so that's the essential part  
one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want  
so <unk> if you don't have the money you can't make it  
hmm  
this is my job  
um i will be uh <unk> project the marketing expert  
yeah  
so if we're doing it by a proportion then just having one point zero or something makes it very easy to always end up at the actually that's what i've currently like the current code just takes a tenth of the summary length  
yeah sure  
we can put those to the to the other covers  
mm  
well something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote which as you said you've done in fact we've probably all done  
shall we vote on it  
yeah  
but uh the d. v. d. players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi <unk> sets probably  
it's kitsch  
must be some way of how the <unk> were described or uh defined in one way or compared to something else  
mm-hmm  
okay  
would be easier  
okay  
so to give you an idea  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yep  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah  
okay  
either  
okay  
and there is only one sub shot because uh <unk> yeah  
so  
'cause i think <unk> uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um will be completed <unk> questionnaire um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and i'll put some minutes of this meeting together  
you mean this one  
yeah  
you could just have sort of well the i think we discussed having it with an english voice over or having it with no voice over and then having it <unk> just with cartoon noises or something like or you know when things break  
a lot of people  
but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of <unk>  
so current market trends  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons a scroll wheels integrated push buttons <unk> such as a computer mouse  
four yeah  
um almost there's one more thing i have to get out of the i have to make sure that this attachment will open  
otherwise it's not <unk> a remote control  
mm-hmm  
um <unk> no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range or are we kind of middle to bottom  
well there maybe another tool available  
then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh real reaction  
right  
two videos are turning on  
i no i i think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost  
that's but then if you're buying the remote separately but <unk> you could have something  
uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case  
no but i that's the thing i i don't think it's necessarily the other end  
because i mean gave all the secrets away  
mm  
mm-hmm  
i think there wa uh the reading les <unk> papers are very good  
you don't wanna give 'em the specification you know 'cause that's in too high <unk> a language  
yeah  
um just including all the things that we talked about  
okay  
oh yes  
mm-hmm  
um  
um up tune one way tune the <unk> i i dunno i dunno possibly  
so yeah  
if that translates to eighty percent like if if those actually translate to to really like their percentage scores then that would be good  
mm-hmm  
i think i th i think it would have been i would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double curved case  
try to translate that  
um there's a there's an important thing that you know people use when you know when you're filling up your home you know  
that was impressive  
how we used it if we were able to um you know use our creativity with the information  
this should be green  
i think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions  
one or two another two  
so i'll check that out uh to see if it really is a problem or not  
shall we try  
i think it is yeah  
and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks you it just gets annoying because it's so big and flashy  
yeah  
then <unk> we  
yeah  
good teamwork  
yes  
uh it looked a bit clunky  
sounds good mm-hmm  
so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones  
but this is this is made by a programme done outside <unk>  
and then third and <unk> less important than the other two there should be an ease of use as well  
but the trouble is that still doesn't guarantee that it'll appear because if you get enough of them that are high scored it prefers the first ones it sees  
uh <unk> but actually my segments are not always the same as their segments because and their segments there are um pause um pauses sometimes  
what do you mean define  
the real remote  
<unk> yellow yeah definitely  
mm mm  
but it's a region though isn't it  
exactly  
no  
anything about um the look of the uh remote control that you might have ideas about  
yeah  
um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels  
it does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes  
and then <unk> but you've got the space for it to stick it on  
so i guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the  
do you also vote  
hmm  
'kay um my name is <unk>  
new ideas found  
yeah but um i think for some annotations um an <unk> ca utterance can have several um types  
then we'll put it back in the group directory  
yeah that's that's a problem  
trend watching has a later date there  
yeah  
so but can it get lost if it's such a thing  
well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room like a <unk> t. v. and a d. v. d. player  
orders  
well i'm i'm i'm <unk> try i'm making sure that the g. d. f. format we've got at the moment will <unk> will output say well i've output old analysis that that robin's looking for  
i like the elephant  
i think for this meeting um there were um what was it like <unk> around si or ninety annotated agreements or yeah <unk> agreement dialogue acts  
i guess you two are on <unk> duty or whatever  
i think we need to concentrate on the you know the major usage of the th of the control which is you sit down  
well the <unk> whatever whatever you're getting out of the <unk> <unk>  
perhaps we could just try to cope  
like ten plus five plus one plus one minus or something  
yeah then you just have to do function f. eight and it should come up  
so  
oh yeah  
and uh from from this kind of if information you can uh let's say have uh a finger print of the user to know uh if this is the same user speaking  
with a very small legs  
so we might still have some problem here that it's not stopping at the end but so dave  
oh  
mm-hmm  
that's my bird  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so i believe uh we are close uh to two  
it might be trendy to some but i'm just not swallowing the fruit  
'cause that's the uh the biggest expense there right  
it's open already so you can use to  
yeah  
yeah  
it could be the other side  
for instance uh sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
on the remote control right  
yeah  
mm yeah  
so uh we decide what it's gonna be  
what's the next  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to  
losing time losing time  
yeah  
um  
but it's just an idea  
oh  
yeah  
and something like an l. c. d. screen  
yeah  
'cause i know like we're going back to <unk> again <unk> the whole spinning wheel  
oh yeah  
maybe a  
the conceptual specification of the user interface  
yeah uh when you see that <unk> the discussion is completely <unk> disconnected with respect to this some way uh it means that it's happen in something different than before  
yeah yeah  
i let david jordan do his presentation  
so i don't know how it went like usually while as soon as one disk fails it should be replaced actually and uh i dunno  
well i i didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way i think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and  
that's my <unk> that's my presentation  
and each band is then processed independently  
so so th th there are like li the thing these standards  
no the the the there's there's very small graphical bugs  
okay  
well  
i i th  
it's a fresh colour  
yeah  
yeah so  
hmm i think it's all there  
i think it's important  
but if you have a normal on button on the on the remote then you do the on and then you search the channel which you want  
yeah i think that given the list of materials i <unk> i was forwarded it's that seems doable  
and that one  
okay uh in fact i didn't understand that  
yeah  
just i think it's very representative what we drew i guess  
i mean obviously you it'd have to pick which one to synch the clock to  
yes it could be  
uh well skip this  
mm  
marketing expert  
but if they have these scroll wheels so um you know what other buttons do we want  
and uh  
the must have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel  
like that  
i'll use this uh same sheet  
um uh like i said here um  
well they are used four times an hour so  
oh yeah i <unk>  
that's easy to do with the colours i think  
well i i've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward <unk>  
'kay  
one that probably makes the code a lot more readable for everybody who's playing around with it  
yeah mm let's say i am uh on channel eight now  
yeah  
well we have to i think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be  
i wish i'd had my camera  
no but except for the design of the surf  
this is gonna be flat  
in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original <unk> briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within  
yeah  
whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen things like that all the more complicated functions of menus  
yeah  
so if we can just move on to the next slide  
it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that i haven't got and uh  
hmm  
well you only have to power it up when you wanna use it  
okay  
no no that's what they say like you do it then send it the hard disk then they will say okay we can do it  
so i can i can say already  
yeah if uh  
well not perfect but okay  
you just click okay okay okay you know that's not a mistake and then you might miss a real error  
that's quite reasonable  
like if you try even models also i guess if you change  
you have all the connections to between all the words like hmm  
i don't do  
that would help us um you know nab a good number of those uncertainties  
cool  
it does look very cool  
or make it uh a fucking two  
'kay it's my time now  
uh i have  
we start with the data path  
see mm how are we a good team  
um  
mm-hmm  
that's only for the titanium  
that's right  
definitely not  
yeah  
no you should send it to the <unk> to the folder first  
well  
what would i like  
and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use in fact they don't even know how to use them  
uh can i have  
well right right  
yeah  
yeah okay yeah that's yeah that's okay  
uh i think it's quite interesting but only annoying thing is this multiple sessions  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
do you think we need to how long do you think until we need to meet again  
but but ease of use was not very important may i remind you  
um  
alright it's all all systems go  
yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
or is there anything we'd like to discuss  
the first time yeah but after it's it take okay  
whatever  
and as you saw as you saw in the email i sent uh okay  
um well <unk> <unk> we can still discuss that  
i think my last presented what is going inside so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it  
ah and uh  
huh  
different colours also  
a bit bigger i guess but  
um the thing is like you can only burn from the local file system  
and then start thinking about how to given 'cause i mean i guess especially 'cause this is a this is a more of a commercial based project  
i've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about  
this <unk>  
because if they do all the time the same gesture as you said previously in the last meeting maybe they will get injuries because of that  
well  
mm-hmm  
it's not much  
i mean maybe design something that's sort of like uh i suppose not everybody's everybody's <unk> the same but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier  
yeah  
um so  
so um  
um okay if you <unk> go over to uh the integrated circuits  
and second there should be some technological innovation  
mm-hmm  
i dunno what uh you were talking about but  
okay yeah i mean it's not it's not too hard to do  
th <unk> <unk>  
yeah  
a little tail maybe  
so they may well have a yeah  
formats formats yeah  
but  
yep  
yeah i do  
so we are dealing now with three  
yeah  
oh i was <unk> i was suggesting that <unk> it be uh instead of our  
um  
so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of d. v. d. players you know like forwarding goes differently  
mm-hmm  
oh i see  
just say l. c. d.  
and the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned  
oh no you mean in the <unk> distance  
and out  
i mean it had the at the <unk> at the leaves they had the well she didn't show it but they would have the semantics of the utterances  
oh right okay  
yes  
um i have some points i would like to uh some some issues i would like to point out  
yeah it must be must be a gadget to have  
yeah that is true  
so that's uh is that is that the advanced chip  
i think yeah  
um they're just the the very basics you could use for a t. v.  
okay  
and uh the the is calling this uh c. uh <unk> and it was used with m. m. m. server with pierre a and the beginning when yeah  
i <unk> i was thinking but i <unk> i'm not sure now  
whether we do that through a query where we say give us everything that's ab above this and this weight or whether we skip the same infrastructure  
okay cool  
so what we have is you have i think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost  
and in <unk> of um these these more argumentative things  
we're not sure about the size anyway just a general design  
and i maybe it's not clear enough to mark  
okay  
we want the whole thing in there  
mm  
we are using just <unk> gaussian windows  
line centre you can point to  
well we have a power button  
mm-hmm  
just noise or just those impulses  
mm grapefruit  
well the only problem i can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls  
yeah you you don't you don't grab it you you  
what do we think a good size would be for this  
oh yeah it's too late three months  
okay  
and they should be long lasting not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use  
four millions  
well when okay  
'kay  
hmm  
mm <unk>  
can't remember the <unk>  
yeah  
yeah <unk> yeah yeah you take the the d. c. t. and you just divide it into several sub bands frequency bands with a different uh  
okay my bad  
uh hard rubber i think  
um yeah use that thing you can go back previous  
yeah  
uh in five six months abou approximately  
<unk>  
uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing what your what your role is um  
yeah  
yeah  
it's four <unk> it four units  
yes  
yeah  
what do you think  
so with that i think it's best if i hand over to you  
you just click anywhere  
yeah  
um what was with the chip on print  
so the reason we're here we're gonna design a new remote control as you probably all know  
yeah the universal ones  
but um let's see what be handy to do  
yeah yeah  
uh you can't really see it that well but this is the l. c. d. screen  
okay  
or vice versa so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different  
i'll look into that  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i don't think so  
with different  
a all kind of colours  
let's actually just see if maybe k. right  
drawing or  
you must still have it open  
mm  
right  
uh  
mm-hmm  
but i just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that  
so the the first group is bigger  
yeah  
um 'cause that's it's not hub  
<unk>  
which may not be a great idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead  
yeah we need to <unk> de we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote  
the cost of the thing can be made more than might be  
without affecting the circuit board  
yeah  
yeah it gives it  
yeah  
you just adjust it with these two buttons  
yeah okay  
drawing on the fashion trends at the moment uh fruit and vegetables um  
some uh audio signal  
um  
like my the info that i got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own because you're gonna do the market market uh <unk> i'm supposed to do the little work on the year end report  
hubble  
so we we <unk> so we pay for it and  
yeah  
attractive  
alright  
but you'll know when the real experiment you'll know the relationship between that and the eye tracker <unk>  
but but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then  
but i don't think you'd particularly class them as a separate source  
mm so  
but <unk> wouldn't we want to actually just like dedicate an afternoon or a morning to being a poster session  
'kay  
i <unk> well i mean i because i can i can say for how many frames this fixation went is officially defined  
i think the information gain in rainbow is ordered by the value of the information gain  
is it  
well the the fancy colours and uh and so on and still have the ease of use because we have an easy interface  
uh that's no longer an option it has to be an advanced one now  
um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point  
fire the accountants  
yeah  
okay  
uh but uh given the current uh material we have um mm given your activities because i know that you both are involve in many other things  
now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary  
mm-hmm  
so you will have to work on the look and feel design to have the easy to use  
um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market  
mm  
yeah just don't even point it so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that  
oh yeah  
we probably will  
no not for that one  
so if that <unk> command is s. s. h. again and if you that would require that you have all your key files set correctly  
yeah  
so these these were the component selection and these things  
okay  
yeah  
um  
<unk> excuse me i forgot my  
at least my t. v. is a is a compartment which you can press  
yeah so that kind of decides your whole chip thing  
we had <unk> uh no no no no  
you will have as the i. d. i don't remember what is <unk> industrial designer to put um <unk> yeah  
uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy  
yeah the the the front <unk>  
yeah we <unk>  
so you need to record the channels  
like the internet you can send emails and you've no interaction  
this are usual functionality  
right  
excellent  
so i think it should be the same as that  
um  
well uh what i found was that a senior um  
that one  
so  
yeah  
should we change that <unk> that that's a one if not or not  
ah  
and then there are corpus um based um how may i say it works so yeah that is one possibility for example finding the connection between different meetings  
no  
okay  
so so long as i've got something that will output s. v. g.  
the next on well i can just sing about  
okay  
well we've got we've got like one curve here  
sorry  
uh it needs some uh some yellow uh  
yeah  
no  
regular sorry  
in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh  
hmm  
i just ordered  
hmm  
yeah  
so like the diva project is a tape free already smart meeting room huh  
well uh did trying to really determine the um the um uh subject of something for my proposal i mean  
in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in <unk> in bags industry  
we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip  
okay  
uh i don't get it exactly  
you'd just get one mould  
hi i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer  
well maybe <unk> we could uh <unk> on um some uh calculators you have lo those little little l. c. d. th that you can click on or something  
true  
okay th  
well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements  
so the more less important  
mm mm four  
mm  
it's going very fast for me actually  
power consumption should be about the same  
<unk>  
maybe it's maybe there there there is something th <unk> most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control  
yeah  
so and then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch  
six buttons we have to have six buttons  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um  
'kay  
mm  
mm  
yeah  
do do you agree  
yeah  
yeah who <unk> who would have the money to spend  
hmm  
'cause we'll never have more than two and we'll never ha well we'll either have one or two  
i thought it might be a cat  
yeah  
so maybe it's just doing it randomly at the moment  
but is something that's seven centimetres square <unk> easy to hold  
no  
why not  
yeah  
uh  
so hmm  
which gives us an average of three  
let's do it then  
but pictures of fruit vegetables vegetables  
okay i have also some points uh  
um so i've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um  
the uh uh mm  
yeah again like uh no the problem is different for everybody  
yeah i was thinking of that also with with a with a uh arrow  
excellent  
alright  
yeah  
yes because i can't even see mine  
uh for to make it faster we should <unk> it run maybe  
<unk> you all know l. d. a. or yeah  
yeah  
which are um features that made the clustering that can be extracted even if the clustering it's always different  
<unk> and we <unk> we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers so we should think about  
yeah  
we wouldn't call it threshold we would sort of like the <unk> of decision or something like it  
yeah  
um yes but uh yeah i mean one segment of theirs is sometimes two segments of mine that's just what i meant  
can you not do that  
i know  
um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight  
um  
yeah  
this is the tandem  
but you know there's x. m. l. and x. m. l. and you know  
oh okay  
hmm  
you know  
well it's not um the the extra cost of having these as attributes is not high  
the case uh the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do um there's there's the shape of a case  
i didn't uh say it in my presentation  
but if it's a r. r. it would be real reaction like if it had a symbol on it  
okay yeah well  
a lot of uh  
okay  
yeah  
within th within the topic so like topic we had to when you say topic  
separately  
right  
hmm  
so they do mean iron line  
fully agree  
i guess  
right and <unk> speaker at the back or something  
um we have already all the data that is on the graph  
i don yeah  
well the other problem is uh <unk> has to be manually launched on both machines separately  
and you have some slides then  
i mean you don't need to use both hands one hand to hold this and type in with the other you can just use your thumb  
mm  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
we'll have to buffer it  
um and we'll get on with it  
yeah i don't think that should go in  
and you can just put p. g. c. at ling dot and just do it that way  
is it possible  
yeah  
but we clearly only need th the main buttons although uh if clearly only need the main functions  
yeah  
um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting i have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared <unk> drive at this point  
the uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing it would be still do we know if that's an option technically right now to that  
jasmine i thought you just said that you'd uh looked at extracting the text  
so we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the t. v. device  
and again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own but this just backs it up  
uh  
that if it's a very long session for each twelve point five frame you will actually get the same segment now  
it applies  
'cause we can't lose the battery  
yeah it's it's a <unk> it's a very simple simple <unk> it's basically just whatever the average of <unk> mean square differences from the mean or something  
you know  
oh no  
yeah  
yeah  
but if uh it's ordered by information gain i don't know where the words come from because it's it has a bag of words representation  
um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room  
so that's it  
yeah that's voice recognition so  
on the shot  
yeah yeah this in different colours  
but i <unk> was kind of surprised that those meeting actions  
so can you ask um d. f. k. i. whether they can give us a couple ami meetings run through their h. p. s. g. process  
um  
uh  
yeah  
whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything depending on what menu you're in  
trendy <unk> and i say specifically spongy fruity  
broad line emission  
whatever new functions that we need to do um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger basically  
<unk> but still doesn't solve the problem of saying what i yeah yeah sure sure  
um that's that's how it works  
well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold <unk> for both hands  
yeah well i just  
um but then again the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television  
okay  
this one yeah  
different uh functions on the board  
where um one is i've broken the pen again  
yeah  
okay  
mm  
yeah we keep the flip  
yeah okay  
i dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow i kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the r. r. in it somewhere on it  
three  
uh you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television so you need buttons to change the television angle the camera angles and stuff like that  
alright  
have to if we just lengthen it i guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there  
yeah  
now now  
it could be like <unk> had the assembly like maybe fifteen euro  
okay all set  
yeah  
no user <unk>  
so is there any reason why we <unk> don't do that  
the fancy colours  
so  
oh half a fruit  
right  
okay  
so so <unk> when we <unk> a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition  
mm-hmm  
yeah i thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to  
but i'm now did <unk> did you work with the same prices that i have here  
so you can look at redwoods <unk>  
it's worth to buy  
mm  
<unk> for jogging and that those kind of devices gaming devices should define the characteristics of the device  
yeah  
but do we have to we'll work together but do we have to stay here or do we  
okay  
but you would say as a contents from the content level  
and then you uh hey there there's remote control  
um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing  
then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age sorry age groups  
you know  
yeah  
what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done  
so um but in my uh you know i mean they <unk> that should be if  
so any other suggestions or functions  
okay  
right right  
you feel okay  
well we'll keep this in mind and then discuss it later on  
and the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip uh scroll wheel and l. c. d. is an advanced  
or you you or you send it to me  
when you want to go <unk> move up you just scroll up and click on the button  
yeah right  
so i don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote <unk> you know like we just had two components  
yeah  
um i <unk> i i'm getting quite lost um at the moment because um <unk> what's um our difference between the um se um uh the importance measure and the skimming  
yeah but i <unk> don't you guys set up for isn't block booking more appropriate  
i think because i have two televisions at home  
oh that  
um okay great  
you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require you press the middle of the scroll  
points  
flat  
okay  
or just like basic product <unk> positioning the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london  
yeah  
and when you have a particular menu uh at your device uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t. v.  
yeah  
channel settings  
thirty one oh no it's twenty eight this  
so then yeah then it's not exactly amplitude <unk> or it's it's in between maybe  
<unk>  
uh this is uh i just want to to describe here the bus  
it is useful and in in in in in in in um <unk> in being creative  
well but it's still then uh the the long box  
what are they gonna be next year  
okay  
oh that's funny  
but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
alright and the next is does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables  
i think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long because i don't know how how many points there are but uh yeah  
yeah  
i can just like <unk> <unk> i can sit together with you for twenty minutes and just show you the entropy code that i wrote for my other project and it probably and we should work together because it's we used <unk> we have to we'd use the same matrix as i'm using in my latent semantic analysis  
uh yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
you <unk> you already told that  
yeah  
i think high excitation should be in because it's just saying  
no i don't think we have  
okay that's just super  
either that or another  
it does work but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh  
uh it was under a different name  
so  
yeah  
yes commercial phone  
yeah  
so is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are  
but uh it looks and stuff it still uh it's not it's not really eye catching except for the colour  
so  
uh well  
yeah 'cause i mean the <unk> reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it  
and uh we have three of those uh actually just uh menus with sub menus with or sub items sub functions  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um low <unk> th they're low <unk> aren't they  
mm it's impressing  
yeah  
we could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision  
uh one thing that i didn't include here that i forgot that we talked about last time was doing um some sort of lock uh function  
okay  
okay  
the personal preferences for the young people they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow uh strawberry red and stuff  
<unk> you know instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you so you don't have to look for the channel you want  
opening a word document now  
yeah but i mean people like  
okay  
so that should be simple  
they are jointly building up an argument structure  
yeah  
and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert  
the market trend of fruit and <unk> mm spongy uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy  
so you could perhaps use it to match um it with your additional information you got couldn't you  
yeah on the backside  
so maybe we can  
yeah maybe even i mean that's sort of that depends on how how advanced we get  
mm  
yeah  
we'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design  
so it's unrelated it's not that right  
okay that's that's it from us  
uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design  
uh uh it's not it's not that i was very productive that i was doing anything useful  
a lapel is also there  
yeah  
this is it's  
okay  
yes uh-huh  
yeah  
the password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem  
okay  
so people can indicate would they prefer to give a poster or a talk  
mm yeah  
so they supply few voices  
and a special material  
so  
mm nobody has any idea about that  
but but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years three years with with <unk> two batteries  
mm-hmm  
you were saying something  
does that include charging circuitry and everything  
some nice poor country and  
hmm  
have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the t. v. and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are  
yeah  
so my outline is something like introduction and experiments the results conclusions  
can we afford that  
yeah  
no no no  
yeah  
so  
okay  
hmm  
yeah you have a two he has a two  
mm-hmm  
just a sec  
because i think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that  
more efficient and more robust system  
right  
i know  
and uh  
okay  
so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high  
i'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes  
so this is uh first meeting of  
uh <unk> um from you i would like to see  
you can order it in any way you like but um start with the first channel and go through it entirely  
can i  
mm-hmm  
okay  
it's it's a lot easier  
yeah i wonder  
or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another elephants were very useful  
very nice  
okay  
<unk> does it make it more difficult to design  
so as far as the design goes the very most important aspect was the design to the customers  
but they had deals with people forgetting to turn the microphone on forgetting to turn it off  
yeah what i don't understand what <unk>  
something like the case if it's scratched or something you would want to reuse it  
uh yeah  
i propose a <unk> infrared base you know  
yeah  
we're good and if they're not we're going to uh re design but we have to do that uh very very quick i think yes  
alright  
did you make this questionnaire or what  
yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen  
okay  
that's the problem  
by taking inspiration from other similar designs we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control which is <unk> international  
yeah the that's even advantage i think for this approach  
uh the last one  
oh  
no  
is that enough time for you do you think  
components design  
um okay so scratch that  
for everybody to see what button it is  
zero  
it's a it's  
yeah but there are also design cost  
you you can touch options  
yeah  
oh that would definitely be my second choice  
which one  
no okay  
buttons  
but it's okay we don't have to decide about it now just as long as we remember battery type and size is important  
we're not entirely sure what single curve versus double cur  
uh i will i will make it a three because uh yeah  
users to uh add one  
the remote control is made of soft material  
no  
but it just it <unk> it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept  
yeah  
yes four points  
the other thing i mean it i mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway  
maybe that might be the  
bottom  
even if actually i remember i just made some measure uh saying okay <unk> let's look at how many words i don't have in the dictionary and are in the slides  
yeah  
yeah it's cheaper  
project manager  
yes  
yeah  
sure  
okay  
with rama  
<unk> well it's a <unk> it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it  
uh within a a segment actually within a topic segment  
well  
i think so yeah  
uh this is you  
and plastic is already in colour i think  
so that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead  
uh i think  
regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price  
a problem um yeah  
but i've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well  
a big learning curve yeah  
okay let's try to draw something  
yeah  
because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product  
uh well if it's just based on uh like a a stable fixation for so long or or something and crossing into that region  
so  
yes  
at at least uh forty buttons  
yeah but you can scratch it off or something  
you wanted to talk something different also  
you you need it bad  
yeah  
yes  
oh you can't really see that very well  
because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first  
yeah  
no  
mm  
here's uh the competition i suppose  
well <unk> i think i would actually leave it um with only th on those  
okay  
yeah  
alright  
it's a <unk> thing and uh  
do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design  
we should think of the twelve fifty we have but  
i'm afraid i'm a bit slow for this stuff uh  
just let it lie down it wont stand  
so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls  
that's why i end up sort of copying stuff into the temp directory at the gateway machine  
okay  
oh  
that's a good idea  
are we done with our meeting  
just gonna be <unk>  
in terms of retrieval in terms of indexing annotation meta data extraction  
so for that i  
the one where we current  
okay  
kinda soft but but not this  
okay  
they're very <unk> vulnerable  
i think that could be in the component uh concept uh  
um and i i i <unk> so i suppose one um  
quickly give you  
uh  
i thought they were just  
um  
that's fine yeah  
have something yeah  
yeah ten percent  
it could even  
<unk> great  
oh okay indeed  
to produce it yes  
mm-hmm  
or <unk> mystery ed or something  
yep  
and about the side view um  
okay yes okay  
and you were talking  
yeah simplification  
'cause you're half way through a thought and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump  
innovative  
it's just to give an idea  
uh round edges  
th they are gonna be more expensive but on the other hand i mean it  
we we have to  
hmm  
what is this single curved what does it mean  
bottom perhaps yeah  
absolutely  
yeah i'm i'm not <unk> clear about uh the the extra two buttons  
no i think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the that's on the buttons of the remote control and per  
mm-hmm  
so you're talking there about uh changing  
for our remote control  
right and what about um the project as a whole  
no no <unk>  
okay  
i always thought that was brilliant  
here you go  
etcetera  
oh okay i think it's a technical thing which our  
so those are the three things just not to worry about teletext uh only control the t. v.  
mm-hmm  
slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well i do don't know that they're special colour  
and um then the last one i could think of uh it goes with the latest trends  
always have <unk> the soft buttons always uh  
uh the problem is yeah is occurring not only as an agreement but really frequently as like uh an encouragement as well isn't it  
we really need to finish up here  
um i don't know how long we still have  
warning  
right  
then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting  
so we've got three days  
um so yours would always like yours would always be loaded in i guess  
yeah  
uh <unk> maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back aye  
yeah i suppose  
yeah  
okay  
oh  
pink television sets pink remote  
okay  
no not like that  
because remote control working with infra red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune  
okay  
and  
so presumably today they're now free again  
yeah if if if if you're if you <unk> if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable would you replace it with another one  
i think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together  
uh i'm not sure about the screen <unk> what is the use usefulness of the screen  
yeah  
th it's very solid yeah  
not that much  
okay  
okay  
if it works so well  
'cause as long as it stays as it <unk> keeps working you're not very motivated to do something about it  
okay yeah  
i think many of us would associate those with fancy  
mm  
yeah  
right  
that's that's that's well it's quite innovative  
so actually uh it's not that much of an increase but yeah  
alright  
yeah  
um <unk> that may be but i probably would flag it  
get a number in here  
mm-hmm  
i'm sorry  
one side for kids one side for adults  
i mean i i never touch between the buttons  
yeah  
so my point of attention is especially this part  
i've for a remote control i think it is  
ah okay  
yeah  
i hope it still works  
<unk> whether you consider g. d. f. format to be um the thing that's just the straight forward translations of what's in the original eye tracking output  
in that <unk>  
yeah th th those things are nice  
well i think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them  
and that is more expensive  
very good  
um so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that  
but uh but  
and if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice  
they like gadgets  
what operating system do you have  
so you don't you  
um it will know which pass it is but i think you'll also be indicating that as well  
um well what i found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set  
yeah <unk> i'm done  
okay  
not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll <unk>  
uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half euro  
and like <unk> basically the score that i'm talking about is a conditional entropy score which just checks how much information  
thank you  
um  
and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time do you think it will work  
it's <unk> it's just whether it's worth arguing about  
yeah  
um then the discussion maybe the time for sebastian to show his presentation  
ooh  
yeah yeah  
so if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number  
well our slogan is not very long  
i would say  
in the <unk>  
plus red which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh  
yeah  
um i think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh <unk> suggestions for our our new remote control  
we're we want to sell it at twenty five euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars  
yeah i think we need both  
mm-hmm  
um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice i. b. m. do um drag and dictate  
shall i just swap the file numbers around from now  
okay  
the the young people the young people want to be different from their friends  
so if we're gonna go with the l. c. display then that's  
<unk> push parents  
yep  
younger people like trendy trendy designs so that's <unk> we should  
so that's really uh it's maybe better than like using just random noise or  
just a sec while my <unk> comes up  
yeah we somehow always get it working but in different ways every time  
no the advanced chip is uh  
i think that would be better  
for example for the for the l. c. d. if we choose to have a small device we cannot use this um a such a a a screen  
because he is already he or she is already an advanced user  
i'll go first  
or  
uh scenario  
or and for this uh  
the problem was you didn't have <unk> data that was hand labelled for chunks  
we've developed some we've got some good advances in technology with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons  
and they won't like it  
um we haven't tried that because we are not going to have the special kind of table  
yeah yeah  
okay so i are we going to write off the l. c. d. option  
some of them  
but okay  
good  
the the utterances are numbered  
no no it's joke  
with a little bit of science uh you i will show that uh in in a few minutes  
well it'd be nice to get the thesis i think  
um i think it's supposed to be the same size but um it's got much fewer buttons  
same sort of function  
yes  
um project manager i have something to tell you  
'kay  
it might be yellow because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere  
nee  
so  
so the functional design is to identify the main user needs the technical function the remote control should <unk>  
r. three c.  
i think they are  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
should we go back to number five  
also we can be here yeah that would be cool  
i mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command because there are problems with a voice command  
it's completely different from this one  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well and uh our corporate image should stay rec <unk> in our products  
okay  
shorter yeah  
so <unk> it's not always gonna be the same colour  
so for example there's nothing stopping us  
what they cost  
for sure  
every once in a while i think  
that is true  
and and your question is how many do we have to sell  
like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it  
<unk> right  
so  
mm-hmm  
okay  
but  
and the days when there is no <unk> sunlight yeah  
so yeah fine  
so i had square buttons  
two or three  
maybe we <unk> should we <unk> i don't know if we should talk about uh how how much time have we got left  
yeah that's a  
oh i'm not hooked up but other than that completely ready  
and then i also have a standard edition which <unk> we can also choose to develop too  
damn  
there's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off  
yeah  
and so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say channel five and the thing would go to channel five  
is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and i'd like the um industrial designer to get <unk> think about what needs to be done  
yeah  
mm  
right more or less  
but buttons are standard  
okay so i guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working  
<unk> i kinda like th  
so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users they prefer to <unk>  
and so on  
and um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary  
it's one  
okay  
you have to make this titanium too  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
like then if you need something next up so like a topic segment you'd go to here  
sorry  
i don't think it's really that much of a problem because if it's too big what we can do is just well all the off line stuff doesn't really matter  
peeling of the banana you know should should discover the other buttons which are hidden  
erase  
yeah this yeah  
mm-hmm  
so have you tried marking these exchanges  
mute  
okay  
people know the  
you know goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros what they wanna make on it so  
yes  
right  
yeah  
uh  
an a. g. n.  
actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly  
alright  
and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide but it has a scroll wheel on it  
i think you're right that we we weren't gonna mark the equivalent width but we were gonna mark the lines  
well they still do it for library loans and stuff so  
bright natural colours nothing  
so let's see i was a stupid user and was clicking on this segment  
just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool  
yeah  
okay that was good  
well  
great  
okay that's fine that's good  
so you you can put some fruity things  
it's just an idea we have to find out if it's possible  
so we have to give a  
uh to go with to go with fashion and  
i only know ancient papers  
no we <unk> ca yeah we can't afford both  
it kind of yeah  
rich iron spectrum  
we can adapt only one switch suppose here like we can make two switches and if i'm left hander i use this switch to follow the main operations  
okay  
next instructions you'll get in your email  
a bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad  
so there isn't a simple way to just tell which ones the sound card machines are and just to use sound card machines is there  
so um  
i mean uh i mean uh i mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it  
so yeah  
here i have the the <unk> the <unk> of uh our  
yeah  
it's got a tail then  
everybody ready  
and the third one is the number of visitor visiting people and uh well how many of them we want to accommodate and where where we put it  
and then on the right it's a lot more simpler it's got volume it's got the play the like circle set which is play  
and monday the fourteenth for the abstract  
uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices  
if you <unk> it with two parts one that had a a ha a harder and softer spectrum hubble in hubble deep field south  
um  
like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah worked well  
almost  
that's my uh that's the agenda for today  
me too  
the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it  
and i also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case  
'cause you get <unk> 'cause you  
doesn't tell me  
and how many buttons do we have  
but too ma i i think so but  
yeah sure  
okay so it's just your your show  
right  
we're really gonna use them  
yeah  
but that was my second  
that's a good idea  
yeah yeah  
this is uh up to you to tell us  
but um i mean i think i think you're on the right track with the analysis by synthesis but that doesn't tell you how what sort of bit rates you're going to achieve or um and because you have to do it separately for each um band  
you all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions  
do we add them up and rate or anything  
yeah  
there'll be one hell of a calculation  
slowly  
i don't know if that's a good idea or maybe it's a little bit  
despite the cost it's gonna incur  
oh  
i dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting  
yeah  
okay mm-hmm  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
so not uh too formal like like uh the older people want  
younger people from sixteen to <unk> forty five um years are more interested in <unk> features like l. c. d. screens speech recognition <unk> etcetera  
right the full stream  
let's see now  
okay  
yeah  
um alright so <unk> is it function f. eight  
did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder  
uh idea that you uh the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype  
yeah  
that's all you know gone very very well and and and be you know has been good communication going on  
<unk> sort of  
yeah  
i do like the martian remote  
now in between as the project manager  
but it's it's nice because people anyway don't go there  
well that's nice  
it is  
but it yeah <unk> this is effectively what we have here though and th that directory is one clustering of the marbles  
alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t. v. but it still should meet those parameters  
well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would <unk> it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market  
oh you can actually for example if you see they are they are they are quite small over here and uh now you can  
well i mean <unk> than like yeah just a hard plastic  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
these are the lines  
yeah like fancy versus creative it's it's  
and any device we which wants to send a package a <unk> a packet sorry should ask um there is a manager of that bus  
and i think we all you know  
too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it  
okay  
thank you  
and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into <unk> and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
choose one it <unk> i mean <unk> think of it from a speech recognition point of view again  
and actually i've done quite well in s. p. one i've done it a bit worse in s. p. two because it was a <unk> a lot more challenging  
'kay  
you can uh separate the signals  
yeah  
and some remotes you can use with your thumb  
but uh just inside  
yeah  
alright yep  
mm-hmm  
your training data  
are we still thinking about this screen sorry  
yeah  
yeah it's uh yeah that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold easy to hold so you don't drop it  
alright  
but yeah  
no  
yeah  
the advanced chip was for the l. c. d. wasn't it  
one is where the mouse is and the other is where the gaze is  
so  
and you don't uh it's not <unk> or something i th i think that goes too far  
yeah  
um  
sleek little remote control with big user friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access  
how many excuse me  
uh i it has different blocks different blocks  
i can <unk> i will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage  
my my <unk> my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions  
'kay so  
and lastly we have  
yeah  
triple r.  
right  
when the t. v. dies you can play with the remote control  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
oh  
so then what he does is like he proposed uh like some like ratio test based on maximum likelihood  
can we  
mm-hmm  
sure  
doesn't really matter  
so it should be every papers then should contain all the results from nist evaluation or some standard task then  
he's hiding  
i think so  
mm-hmm  
and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like  
well  
ah um okay  
volume button  
<unk> hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough but it doesn't have a really really tough look  
yeah i'd take out red and blue  
nah  
to the remote controls on the market nowadays  
with two huge buttons  
waterproof  
yes you can put a logo on top of it  
of course uh the idea is to reduce um the band width on the bus also  
uh yeah  
also means you can drop it without damaging it  
right okay  
i'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions  
because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well  
i think we why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard  
yeah okay  
hmm  
yeah  
uh for us it's about to sell it  
um but anyway  
uh it looks like a <unk> uh uh <unk> uh a bit like a joystick  
i am the expert in marketing and i want to tell you about what people uh <unk> want and uh like and dislike in remote controls  
uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um i think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one  
you know these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control but i'm assuming you know yes  
and so personally i think that we need a modern eye catching design but it it really needs to be simple  
but  
yeah  
no actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um it can be for two purposes  
no  
yeah that's my job  
i believe it's fancy  
so <unk>  
sort of the the older group  
yep  
i think a touch screen  
yeah i'm fine with the basic battery  
yeah yeah  
so yeah activity is uh i'd define interactivity to be as a degrees of interaction in meetings  
no human intervention required  
you have to use your imagination a little bit  
okay so you can say that <unk> this frequency belongs more to this person and this one more to this one  
i i it'll it'll not be  
but i think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap  
yeah uh i think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons  
looks like a star trek <unk>  
yeah  
forty minutes in total for this  
it makes it the thirteen yeah  
oh yea yeah you design it  
so first let's uh  
or that you can click uh out uh of the remote  
may yeah  
so when you are doing speech coding or  
yeah  
yeah  
and um yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh well as we already said a actually uh familiar  
so there might be the uh <unk> speaker and he uh a hearer  
uh-huh  
yeah we don't  
it's the the the start uh starting page uh  
okay  
i know where i know where <unk> is  
mm  
hmm  
what was that sixteen  
and uh you <unk> you probably read that already so i don't have to tell you about that  
no  
furniture and all this  
'cause it doesn't really matter  
who is good in math  
or if the casing is too thick then you may not hear the the speaker  
okay matthew  
oh what  
uh yeah  
no but  
i <unk> now because sponge like material is dropped  
yes  
i dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact i would say  
clearly <unk> we we had done these  
no  
well how about a initial you get one battery when you buy it 'cause i'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk  
yeah  
or  
so <unk> should  
plastic  
oh okay  
uh-huh  
oops it's not plugged in quite in well enough  
components design  
you've just thrown data away  
and the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool  
just once you've gone through um and resolved all the open parentheses you can do the same for op uh double question marks  
no  
mm-hmm  
so the fact of having that information somewhere can help you to improve the recognition  
this is what i'm thinking  
well i think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top  
oh ye yes that's right  
and then we have to take this to the next level  
so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it to have very powerful and easy  
i have a veto  
first of all we are trying to do something that can be easily the the the idea is really it's something that you take you bring somewhere else and it works  
i think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places  
and then on the side you have the buttons  
uh <unk> wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide  
well well there's a special protocol to to deliver uh audio signals and uh its path through uh <unk> um  
because that was just a trend and we do have rubber buttons anyway  
but still yeah  
it's the same innovation  
uh-huh  
not too thick a layer of latex just enough to be <unk> like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that  
but if the  
uh-huh  
i dunno if i can open it  
and here we included breaking the power law because of the break  
yeah  
um notes sent out and uh etcetera  
uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that so we know that for sure  
and when you were talking about comparing energy in the case where a microphone would be distributed all around the table uh you're comparing energy and the time delay  
he's there or and when i can and i there was no op uh no <unk> every time i came to you you were available  
people will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it and  
well yeah the voice recognition of course is hard to learn i think  
that the so called yeah i don't think it should be should it  
yeah  
but still yeah it  
with something else that that tells you what a page that has no or very little text on it based on the links yeah  
okay  
yeah  
it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need  
but you should have some some task where you can individually look at the performance on every on every page  
i don't know  
that's where the user interface is really coming into its own  
okay  
tactile or something yeah  
yeah you have some more  
uh  
and who we're gonna be able to get it out of  
dynamic dynamic look  
no no  
so yeah so this is going to be based on the utterance to utterance  
just a little bit of  
so they want to <unk> use one button and then something happens  
so what so the stuff we have we have utterances and speakers and weights for utterances  
people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want  
yeah and the number of slots for visitors and for this new student who arrives  
yeah  
um do you have any opinions on any of them  
i think it's well if the r. r. motto is we bring fashion to to electronics i'd say that could be quite fashionable  
yes  
yeah i mean the uh yeah  
right um and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window  
so uh i take it your position <unk> is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick  
right  
puts less of constraint on what we can do but  
that's fair enough  
well  
mm  
so you might still wanna have everything in this one g. d. f. file format that represents everything  
the <unk>  
yes  
and spongy yeah  
okay  
we can have uh different uh uh fronts of the  
but um those dialogues acts um like thirty three in in the first meeting um they have a duration even though they don't have a word  
okay just saw  
and the <unk> are can be <unk> pretty difficult for this right  
uh well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls  
i mean uh you define that domain i mean which is uh large i mean which can be very general  
yes that's true  
well if you have the base you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery  
um and the other components are logic chips um again i'll i'll go back to the component chips  
we need to know what our final product is gonna be like so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does  
different frequency  
yeah well that's going to take too too much time  
i can <unk> i kinda take that to mean as um  
will be completely different  
or or this  
so back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and <unk> and the corporate colour and things like that  
yeah yeah  
mm  
alright  
an h. t. m. l. file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs and pretty much decided to just dump them all  
so if they make move a piece and it breaks and they don't hear this crash and they go oh what's you know what's happened  
yeah  
okay  
we have to ask  
and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to <unk> to surf when they see this stuff  
no okay  
okay  
for example uh at two different locations  
but i think it's important you know to have two scroll wheels because  
so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext  
i think it's a good idea  
so you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there i gotta do mine up at the board  
yeah  
maybe i record recorded directly on the  
yeah it shouldn't be in  
nice  
oh  
right  
mute  
and that's the danger is  
no the much more mathematical i think  
yeah it it's i think i think with its  
um as for what i would recommend for uh the the interface design and uh i will change the colours on the on the logo  
yeah  
yeah  
creativity  
<unk> effectively that's what the that's what they're saying that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext  
orange or something  
so the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker and which can use a regular chip <unk> which is six euros in total  
how did you get that in there  
you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever  
if you two could both do that as well in case we need to refer to it  
and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two which would be come from the button supplements category  
and also blast libraries and all these <unk> things  
new thing  
yes as you say with better uh yeah  
twelve point five  
yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said so  
uh the i'll mm not sure  
collect the data th aren't people filling out a form or something  
um  
fruity so fruity  
yeah  
maybe yeah yeah  
but if you want to be different then uh  
yep yeah the the one the one in just installed should have that now  
yeah  
yeah about three okay  
well i know know it's for rubber  
oh  
um if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever and you could look into um  
sometimes we use it but not it's not the first thing we use  
cool  
so we've decided on lighting up things  
uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah that was the right choice but to take something which which was uh direct in quotes  
alright  
they're both going to be not basic cases  
yeah  
of course  
okay  
mm-hmm  
i want to understand what did you mean by the <unk> uh the <unk> uh thing like saying that i took a dictionary and then a word from the slide and what you are looking for  
so overall i think we should stick with what we're finding everyone's looking for easy to use  
<unk> be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it  
mm  
i think  
uh you mean okay  
yeah um  
mm i kind of like the buttons  
because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable but at the same time  
i just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be yeah i think so  
but but how do you change from volume to channel  
um  
just say yeah pens  
um i dunno if you guys have any questions or <unk> whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature  
so what do we do  
included in your sub module kind of stuff um  
and then you can make um  
but they they have uh the pattern i think for <unk> even  
does that <unk> just in in sort of layers like that  
okay so  
you just need the command  
it was but it wa yeah it was a bit of a yeah it was creaky so yeah <unk> uh  
because um  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah well this was  
think it is  
i i want the no  
um  
so that's what we gotta go with  
another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money  
so  
and what is it happens inside the casing which is more your field  
although the the danger with that is it could look a bit cheap  
so you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and  
so  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
rabbit  
right  
let's say it like that  
'kay  
and what about oh  
well as far as i as far as i know i mean they do of course they can do of course slide detection  
yeah it's gonna be thicker  
so uh yes so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break through  
i <unk> presumably with g. d. f.  
because we need more talks and just you know do it like that  
yeah  
okay  
but we already kind of decided to go for the <unk> for the <unk> for the the arrow buttons  
that we can discuss afterwards  
pro project  
no no you you can start  
um  
one  
we have to do this  
why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful  
uh <unk> added five  
yeah  
okay that  
if people would like that  
so yeah  
mister just to  
so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want  
um  
this is for the design the design of the product is that um we wanna create um  
i mean i'm not like hard sold on the scroll wheel it's more just to give it a different kind of look  
okay  
uh uh about the c. s. c. w. class that will start at the end at the beginning of november  
uh it it yes it can do but it's also looking at it within their their own <unk> to see yeah  
yeah  
maybe behind a cushion or somewhere  
how long do we still have  
alright  
there you go  
that's why you're a marketing guru  
yeah this  
um and basically you record your own verbal labels <unk> and connect them to the remote control  
and you just press a number on your remote and then say confirm okay and then it's it's saved  
okay  
<unk> is this is <unk> we want to like see some signal  
okay  
yeah  
that's small  
it's got it  
i think it's <unk> it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors  
but this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the <unk> yeah for the buttons  
we understand that you we cannot wait uh we were here one year ago uh i don't know  
so the fact that this is going on beyond that green line here is something that's not ideal but that's something we have to sort out  
their stocks are a bit funny down there  
okay <unk> and you can measure measure that  
lyman alpha forest here  
poppy and tara will have to work together using <unk> clay  
yeah i dunno i  
mm-hmm  
it's good in case i ever have to defend it  
well with the voice recognition feature and uh  
mm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
when you look at it you can tell very clearly that one or two topics are a <unk> not the rest yeah  
yeah  
um  
it's the most important one  
the dialogue acts and there the player <unk> and here we'd have a search button and the similarity thing button  
yeah i i'm i'm  
okay and uh <unk> we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five euro um  
yeah  
it's a frame number  
but uh these we we have to choose the right icons or or letters  
um the means the <unk> the digital pen  
if they're using it and what they want to look at is facing away from them  
should it always compress a segment to a constant length though by a constant factor of time  
it that that's what i call trendy  
hmm  
<unk> so so i discussed with guillaume  
okay  
okay okay  
thank you  
do you have a powered microphone or something  
that that that's the <unk> product we're talking about one that will work for a in a home environment for a t. v. <unk> and  
but no he was billing for he was billing by the hour  
okay  
apart  
what if we flipped it around here so that it were um  
um yeah we're getting a lot of features now i i think  
messenger  
and uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um industrial designer should <unk> was supposed to work on th on th on the working design  
mm sure yeah we can do that  
mm-hmm  
yes  
if it's latex if it's <unk>  
well uh mm-hmm  
but uh  
okay and that's enough  
yeah  
yeah i think so  
under forty  
and they actually want a look and feel design user interface design you can look and see this as well as i can  
well the gender balancing we have more women than men in our department anyways so  
um  
no well apostrophe and then k. a. y.  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
first you've gotta choose your approach and not worry about the band width  
so  
<unk> 'cause it was through the rotational part  
a strip of uh lights or something  
two  
that's not a source type  
then only they'll ask you that this is the quotation  
yeah  
mm  
maybe two  
no  
true  
it's uh we were talking that we did some experiments to see if the word during meeting the words appear independently of the slides in a sense that uh if certain words tend to appear during certain slides or no  
yeah like in a laptop <unk> uh <unk> some sort of thing  
four point  
yeah  
okay  
cool so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though doesn't it  
and on the other side we have maria martin and myself who all work on the same project  
um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average um while the user's watching t. v.  
yeah  
you could look at at which pages are completely missed by one model  
um  
ten years  
fashion in electronics  
and uh i hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product  
but you got a base  
welcome to the conceptual design meeting  
thanks for coming  
but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material it's a bit more bouncy like you said they get chucked around a lot  
no no no not at all  
ye ye  
because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit  
all <unk> no that's um kinda dependent on the television  
yeah  
if it's not too expensive <unk> i think it's a good gimmick  
yeah put it back  
so then i can can share what i ca have read and uh  
that's for her benefit  
yeah  
now it's fancy let's add one instead of two  
for universal remotes  
so why <unk> mm i think better  
i think we should scrap the sample speaker  
neither  
i'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that  
so though it's a bit hairy at the moment isn't it  
yeah but just do some we we  
yeah  
yeah and then  
brightness and contrast  
exactly  
yeah  
take it from somewhere so yeah you have some rub yeah  
yeah  
'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an l. c. d. display on it that's got different pages for different devices  
so that might  
mm  
red white blue black  
a plastic cover with rubber finishing  
it's a selection wheel  
that one might have to be based on  
uh um might not be relevant  
and i think this is one  
our agenda is as before for me to open the meeting for us to go over the previous minutes  
good  
so it will be uh the advanced chip or the uh <unk> uh or the regular chip  
so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something  
but then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right  
yeah  
well  
i don't know just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them  
go down  
<unk>  
and it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes  
we're using kinetic battery right  
'cause you'd probably be quite likely if they're talking about a conference or a person  
<unk> <unk> gives you the times of the audio beep in the <unk> in the signal  
it's just <unk> it will be bought by people under forty  
thank you  
um okay so c.  
and in that case it will be up to you to use the at symbol  
there's too much gear  
<unk>  
yeah  
i mean it  
yeah  
yeah  
so that's a one then huh  
and a single function remote control used specifically for the television  
yeah  
but is it uh  
that's three buttons and this would cost  
all you need to do is train them to the individual one all you need to do is is know the the <unk> like some four digit code  
um so the flashing of the beep we have well anything  
no no no  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you can't even draw anymore  
so that like file proof or something yeah  
i think so yeah  
um has to look really cool flashy groovy for people to buy it  
um i <unk> might talk to ellen about that ahead of time 'cause uh they may have she and martin may have had discussions about appropriate use of the lab  
maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh <unk> uh page up page down  
yeah  
is that so  
i think i yeah i it's again in this uh what i said first it has to be fancy so i think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it i think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't  
nope  
okay  
but i get <unk> like every <unk> every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something  
oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well  
and we are having the speakers regular chip for control  
yeah the key the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation  
okay  
so  
yeah but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap  
does it feel good  
but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now  
i don't know  
start to eat banana  
i thought you can curve somebody  
yeah  
um uh it's just an idea i had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table  
oh well not in this presentation  
yeah  
right  
but um i think <unk> it you know <unk> well so one thing that's gonna be interesting is the i think to me  
the excesses yeah  
okay  
mm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so and yeah and every and everything above that threshold i could then add the utterance where it occurs  
um i mean the research did come up with fruit and <unk> so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy  
yeah  
um oh yeah can you see my little mouse pointer  
i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control does say quite a lot really  
uh  
you make it <unk> orange or whatever you want  
yeah  
so a definition of we're all looking at and touching the same thing  
so it's quite advanced  
i haven't i haven't figured out how to tunnel through the gateway into another machine yet  
yeah  
well i'm not not not <unk> not planning do much on that  
if it was radio loud quasar then you would mark it as one thing  
you said about disposable <unk> people want disposable things so we could do that like have a choice  
yeah  
is it nokia's being sued in the u. s. for their <unk> band usage 'cause you know intellectual property  
yeah yeah yeah  
other options are solar cells hand dynamo and basic battery  
and it's it's it's well i don't think we're actually  
and then uh settings  
okay  
so the yeah  
gonna do what you were gonna do  
yeah like that  
um because i'm taking minutes and it  
mm-hmm  
um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes  
okay so i was looking at trend watching  
and  
mm-hmm  
i'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an l. c. d. screen  
uh of course the u. i. d. mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our <unk> market expert sammy <unk> uh on the trend watching  
yeah it's kind of um simple pro <unk> programmable device and we have to insert  
uh  
dead  
yeah  
uh i've lined them up here  
right  
yeah but  
could you give people a set of pages and like say you did it with five topics for example  
so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be  
mm  
go on  
yeah you wanna  
and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles  
oh we already on nine  
yeah  
no yeah th th the user requirements of the the the new project requirements told us not to but maybe <unk> yeah  
yeah there we go  
yeah  
i i no no no no no  
that's no bother i mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it  
so uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work i think then it's pretty useful  
i think you need to look into the material  
yeah it it's just a remote control so  
um i think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um  
okay  
mm-hmm  
never heard of it  
yeah we have to take that out  
mm not real  
yeah  
yeah  
so can we expect a christmas uh gift  
and also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls  
yeah just oh <unk> you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah  
yeah so uh i think yeah these are the three main points  
yeah  
mm that's just a  
yeah  
yeah  
but if you have something like uh the siemens phone it's rubber  
mm  
so if we if we if for if for each one segment time slot we could attach a value  
what about m. l. m. i.  
i personally think because i <unk> i don't think i maybe it's easy to use it has to be easy to find right away  
they've got a bit of free cash so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket  
but what this actually means is we've made some measurements based on damped lyman alpha measurements and they tell us this answer  
you want it big do you want it small  
if you grab the remote your hands should be on top of the plus  
mm  
so either  
the the video channel uh  
do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it  
'cause when we've been working together like i've just not got a lot done  
uh yeah  
when did you receive this list  
but  
mm  
is it is it something that's a very valued thing that has to be protected um  
yeah but it i think it should work for just one document because it it compares between the categories  
but  
so your you think we should go for a more <unk> universal high performance  
okay  
yeah yeah  
okay um well we aimed for the younger market  
what yeah you don't know why why you are doing it anymore  
but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them  
even if it pauses for ten seconds well that's tough luck then  
and in my case it would have i think it would have different uh values for each category  
satisfaction with for example the room for creativity leadership teamwork the means any new ideas found  
um right um so any thoughts  
yeah but yeah but that isn't possible  
just where can i  
uh integrated circuits  
so i think that's more something you can focus  
so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top  
right  
yeah  
because we do not implement uh a user history  
well you can use um when you uh how do you call it <unk> um synchronized the um remote and the t. v. then there's always  
so yeah it it's pretty much good time also no  
it depends also on your on your  
yeah  
they might wanna be the first ones to uh  
are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve <unk> our twelve fifty euro you know goal for selling these things  
yeah  
well we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah  
i mean this should should be have all details  
oh sorry one <unk> yeah  
so keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of it has to <unk> to be built  
i will uh write uh minutes if i can create them out of this  
good we're done  
uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations  
stop the curve here or continue it  
mm-hmm  
we want a high responsive product  
how do you mean  
<unk>  
mm there's a risk of that  
yeah  
but only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the <unk> added feature of parental control  
um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside  
well  
um i just did a preliminary study here and uh i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands  
oh see i i think that the the price is this one  
you know <unk> they get ours and <unk> it's doesn't have that  
mister ed  
it's blinking at me  
okay  
yeah there's that box in uh <unk> of it  
yeah you got exactly the same access to sound quality as you got from <unk> anything else on the windows  
right  
sample speaker  
and those are fixed we can't do anything about those  
okay  
mm  
so  
to have eight more x. l. r. if we need it  
yeah  
it's a whale yes  
you can compress it from a remote session and s. c. p. it from the same session  
i didn't see  
i guess that is something for <unk> and sebastian  
yeah sure  
no  
don't listen  
yeah  
um  
absorption line systems  
so let's  
uh  
okay then the push button i was just counting them  
management expert you have to change that  
and this can allow to choose the the program for instance without uh adding uh buttons  
sure  
a normal use guarantee which means that this product for the for the life of of the life use  
well sounds good  
mm-hmm okay  
mm  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
to function it it doesn't really have to be <unk> uh big of course  
um so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative  
i just look at the mm  
and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us  
yep  
so i'm  
something like that  
so and that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one  
so even if you sort of even if you do an hourglass at that moment and you know  
yeah  
okay it's your cat  
yeah  
well i've done some research again about trends on the internet  
alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting  
hmm  
not do it at all  
so then you can infer some heuristics like okay the alpha should be proportional to the lengths or anything like that  
cool  
yeah but but the the plus or the minus  
on a video annotation on a video structure co correction  
sensors  
yep  
mm-hmm  
the most ordinary uh batteries  
what's it's called something else isn't it  
yeah i go four  
uh so we will see our three presentations  
excellent  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it looks like it's going over well so  
uh that's all i think  
yeah  
uh too difficult um maybe uh it's easier to break it  
oh  
yeah  
that you want to protect a bit  
um yes those are the changes  
so we will um  
fourth point  
uh i think you should work together <unk> you uh hamed and peter to work uh in a in a first prototype and uh  
anything else  
yeah  
so that would more be the the topic segments then  
no add  
what is it <unk> is that the speaker we were <unk> i don't know what it is  
uh so um so we're going for a stylish  
uh i think uh  
mm  
well th and the young and trendy they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for <unk> uh clothes  
did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done  
so you have to the <unk> the user there for example the power off button it is something very international you know that  
mm  
yeah the yeah  
then the material must be able to put the light inside you know  
mm-hmm  
yeah and uh  
very non committal four  
my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote yeah that's just an estimate though  
if it's  
ho ho  
so this one  
um and it would need <unk> there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users  
it is very bright yeah  
um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier  
yeah  
well  
um next  
functionally you're gonna have to intercept so four is a good estimate for  
i think also  
fronts are are cheaper than when they're from <unk>  
and most sometimes you can't able to go to oral talk this oral presentations most of the time  
your moment to shine  
if not um the national library is bound to have it  
they're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns  
uh  
are we all in agreement about the well the primary structure of the of my design  
yeah exactly  
yeah the biology  
we  
you think  
okay okay that's clear  
yes  
volume or channel  
um i think we're almost done yeah  
mm yeah  
i had one  
mm mm  
well the sides i haven't seen yet uh  
and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use  
uh  
kind of a <unk>  
if we're not going the touch screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things  
yeah mm  
intuitive  
you <unk>  
yeah pretty soon i think i guess that's now  
but that's gonna be susceptible to having phase problems is that when you  
yeah because we do not have a a a a a home um  
perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the excel sheet  
galaxies  
mm with my project manager salary i would think yeah i could probably afford this uh would i buy it  
uh okay still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and  
um you know li <unk> if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit  
hi <unk> set is uh not often used uh as i know of in combination with television  
elegant  
so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on  
and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r. r.  
okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
do you wanna stay somewhere near the board so that if we need to you can sit down but just we might need you to leap up  
we kept uh one paper sheet  
i know you <unk> you should test it under uh under a light conditions  
yeah  
so  
and um you can also delete an entire page but we ask you not to do that  
yeah  
a remote control without the ten digits  
no  
yeah  
six  
then it goes like this  
no <unk> next year that's out  
project evaluation good  
yeah we're we're not quite uh objective about this  
well we've covered that with the trendy  
right  
um the user interface designer will work on the user interface design and the marketing expert is going to work on product evaluation  
to go <unk> to go faster  
yep  
and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um so  
yep  
okay  
a synchronized pipe  
function  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
do we have everything for the same meeting at the moment  
right  
that where one said it was probably an english phrase and the other said it was probably a french phrase  
like for example uh i would like to store in certain way  
six let's go for six  
<unk> uh the i mean i'm just thinking from practical perspectives  
uh not yet but if you want  
put it  
oh  
okay well that's my contribution to this meeting and uh  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah  
so in this hierarchical <unk> architecture i will be able to uh integrate the extra knowledge at the proper level of hierarchy  
so  
uh  
next one  
huh  
how would that be  
oh i see what you mean  
uh and it's up to you to tell us roughly when do you think uh we're gonna have something working  
so um you have to work on the on the working design  
can you do that  
yeah could be that i was a bit sleepy  
you are the specialists of that  
okay then we have fifteen point eight euros  
well i guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research  
so yeah  
is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up  
it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons maybe <unk> the buttons with some internal l. e. d. <unk> to shine through the casing  
but yeah it should uh should be updated without any  
yeah  
um  
yes sure  
but you just uh get it in in this way in in the way of rob's right  
well probably to simulate the whole working uh process huh th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks  
it can sit at a distance and pick it up still  
why  
so yeah  
or you <unk> it's or change the titanium or dump the l. c. d. screen  
yeah comfortable headsets would be nice  
mm yeah  
that's grand  
yeah i don't see why not  
and then we can start fighting about  
um we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager  
i guess that's what we were  
so that should be really easy to cut out  
yeah i was uh yeah  
uh there is two or three time uh you see you see the same uh same kind of uh scene uh just uh two or three seconds  
well you need a camera  
okay well great  
i dunno  
yeah  
oh  
yeah a tape three uh okay let's call that  
so we cut it to see  
i keep forgetting whether i've done this  
and uh then people you know people demand more real reaction stuff  
so do we need to re train mike on how to put his mic on  
um and so who are we aiming this at  
yeah or three  
there is not problems with the  
but i don't remember sort of arguing from different sides and converging just sort of piecing out what would come up and agreeing what we'd do  
but here it's relative phase between the microphones  
let's not mark it then  
see some of it  
with the wheel on the top and to control and here you have a a push button to  
okay well <unk> you do an average at the end i don't know  
no no no because we we discussed that you could charge it otherwise is it it jumps to stand by mode automatically  
whereas  
maybe give it give it a form  
yeah  
yeah i should maybe just get started with 'em  
which is trend watch  
that's what we have there  
the buttons could be fruit shaped  
yeah i believe so  
well uh  
<unk> yeah  
yeah so  
not the moment  
yes  
is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website and then there was just extra information  
yeah but one other question  
okay  
and then for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so the presentation is now <unk> two weeks from today  
uh-huh  
yeah but we didn't do any speech recon re reconstruction  
i think  
like any text  
um this is my picture  
okay it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes <unk> together versus having <unk> five different remotes  
'cause the plug in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that  
could  
okay yeah  
right  
yeah before the task  
yeah  
um  
are you talking about this or that  
for example ten sectors around the table  
ah okay  
okay and uh was it  
okay  
mm 'kay  
too green  
you're trendy  
and within this checking the speech segments you want to listen for or look for missed um  
hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy  
yeah  
it is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting  
i don't see why you can't stay here really  
right  
do you think  
if you go to your <unk> or something you should  
but i probably it's probable that even for the project you would do some of the reprogramming  
no <unk> you would rec  
and we can change the intensity  
mm  
maybe i take your chair  
precise  
yeah i mean it's  
no  
amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there  
so i i i think it is  
we're about to start so have a seat  
can you repeat it  
so is that ease of use or uh is that more like um  
mm-hmm  
i think  
you have to keep it  
no okay but just just a wooden uh look  
yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system  
uh  
well this is just what how i would go about it  
okay  
have a look at uh um <unk> hopefully there's not a <unk> a problem  
right  
yeah so but you have to  
um  
yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right  
yeah  
i tried to uh the l. c. d. screen i tried to sort of to draw  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh right  
yeah which is which is probably i mean  
so we have three colour displays  
do you think  
yes  
you know like to sit out and say uh one converge to one approach and then just do without that yeah  
interface concepts new  
remote settings et cetera  
yeah alright  
ah so now i'm having a complete mess of like split  
'cause that'd be playing it backwards twice as quickly  
okay  
is a <unk> big group and like you showed <unk> not very much people buy our stuff  
yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control i suppose  
and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject and the power button  
okay  
okay  
um yep so there  
yeah but is going to be always turned on the light  
yeah  
people who are <unk> growing up used to you know in schools and in universities  
yeah  
but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some of you or you double click it  
you forgot the chips  
hmm  
shouldn't be  
yeah  
yes i don't know how many times i've missed the  
we should now go away and get these things sorted out  
<unk> i don't know if that might cope with like the trend watching  
yeah but mm  
yeah i mean that that seems to work well with for products like ipod where you know you have a variety of colours  
uh one one two threes two  
yeah  
sorry  
yeah but it's only one half  
yeah right  
though it was our specification  
well  
like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay  
yeah  
okay  
okay okay so the components  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but there is a is it really necessary 'cause a normal push button can do that job  
mm  
dunno if any of you have seen napoleon dynamite before  
it would get bumped it's doesn't really fit with your hand  
yeah i think we should ha take the time because i think it will be  
but there's balance between function and the cost  
um  
by nine  
uh i think  
but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want  
so let's cut the t. f. t.  
yeah  
no and use an image if possible  
yeah but then the remote control i think i mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television  
and you can decide how many bands you want more or less  
um i don't know if it's a gimmick or not  
okay  
okay  
but uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the  
but what's our slogan  
well i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it doesn't it  
um we decided that or we know that we need to use company colours company logo  
right and we were going for more simplistic style right  
the main thing  
and i was thinking that's probably what you meant just um having like for each sort of of our segments having just the i. d.  
'kay well we know we want numbers  
yeah  
huh  
and we could probably get away with black too but  
really it looks like the lines  
mm mm  
can you just remind me i don't have to tick the no <unk> okay thing until i finish writing  
so good morning everyone  
it's like v. i. editor you are having two modes similarly  
yeah  
um but uh once you have done this as i said  
mm-hmm  
de  
mm  
okay  
um i'm very excited by this one actually guys i uh had a lot of fun doing it  
but  
uh  
but  
good luck  
as for the um  
and i've uh sent a thing off to <unk> talk trying to encourage her again to register for the c. s. v. and uh and what to the c. v. s. and uh <unk> what to do and uh which bit of software i use that seems to be quite easy and simple  
yeah  
yeah  
that's maybe not the most important but it's just  
uh this is going to be  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
i went to high school with tom willing actually  
<unk> should we target a a user <unk> uh uh remote control  
and uh elderly people our market are less interested in uh nice features but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
so i guess we're looking at something rather simple  
escape okay  
or  
very good  
uh so the concept of the interface  
okay it's r. m. nine dot r. m. for other stuff  
and then you have your apple shaped remote control which is not trendy anymore  
yeah  
right  
so what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components um  
how do you make it do both  
i've seen it  
yeah  
one battery  
mm  
you second that you second that we lose the curve  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
'cause i don't think there is any way to say generally this this is better or worse  
so next  
okay and then buttons we have what two colours  
no i don't have any idea about what each component costs  
yeah  
a button is better  
okay well if that's possible yeah  
and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well you know  
so we <unk> we wanna do some piloting at the end of the week  
but maybe because uh you are working on the user requirements you are working on the technical functions  
i start like this then  
yeah  
do you get an idea of the shape  
so  
yeah  
i don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one because <unk>  
a little bit  
instead of having context from one to capital d. which is for the whole utterance which doesn't make much sense in general  
mm-hmm  
and uh  
yeah i think that's a nice trade off  
so if something is a minute and three seconds i can still have it right  
yes i do think who's gonna have the money to buy that also that one  
definitely  
so you could just um you could use just the same thing we used to build the big dictionary  
can you see it  
you <unk> may use like when there's uh x. p. uh a simple log on <unk> you just push uh one or two or three  
<unk>  
so let's carry on with this  
and you can go on both sides as well  
you know um <unk> so it's easier to hold onto that way  
yeah but uh we can think that in a few years there will be t. v. set that can access the internet  
it it depends on you not because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that  
uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so <unk> we can all see it  
um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh  
okay  
two objects close together your eye gaze can actually be looking at the left edge of one and the right edge of the other  
well they uh  
uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah you can tell what room the mobile is  
yeah  
it's a led actually which which <unk> be covering in a curve  
hmm of course  
yeah  
no  
no  
i guess we've <unk> we've touched on most of this  
yeah this is the the initial specifications  
and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or you know  
how much easier would it be if we truly understood this  
yes as i already said we could drop some of these buttons  
mm-hmm  
you putting in different colours  
does this  
indeed  
for example i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb  
narrow line <unk> one should all be one  
why  
i'm robin  
what's to be said about it  
um these these aren't technology options in that sense  
so um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want  
so now on we can increase our still you have two more  
that's easy  
yeah so  
it's coming up  
it's a mouse  
so anything that has less than say <unk> point five importance gets assigned to zero  
okay  
but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer  
or maybe six because it's just one one i one among the issues i mean  
yeah  
those uh there were many of them  
yeah but people like something uh new you know  
uh-huh  
so what is proposed to solve this problem is to use a uh what we formally use in h. m. m. formalism which is called gamma uh state posterior  
takes too long to master the remote control  
okay so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it  
no nothing really trendy about it  
oh pussy  
'kay  
mm  
mm-hmm  
no  
um but yeah the the age is uh under forty  
if you do that but i don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half euros  
three yeah  
one cur you could also make the curve go through of course  
okay  
so those are the criteria  
seems to be quite complex  
okay  
you know some remote control have uh protection and so you you <unk>  
yeah  
i mean what is important is not the word that appear once it's the word that appear  
i'm not gonna do this  
but even now if only our production costs <unk> uh were exceeded the double  
are we going one on  
i i um with i. m. two i i i did uh i mention that i will have from january two thousand six i will have time for that  
yeah right  
couple of words  
yeah  
and you can programme the keys if you want to certain keys are even the channel information  
yeah  
thing that's inside it  
sorry  
right okay  
so  
yeah  
okay what else does our remote need  
oh  
um and uh  
yeah  
yeah a yeah  
but now in original design i say two  
um and the lower components the power the logic the transmitter and the infrared um they affect you in terms of the size of your device  
so if you put them in there we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to  
everything they define  
as you also notice it's quite a boring design  
<unk>  
and this is a push button one so you see these little little buttons here  
so we have to uh put it in one uh document  
is this uh the last assignment  
when my mouse works again  
mm-hmm  
okay  
but  
so and  
this sounds like a really great idea  
i used one word  
okay  
um  
but  
no  
it's it's incorporated with <unk> <unk> plus and down uh those  
and that's not so much what he meant with not possibly loading everything was that you <unk> um load all the uh annotation stuff  
i will beat the dolphin  
traverse maybe quite a few menus if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example they usually incorporate they have the keypad  
to <unk> uh to take this take these points into the notes  
yeah but i'm also just like i think that probably the entropy value at the moment for a word is closer to what we're at the moment looking for  
i think  
i mean  
see  
yeah i think you're going to <unk> you're going to use it with one thumb  
of <unk> of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product  
helium one  
no bigger  
<unk> just make two designs  
yeah  
but what i <unk> my sense is that it is not so much important still  
well function f. eight  
yeah draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big  
yeah  
and the colour is yellow right  
either just to uh in parentheses uh we didn't choose that um that solution because they had no um the the slides were not captured very uh in a very uh precise way  
yes  
so that's what that was quite easy to do  
okay right well i take it that you are all ready now  
we he well here's my thing about that  
if you want to go back you have to back button go back  
but uh yeah well uh  
let's just get that bigger  
um the yellow rubber i think so  
doesn't  
yeah  
and shall i go first  
a five  
uh  
'kay  
true  
okay  
that that that that's gonna the the chip set will hold it firm in place and uh and and uh and a l. c. d. screen also  
okay  
and what about the buttons  
but it's yeah we put the um  
okay auxiliary inputs  
mm i think <unk>  
that's one of the <unk> uh  
oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case  
i've picked this animal because it's very fast  
black usually  
um i will tell something about the way this uh this test was yeah done  
yeah <unk> maybe um <unk> we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function  
as i was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation  
yeah in fact it's not there is no <unk> i it was called vision lib to read uh to to extract one frame each frame of a video  
who who gave you the master class  
yeah  
um  
um and finally um uh sort i've sort of covered that our product i think should be user interface orientated  
mm-hmm  
start looking at the um at the design in more detail  
if you're around one i had a roommate who was um allergic  
thanks  
component  
project finance  
right  
right okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand  
let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later  
uh  
a pi there's that box in the t. v. so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t. v.  
yeah for  
because once you <unk> the data then you don't need to have full i know  
well but well <unk> every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the t. v. so  
um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we but possibly a sticker  
so the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one  
so if you're really transmitting just one <unk> line  
and uh finally it should be clear that the corporate image  
the less uh expressive it can be  
but all all of it is doable in three four days time  
seems not seems not  
yeah  
oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a <unk> probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of <unk> that <unk> shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it  
next meeting starts in thirty minutes  
yeah  
it'd be annoying  
yes  
you ca you can turn this  
do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour  
and to improve the the look  
we're kinda losing time though  
just  
you know any uh chopping the starts of audio signals to get there was nothing okay  
but have to look at all the future and so just a <unk>  
uh actually martin is fifty per cent time  
no the buttons those are really needed  
as is an a. g. n.  
so  
yeah  
uh-huh  
to the current market  
cool  
more like something  
um but in this case it'll only be t. v. <unk>  
yes you are right yeah  
could i mean you could hold it in your left hand and <unk> use your index finger  
just  
so yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l. c. d. screen except for the really really kind of main functions  
not telling that you are young  
this generates yeah  
well  
yeah  
i think we should th then take it take yellow  
and we've been talking about it the whole time  
which then goes through the infra red so the the chip that uh i think ian is designing is gonna be crucial  
ooh that's tight  
but um okay what you see here um in this part is uh  
mm okay  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah i may as well come and you can show me how it the manager works  
hmm  
okay  
yeah  
or you ca you can you can also turn this  
yeah  
okay thanks  
that's it  
a single function remote control is simpler to use but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices  
<unk> usually it's going to be more of an isolated  
okay  
um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for so  
have to do you have to do it in the box  
no the first one  
yeah i think so  
mm yeah it'll get there  
like with a with a mouse you have not yeah  
that's the bit you can press it in or something harder  
it's easy to 'cause you're so used to <unk> <unk> tuning them out  
right  
yes  
okay  
um let's make a decision  
black and yellow yeah  
okay  
what about the energy source  
i need not have an  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
kind of  
other inputs from the <unk> public demands  
and we have um maybe we have to we say only for t. v. not teletext  
oh it isn't well okay  
alright  
so why don't we use it  
i don't know i'm i'm sure that they will be well i hope they will be a of something like this yeah  
that was the last one like i chose not to do a <unk> 'cause i didn't think it made sense to  
right  
no no no no  
is it easy to use  
we make updates and sell it  
uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well  
so next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh  
'cause that would go up to like fifty  
well the there is a there's a delay on remotes i think  
and  
mm-hmm  
'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a  
yep  
what <unk> <unk> <unk> um  
mm-hmm  
hard to lose  
yeah  
two batteries or one  
<unk>  
anyway so um  
uh  
<unk> go on ahead  
that's right yeah corporate colour  
yep  
okay  
make a new one  
only if they're <unk>  
i'm afraid i would  
it's yeah  
should actually be excess blue wing flux  
yeah  
to be different  
i think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and  
so yeah  
mm-hmm  
not easy  
and uh you can make new sheets by uh by <unk> <unk> pressing on the blank button  
and then just sort of everyone make sure everyone understand the interface  
okay  
how do you mean  
yeah  
yep  
but an anyway it's difficult i mean in th in in in general  
mm  
mm-hmm  
yep  
seven  
no they have two fronts that  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
straight forward  
you had something like this right  
yeah but it looks good  
um  
okay  
not  
i think we were just getting <unk> with the task  
oh but it's just one  
is that really all what happened  
sorry  
okay  
yeah he still had <unk> hours left  
<unk> <unk> what would be your guess  
if if it's something like rubber made or i think it it's also going to be good  
our final prototype which yeah  
so do we need special colour  
okay  
uh just let me check  
they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote  
perfect  
i don't know 'cause you in language speak mark each as a separate entity  
easy to use it's very relative but three it's fine i think it's reasonable three  
alright  
that's the most important thing  
so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size  
oh right  
yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board and you can remove the front  
uh-huh  
so i'll create a dictionary  
so the <unk> uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button  
you can break it  
these are the things that look like we feel they're important  
um hit function f. eight real quickly hold down  
buy a fifty cents battery and uh  
yeah 'cause we haven't got the double curve so we can't like say it's completely true  
let's have a look  
yeah  
oh yeah they're all they're not connected to anything on the table you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em  
um if  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
yep  
um yeah  
i didn't have any uh more information it's just always the same here  
yeah  
i'm just thinking <unk> if  
it's not so random huh  
very interesting  
yes it  
okay  
if we need more then we might use some more finer uh <unk> finer uh definition for interactivity  
off yeah  
colour  
yeah  
you're late  
uh not everyone um who is looking t. v. can go to internet when they want to see the latest news  
doesn't take a hundred  
just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness i uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control  
yeah  
as a separate room  
well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic the wood and the titanium  
mm-hmm  
or the combination  
um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros  
mm-hmm  
maybe only the on and <unk> on and off button  
yeah that is true  
huh  
mm-hmm  
you see you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen  
more or less i think  
really  
whether we can replicate the results whatever results you are showing whether we can replicate them or not  
you must <unk> <unk> uh push a little uh good  
i guess i'll go next then  
you mean that each person will have a specific frequency because i the way he's talking or his <unk>  
so  
yeah  
it's co <unk> quite <unk>  
okay  
it actually notifies the you know the system administrator or makes certain kind of um noise  
let's vote on it  
uh we will try to uh  
well that's kind of  
uh so i was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense  
and speech <unk> recognition  
uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards  
one more thing is that i  
so is that a close  
okay  
think it was also <unk> of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning  
the standards  
yeah he's <unk> no he has many more <unk> many more people so to take care of  
it's quite goods  
yeah  
that that's what he was re what he was really interested in was the kind of coding which would define the building sequence okay  
yeah  
three three solar cells  
yeah  
uh first you have the energy source  
yeah  
yeah  
a human yay  
mm-hmm  
and i i like geckos because they remind me of warm places and  
but you also forget to buy batteries and then you can you can't use it so i  
it's more clear now i think  
well  
yeah i would <unk> that would be my my feeling  
yeah  
so um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh  
'cause i was putting groceries away  
that's useful  
uh this looks a little  
very good  
so i would give this a five  
well i've written down an an on or off button volume selection channel selection uh the digits from one to zero huh  
mm-hmm i'm just emailing it to you  
so i would give this a two  
better ideas  
mm-hmm  
yeah i <unk> said two would seem reasonable  
mm-hmm  
ah good  
no no no  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so it's the best view  
yeah and it's  
ah  
which is there  
okay  
um in the concept design the user interface how the user reacts with the the product  
succeed in it also  
for a girl it's always the pain  
okay  
'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture  
do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here  
yeah i think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing 'cause it's it it breaks down easier  
yeah but i mean if you have an add ons the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it  
that's another article  
exactly  
so that's an extra  
and and why do you want these kind of component  
and we are not able to integrate the prior knowledge we can have about phone use or about  
'kay  
uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different um you know short range  
but i kind of uh  
yeah uh uh  
okay  
'cause now is the time for us to be figuring out what we want out of that data and and getting you write the stuff or getting j. p. to write the one dimensional analyses that he was talking about  
um there are probably about thirty on there  
how about do both  
yeah  
yeah  
functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen  
do we need that  
creativity  
so it became highly irritating  
or something that has a a turning dial where at the far end is on or off  
here we go again  
um let me see uh  
turn the page  
so programme start zero one enter zero five enter thirty eight enter programme end  
yeah that's how it is  
i mean better if we could just check all the cost with l. c. d. and also with the speech recognition  
you  
the chip um silicon based chip i don't really see any way around that we can't really be different in that respect  
yeah okay  
yeah yeah okay  
yeah  
yeah  
it's quite good for the proposal directly  
oh it's nice  
yeah  
same for this one here for these two here  
i save it uh  
what  
so  
fruit is uh yellow green red whatever  
uh no  
yeah  
um there was nothing nothing over last week  
and and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid because if you flip it open you can still do the <unk> here  
soon  
well like the ideas we're calculating are information density all off line first for every utterance in the whole corpus right  
uh-huh  
so hold it uh like this  
okay  
i'm the user interface uh expert  
sender  
okay so we stick with what we've got there  
i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty  
tables  
somebody booked the meeting room just for at one p. m. and so we should leave  
no it's one curve  
we have we have just  
and when  
oh yeah  
like the way how we uh store individual utterances and stuff  
now uh i ask you to <unk> the prototype  
it's three features basically the l. c. d. touch screen is feature  
nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news  
is the l. c. d. screen  
um just about the three buckets um what would go in the the device functions one  
yeah  
or we could use a double sided for less used functions you  
we'll take a look at the project plan  
yeah it was more important so i just  
right well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes  
and we don't have the exact audio record for this  
yeah okay  
mm mm  
what is her other side  
six  
yeah  
so i have to just there's examples <unk> um for for doing stuff like that  
and it i guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh  
quite expensive  
who wants to go next  
uh no  
and mostly they are smaller  
yep yeah  
ah okay then it's okay  
uh yeah  
mm mm mm mm  
hmm  
if that comes up again we've got um headset mic files now  
ooh  
hmm  
um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work  
okay now it must be there  
do you  
it's good  
yeah  
so  
in which case we are done  
team member with his presentation  
we're not supposed to do components  
yep  
um i think where it isn't seen  
yeah  
okay  
uh  
using the cable subscribed the cable providers but our remote controls would get worn out really easily  
so if you finish that then you'll see uh  
what else do we need to know  
so uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme  
uh now you give people five sheets uh you give uh a <unk> a a user five sheets of paper each with  
um  
uh well what do you what did you think about the <unk>  
mm  
uh yeah another thing is the logo is missing still  
okay  
or using the centre part of the table to show some something more about the um uh more general uh dynamic  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i just give you these things now because these are my thoughts and feelings  
yeah  
it's just one question  
for the remote control  
um apart from maybe  
so that's one  
maybe yes  
yeah  
right  
it has a has a microphone has a speaker it's got a little chip and it allows you <unk>  
mm-hmm  
okay  
as i said several time we are not we did not commit to provide anything  
because it is one point eight uh two so we will do two  
cheers  
they uh watch in uh cities like uh paris and milan  
um <unk> i think direct show you can download for free  
we have it and we design later where everything goes  
splendid  
yeah maybe the base  
okay  
okay  
or  
wood is popular  
yeah  
okay  
uh whereas a single curved would be  
uh-huh  
we won't go with that one did you say  
actually they have a lot in common  
we are <unk> targeting the television set  
um  
could we guarantee that it'd work  
yeah and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square  
do we have any information on this  
some speaker sorry yeah  
maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep  
michael you can go ahead  
yeah  
mm  
should be okay  
mm  
have you  
okay  
so  
smoking  
but there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext  
um it would also have to have uh a kind of <unk> in it  
when i <unk> when i see the when i see the product i i i i don't wanna buy it  
no no they are the same otherwise  
mm  
feature  
mm-hmm  
okay mm yes i have it  
yep  
again we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons  
should i write  
um you know compromise the our our need for uh you know it it being  
we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything  
audio  
okay  
ergonomic  
so this stuff is <unk> based on on these intensity measures  
<unk> i mean uh  
although at that point we can use this  
you know as opposed to two  
um just building the whole thing in one then having getting cheaper production costs um and  
you're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see but well i i when i think oh yeah for the <unk> for all the standard channels  
i  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so well essentially now we have the material as far i'm as i'm understood  
changing covers  
one original colour and then sort of two supplements i think maybe  
um right so for now just for th the white board um  
i i'm not sure i miss them plenty myself  
so  
yeah i know  
yeah  
you do not want another device which can be uh everywhere in the house which you have to find first before you can find your remote control  
yeah  
okay  
but i think that's maybe as far as that one could go  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
it's what i'll have to do this week  
so  
yeah 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip titanium will be more expensive  
i it's enough yeah  
um so sorry and the the a. g. n. i think that should be one entity right  
plastic  
but basically the beginning is your signal which you slice into frame  
with the <unk> okay  
yeah  
um but where where is the  
i don't know now  
left or right  
so it's just a matter of pulling that out and put that into the um into the g. d. f. stuff  
just another two  
the the  
mike uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the word documents file  
yeah and also we don't have to recalculate if just one  
you wanna enter just the number of it if you know it  
pricing is a factor for us that's why we'll go for the regular chip  
mm-hmm  
he'll do it in his free time  
smart no  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
alright  
yeah  
every language of dialects  
i mean i don't know  
mm  
yeah  
it works  
yeah  
ah  
okay  
i think we it should be <unk> it would be better if we worked a little bit together  
i rather keep i rather keep the display  
uh <unk> has has no objection against sharing the office  
i do like uh the little martian one  
i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote  
'cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh  
i think you have to uh change your desktop uh  
isn't  
oh no that's cool it's got i'm kind of i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber i think that would have been nice  
yes  
well that it doesn't  
um  
yeah  
um so i like monkeys  
they're happy  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
yeah  
because it uh th it's it's generating a new i. d. when you <unk> when you create a new part  
th  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay  
ah uh  
but i think the right way to do this is to be able to inspect the data in um some tool and play around with the definitions  
we achieved uh project goal i think  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
um yeah  
mm  
yeah  
i'd like to hear your thoughts  
okay  
i will send new  
<unk> front  
no  
i always have a mouse next to my laptop  
and draw it and it's it's placed over there  
yeah yeah true  
what kind of animal is that then  
flip  
mm-hmm  
to look at similar devices  
and the play doh <unk> yellow  
mm  
but since l. c. d. <unk> seems to be uh a definite yes so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend  
some people will say yeah but it's part of the thing or uh for instance in like in um also in uh  
'cause it's really a quite attractive thought isn't it  
nathan  
but  
and as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on you know printed  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah just uh concatenation of the no it's already there if you just put li festival  
yeah  
yeah  
some sam some samples then he assume somewhere some variable and point there is a change  
okay so what are you going to do between the data when you collect and this  
mm-hmm  
mm glow in the dark so  
yep colour sharpness  
nice  
so i investigated the remote control market in greater detail and my uh the theme of what i was to work on was uh trend watch  
broad line  
this <unk> um research that you've been doing <unk> looking at other you know existing units stuff  
and or um box  
yeah very  
so you may be the only one in the whole world now  
mm  
alright  
if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case the different looks of the case i would have probably drawn them up but  
but it's discrete uh no the  
uh and if an  
yeah barks yeah  
you industrial designers  
but we know that everyone has this and it's the same  
or not  
yeah  
and consider also that we all speak english here  
good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know people who are comparatively elderly  
okay so i did some research on the internet and um what you know the <unk> user interface are just aspects that are seen by users  
yeah  
which which is the clunky one the one on left or on the right  
so that you get so that you can't model it actually  
it i mean it's not that hard right  
i mean <unk> it's it's a detailed point i just wondered i mean <unk> how will people put these down i wonder  
programme problem  
yeah  
oh and you might want to add a uh infrared led  
so this one is leather <unk> based but  
or <unk> is there no problem  
yeah  
it is  
it's maybe it's not very uh easy for  
yeah  
is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons  
are we supposed to do this right now do you think or  
sense simplicity  
so the data that we wanna compare with a language or with whatever  
yeah i had the same  
i dunno it looks like you can <unk> control the volume with your thumb and then you could control the buttons with your fingers  
i wouldn't think so 'cause we could probably get it from like in bulk from a a newer company  
yeah true  
yeah  
okay  
way too much i think for our goal yeah  
'cause it's such a functional item  
a a a long lasting one  
i always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing  
yeah  
i uh personally think uh teletext is a good option  
uh-huh  
then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote  
yeah yeah  
that's how i understood it  
no  
so just to cover we have one more thing  
yes  
right  
and if you think it's it's not before uh but but must be reasonable i <unk> i mean if you think it will be not before december two thousand six  
yeah  
and uh we have to develop a solution here  
you can paint it afterward  
so wait  
but radio <unk> means radio loud <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
you're yeah <unk> so you're automatically producing the right format with this no um with just per utterance  
why don't i just  
how much will it cost for one hundred thousand  
yeah  
and uh which channel you want to choose and so on  
we uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that  
so there would have to have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons or something  
right i think  
um  
yep  
and i think putting four people in a three person room is already a sign that uh we are already quite uh quite full  
and any other class yeah  
and if you're a <unk> and you're coming and you don't necessarily expect to have a full blown office if you are only there for about two months  
we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the  
yeah yeah okay  
yeah  
so i'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category  
so we have channel buttons here  
yeah yeah  
well actually i don't quite agree  
oh just oh ma make it two special colours but we only have one button  
there i mean is that something we'd want to include do you think  
yeah  
yes  
close to  
it's good marketing  
indeed  
nice  
uh this is the local discourse structure  
that's right  
a very warm welcome again to everyone  
yeah  
you declare  
um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project  
mm-hmm  
if you don't know if you al already had a look or not  
yeah  
the essence of strawberry  
yes  
alright  
but enhanced relative to what  
okay  
um any ideas about that  
um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it <unk> it should function and all those kind of things  
<unk> the audio quality though  
hmm  
just press um function eight again  
okay um are the costs within the budget yes they are  
they those kind of materials they liked  
mm  
so  
to have i think they would do  
well this is <unk> this is how the <unk> calculated  
so you can see from that that you know  
yeah  
no yeah a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase  
i i  
ah <unk>  
oh well  
uh yeah  
yeah  
um we hadn't finished your  
what a what i if i put one here  
that actually will offer some extra protection for the  
<unk> uh uh <unk> yeah so i'll i'll lag in some of it during the i suppose there's the the <unk> movement itself for example  
but  
yeah  
and th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions  
i most people are right handed so maybe left handed special addition but okay  
we can put a scroll wheel on it or something  
what <unk> what uh what document  
mm-hmm  
plus the <unk> th the design round is still to come huh  
yeah  
so true true  
um on the left here we've got uh an engineering based design for a remote control so it's one that's got lots of buttons  
the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun  
alright  
it's gotta be safe to use it's gotta look cool  
possibly with flux as well though  
which are extracted i think uh  
and then you can use yellow or <unk>  
um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment  
yes  
that's all  
these are these are um some kinds of uh and this one  
well i was uh doubting about which one to take  
yeah  
yeah  
um then  
mm-hmm yeah  
looking at what we've got we we want an l. c. d. display with a spinning wheel  
mm  
yeah i was just gonna do some sort of informal evaluation  
how was lunch  
so do you know uh which way you give the feedback  
what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit enhance our sales  
yeah  
possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice maybe they got a cold or  
uh what i found was that say you had uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no i don't think anybody goes  
so yeah but evaluation  
i dunno <unk> i th i th i think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain but  
so you leave it alone  
we're looking at extreme simplicity  
no <unk> that <unk> that <unk> that would be more promising  
you say familiarity isn't important but  
there's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh <unk> the uh titanium was also an option  
no but you you have this yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
or a statue or something  
this is a standard time domain l. p. right  
so the conceptual specification by industrial designer the specification of the u. i. by or u. i. okay  
uh in  
kinetic we don't have it i suppose but we have solar cells  
mm-hmm  
and do we even uh prefer the sound above the the <unk> the lightning uh  
yeah  
well that's right  
the underside that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip  
what's what <unk> what could be the cost of uh well  
because um  
channels and all that <unk> flick onto  
i think yeah it's pretty interesting yeah  
yeah  
cool  
just this  
and we will never do it again  
i think they do  
but i think in this case in this case we've done the best we could  
um  
we can also use one light for  
and um it needs to be user friendly for um maybe for an example  
and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls  
hmm  
less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit  
yeah  
presentation  
<unk>  
oh it should okay yeah  
i see  
so it's everyone should know about it now  
what's the word for that  
which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity  
okay  
yeah  
actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better  
yes  
okay  
why not  
i love whiskers  
yeah  
um  
we're gonna have uh effectively two pages a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted  
i think that's nice yeah  
yeah yeah  
it shouldn't be boxy  
you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control  
well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen  
yeah  
i go for two because uh the the shapes are still round  
yep that's fine  
and the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with  
alright okay  
symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing  
this is fashionable with  
they make mountain bikes out of that don't they  
if this is your thumb and this is your hand like that  
um deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition  
uh maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there  
be yeah  
right  
right <unk> welcome to the the first meeting of uh real <unk> uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control  
yeah  
uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it um because its uh not so expensive  
so before deciding or before <unk> this project we must discuss all these things like and apart from this it should be having a good look also  
on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see  
well take it away  
yeah  
so once you we've tested the individually the card we can test to <unk> the audio and the video together  
one thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons  
it's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons  
oh right  
yeah i i i uh yes  
but i could give um the information about yeah how how important this is to each of those segments  
or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here  
but do you feel that is paper material  
mm-hmm  
so so we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway i'll fire up my thing  
so they have team elements  
treble bass  
mm-hmm  
great  
yeah  
they mostly work on dialogue management uh but not much on features and recognition  
ah you can <unk> you can you can use it if you so can we  
it can be <unk> yeah it can still be single curved but  
because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot  
so we're just trying to get records  
because um  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
we do get an error message with the project if we load everything into the project with all the data they load  
i'd have to hear it because it <unk> sounds like it could be a fragment  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
and there are moment where it is not  
franz <unk>  
say say it's regular regular chip and we still on fifteen so  
let's see what was left in the the another one  
so that it's better in your hand or something uh  
i can turn my computer quickly if that's okay  
mm-hmm  
mm yeah  
yeah the sound signal  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah that's true  
yeah i know  
maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or  
mm-hmm  
ah  
uh hello we're great  
right yeah  
is this like a banana type colour  
i like the kinetic energy source idea  
well no there was there was scratching and fighting but no  
well maybe it can have two shells a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside  
does anyone have any questions  
should we decide in the next couple of minutes and then  
um as you can see it was this earlier today  
volume  
they want to pay for comfort  
no i don't know if it's  
and we go with the slide here  
which others are are successful with one model and and you can maybe infer some some rules afterwards  
or install a laptop to a beamer or have this one standing here in an i i like it  
okay  
<unk> okay  
hmm  
i if you have th slides then yeah  
is that good  
right  
i have uh i've no idea i mean i should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it  
um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control  
yeah  
yeah i've missed that a lot  
right  
so um but that suggests he's at at the end of things but <unk> we could just ask him  
for example audio settings and screen settings  
why is it <unk> why is it squared  
because to get higher compression you have to you know take advantage of redundancy over longer time spans  
um well <unk> we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion  
no i will work fully on that on this point  
yeah  
oh i see right he wants them there because he so he can make it  
it's  
yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it basically  
so i'm left handed but i so i can say that most things are designed for right handed people  
and so we have buttons and using l. c. d.  
um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced  
alright i  
and stuff  
yeah it <unk> it should be easy enough to get but it's it's one other step  
alright  
yeah  
i think we have silver black and between those is like i dunno <unk> five colours between them or something  
and then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana  
well hang on  
yeah  
yeah  
uh that's nah that's true  
joystick here  
so  
etcetera to put them yeah  
um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up down left and right in the different menus  
uh one with a with a menu and one without a menu  
yeah okay  
oh yeah yeah sure that would be possible yeah  
how can you change from v. c. r. to uh t. v. by the way  
mm  
'cause have did you have all the materials  
i was thinking titanium myself  
maybe  
yeah  
or something like that  
from outside of <unk> we can access this  
'cause i think i think at the moment the g. d. f. format has <unk> in it  
oh like this  
yeah  
hmm  
we're still under twenty euros to build so we're good  
i'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together  
yeah but uh you <unk> you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
now it's your turn  
uh over there  
white board pens  
thanks project manager  
yeah  
yeah  
yes but you you get really close to the screen with your hand and i don't think that's  
yeah  
i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay  
yeah well <unk> but <unk> but the speak sample speaker is included  
oh you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these  
uh-huh  
yeah because the soft latex definitely is squishy  
i think we all have a presentation again so if we go through those and then um  
as a example  
um and all the other <unk> functionality is  
but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh <unk> makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques  
all you need is the reconstruction of the <unk> in order to estimate the harmonic <unk> and  
well actually we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually  
okay so laughter during speech  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
how satisfied are we  
it is  
yeah  
and so um  
okay so we <unk> we gonna evaluate the  
so <unk> buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with  
yes  
and then find it  
um  
mm-hmm  
i closed it  
exactly  
on there  
this is innovation yeah  
uh next one  
uh so i think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with  
because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other  
i i only speak for myself though  
and and so it the it just makes sense on the uh looking at the whole set  
yeah  
like playing around with look like it's playing with different weightings for that the utterance based one versus the word based one and sort of look at it <unk>  
be what we were told and they'd say yeah definitely  
mm-hmm  
have got got two examples here but i don't think there's anything we're missing  
oh here it is  
but anyway uh <unk> that's often the case  
yeah  
the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region whereas in another it'll be different so  
is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right  
we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing that's great  
'cause otherwise we need  
yeah  
yeah  
or even just like a paragraph of you know the basic idea  
yeah  
okay  
well there are universal <unk> um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the t. v. <unk>  
is it a white rabbit <unk> it's the white rabbit from the matrix  
we have to go  
'kay  
um  
yeah  
uh second and i think that's important for the marketing uh expert  
i'm gonna do an opening talk about um did you all get the minutes  
well that's you <unk> can try to convince us  
yeah  
four million  
normally it would take hour and a half  
mm-hmm  
we we never asked them it could be but um on the other side they have  
just  
<unk> ye  
unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to  
yeah that's right  
it's up to you means  
think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen  
so but but generally utterances is that which we just called uh sorry segments is that which we just called utterances now  
mm-hmm  
well eventually the hub is supposed to be forty percent non scenario  
right and we got say over  
yep  
it's really <unk> well designed  
no no kinetic  
ah a kind of uh snake  
okay yeah yeah well i <unk> i think an any uh any facets that we identify <unk> we aim need to aim for for all of  
yeah  
yes  
um  
yeah it's very easy  
the product is a <unk> real  
right  
no that's right  
no  
everyone is okay or four <unk>  
yes yes  
well we have to have buttons on it too as well  
uh no but as i know there is a range for uh for this uh <unk> for for uh for this stuff for designing this circuit  
like this idea that sort of if you start with a whole meeting series as one entity as one thing that you display as one whole sort of  
i hope if i have information about that i'm gonna  
then you only need to store the the the fundamental frequency and and the and the maximum voice frequency  
maybe just  
the microphone is a feature  
i've also got to get <unk> we well yes the <unk> the model builder  
right  
just go up to view  
biased  
okay well the animal i'd like to draw is a tiger  
yeah  
um  
mm  
yeah  
and just giving an id idea on the time we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most  
that's always the case  
leave it to one yeah  
and for the marketing guy  
i'm the marketing expert  
yep  
uh you have the best of both worlds  
television show it's gonna change the channel  
uh right well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family  
mm-hmm  
uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose  
so i think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and <unk> things like that  
okay  
integrated scroll wheel push button  
or what you  
and i like its overall uh aggressive look and  
mm-hmm  
but you know what i think we should put the threshold for that one in the end quite high anyway  
yeah  
suppose let <unk> uh find their find their own s. v. g. sort of find something that does s. v. g. and then we'll see if there's any problems  
um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um  
yeah  
yeah in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit maybe  
i think <unk> yeah  
<unk> uh technologically high standard  
okay mm-hmm  
get people talking and and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically  
hope so  
yeah  
they're talking fast  
it didn't work  
but <unk> don't we need a creative artist or something like that to <unk> make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit  
cos it would be costly  
we will  
there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle  
yeah  
four  
i think we probably want to store sorry  
or it's on uh your d. machine  
yeah  
yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form  
the only thing i can draw because it's very simple  
we see maybe we can move a little bit around just to give her uh  
writing the report won't be so bad  
take that one off  
so  
what user wants  
they know what they want  
i i go for seven  
uh or even maybe with we want video where it may be one or two frames i don't know  
um  
uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control  
well <unk> we look at the last slide see if it's got anything else  
per remote control yeah  
the  
okay  
and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them  
but i think you can read it  
with some things that was only problem but  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so basically what you're saying is you can take an arbitrary amount of data and process it with the same algorithm  
yeah well i think so too  
when you go to the sofa take your control and point it to the t. v.  
um so let's start with you  
yeah  
so that you say um s. p. s. s. and it goes to uh okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah there is  
yeah maybe  
it looks better  
yeah that that one is single curve isn't it  
uh based on um our marketing strategy on uh the latest trends on user preferences  
no it it could be little <unk> yeah it could be  
i mean it should be very intuitive <unk> yeah it should speak for itself  
have buttons  
ah ha  
yeah but uh they don't use the same signal uh on remote control  
so you have as you saw you have a little uh  
oh  
so i i prefer kinetic because it's uh well the costs aren't that much higher  
for the same costs it's can be uh in our  
mm  
okay  
okay  
ah <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
so this is the internal workings  
also not quite as feared as your average tiger but uh cats are one of my favourite animals they're very independent  
yeah  
thanks  
beep beep beep  
so uh <unk> yeah we need to do some tests  
um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um  
mm  
we will have to take advantage of these two things  
mm-hmm  
so but but but but yeah i think th th this kind of setup maybe web pages it's hard to find  
so um okay  
yeah that's kinda cool  
mm  
yeah  
volume down  
it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases as well as buttons  
and l. c. d. buttons  
for me this surprises me to some extent you know i'm uh i thought i mean you would you would be working on this  
yeah  
but i think if he sends to the i think if he sends to the port he'd probably be in a better position  
but until monday it's gonna be really bad  
which animal has not been drawn yet  
i <unk> i suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred  
yeah  
no  
have you ever seen a remote control like this  
yes i think so  
i'll give it a two  
yeah  
a  
yeah  
uh the menu select button  
three  
okay  
cars and you can tell that that's representing cars by looking at this distribution and it's the same for both  
maybe it's a two because <unk> uh the l. c. d. is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button  
mm-hmm  
yes  
right  
read only  
so this is going to be about the component design  
yeah that's um  
hmm  
mm  
well all t. v. <unk> but only t. only t. v. <unk> i guess  
miss mar miss marketing  
whatever i'll just put my ideas in uh  
some but  
yeah  
yeah i think so  
<unk> do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip  
you know  
uh or there was uh there was uh matthew and he said well probably we'll be coming to ask you because nobody really knows anymore at <unk>  
well the closing  
well it depends on your walls actually  
and that's just the wrong  
um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now  
it's no i have uh don't have the information for it  
yeah  
um so what i'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control  
the case will be double curved and uh rubber in a <unk> flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable  
that would be my feeling as well i think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface  
four million  
but just you know like the the the the round curves  
for a certain percentage at least  
sorry but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our  
you want the stuff  
if i was gonna place them i'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah i don't i really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore  
mm  
okay  
okay cool  
yeah but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so yeah  
again not doing anything  
two  
it still has your traditional black  
just as long as you <unk> took it into consideration what people would prefer  
yeah so powerful and easy to use  
yeah  
so you can get a really good grip on it  
yeah  
yeah  
we have the product we have the costs we have the possibility of everything  
um so so th yeah so just just been reading through documentation  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
and it can be used after uh tool for the measure work  
mm  
we've been putting in continuum flux  
uh  
it's rubbish but i love it  
well we have to decide all these things  
well if i can uh make a start i think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be  
um and then the different types of materials that you can use um i don't think you can use them in a combination  
trendy and of course user friendly  
yeah  
which programme you are <unk> watching or something  
user interface  
ah  
okay  
yeah <unk> <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> voting application  
no  
so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which <unk> uh who people  
uh room for creativity were we happy with that  
<unk> <unk> what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker  
yes  
because i received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on t. v. more where it seems that the market is more important  
six  
digital pen is useless  
mm-hmm  
but but that that two hundred this is what they use for like um <unk> they they do use this for um for um pitch marking in speech  
personally i don't really think that i want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale excuse the pun um in a year so  
um  
oops  
but the th but the way to think of this is this is the data that we want to be able to <unk> against the other tracks of data  
yeah just explain the button uh norman  
so we have the l. c. d.  
right  
i guess i guess we're going for the biggest market maybe not but  
pattern  
right  
so  
so um which then as i understand it would probably limit the  
i don't know what other options there are  
mm-hmm  
and for adults <unk> where you have more control you can see the one inside  
teamwork yeah he is uh  
okay  
yeah  
but i can but i can also deal with separate files i mean i can just write the algorithm that it loads all files in a directory or something  
but a turtle has  
so that's something we can discuss as well  
if you're using an advanced function right like um <unk> brightness contrast whatever it will just say you know it's like it only has four columns  
no th th i think they were <unk> reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing  
and uh it's also cheaper to produce  
<unk>  
<unk> i'll make it um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually  
okay  
of course we have uh  
yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account  
i think so too  
uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user  
hmm  
look and feel  
yeah yeah  
two  
okay  
so there you've got somebody who's doing theoretical development that would claim that you don't need two separate an analytical <unk> for these two types of activities that <unk> <unk> has identified  
then again we have the l. c. d. display which is also expensive  
so um yeah so just <unk> to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product  
six or  
okay  
meanwhile this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works  
do we put it somewhere over here  
oh okay  
uh maybe  
but i mean we tried so i think it that's that deserves a one  
yeah  
martin also reminded us that he is quite noisy  
yeah that's <unk> yeah  
okay 'cause the code version in the group directory is not the right one  
<unk> uh fifth channel divided by the <unk> by the by three hundred thirteen degree  
um so this is why we yeah we put maggie with with bruno  
oh no  
yeah the new requirements say so  
sorry it's okay  
yeah  
yeah that's right  
it might be useful to have some kind of base station  
look  
yeah but how are you gonna use that if your i mean if your remote control is lost  
i think this is what we talked about  
yeah  
and it's a very simple design there's not a lot to wrong the components are cheap to make  
i think we just need the um the r. r. yeah  
yeah  
so we have a a menu button and a <unk>  
when i'm drawing the orangutan  
l. p. c. will maybe  
because what's going to take time might be uh to select the type of restoration algorithm or the type of things  
and i <unk> will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes  
um  
yeah  
yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we <unk> we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right  
okay  
an it does how feasible it is  
but the feel of plastic isn't strong  
i dunno  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
let's check that out  
but it may be uh may be something to explore  
no  
well we'll have a look  
<unk> okay  
mm yeah  
i don't think we even know what the set of these things are that we want much less how to get 'em yet  
it can be  
right  
individually on uh your specific tasks and will <unk> we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next  
but do you  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
mm-hmm  
for up down left right  
yeah  
no and we have customers in multiple uh countries i think  
so just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one um  
possible transition between phonemes and some kind some uh more prior knowledge like uh which <unk> like uh which word is composed of which phonemes and uh <unk> uh gram grammatical knowledge ab uh about transition between words and things like this  
uh  
<unk>  
yeah they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this  
but okay i'm not i'm not really sure  
well see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image  
or or oh well  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
but it's like like a statue or something  
okay  
mm-hmm  
it's a read only version  
yes  
yeah  
where do i find this  
that one  
mm  
um fresh colours uh green red uh strawberry red uh yellow banana yellow  
mm  
i would've said about a two as well  
yeah  
did we  
but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti r. s. i. <unk> specific  
yeah  
i i uh i'll explain its uh the the components are listed over here  
mm-hmm  
um i dunno  
okay  
final  
and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form  
yeah mm  
um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled  
mm  
they're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before i don't think  
and for the meeting room has anyone got any more  
uh-huh  
wonderful  
okay  
that's right  
yeah  
hmm  
uh  
well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control  
maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time we make it look good and um fit the kind of idea of what they want  
um i'll have to look  
okay  
and this is other one  
so  
so whatever people want like if somebody want it in banana shape  
yeah is the same as the directory  
oh <unk> oh think this is uh  
so it's the number of different <unk>  
and then there is a special naming convention and you can remove the but i it's <unk> yeah it's true  
geez  
okay  
we have to do our uh two or three  
yeah  
i think we should lose the l. c. d. screen like you said  
first you you train uh well maybe <unk> it <unk> could be better if if if you take it into account  
for the buttons we have um an integrated push button which is oh just to say all all these are um supplied by real reaction  
mm-hmm  
okay  
the special colour  
and uh you can always find your remote control up  
no <unk> i it did change but just imagine we have  
definitely yeah  
uh the they are uh the <unk> because up to uh probably maybe we shall do mm it yeah  
<unk> out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important  
uh did any of you already do some work on this part or  
yeah  
uh  
<unk> <unk> <unk> for di for digital or um or for or for cable whatever you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels  
buttons  
okay  
but i'm sorry i don't figures on the difference in cost  
changing just the shape of the uh remote control  
and no no  
we we could make an option for it but uh you can disable <unk>  
so  
so um that'll be that'll be good  
mm-hmm  
so buttons  
that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons that um that their functions colours and forms aren't always helpful  
yeah that's right  
you mean uh in sinusoidal uh <unk>  
mm right  
yeah maybe we should see yours first  
but we still have thirteen left  
yeah th it it's i think that's not  
yeah sure but if you got if you got a tiny player it can  
and for <unk> for like the <unk> the calculations that we're doing apart from the search it seems that everyone needs some special representations anyway  
so are you <unk> what were <unk> you guys discussing  
yeah  
i think we decided on the <unk> right  
that's our remote control  
'cause i think i'm gonna be back  
um don't transcribe in breaths or out breaths  
or sorry the thick lines are windows actually  
down is channel down  
so without l. c. d. you want to put it <unk> the same level of <unk>  
technical aspects  
uh-huh  
i often lose my remote control the back of the couch some place  
well i hope that we still have a a lot of time for that because uh  
ah you have to know it  
uh-huh yeah  
it's true that it's someone coming next year susan reminded me this uh of this point and i could not really ignore it  
uh for the interface we have  
okay  
so if we for example now we have the <unk> the the case that this video is not correct because uh i have make uh event grabbing  
okay let's yeah  
mm-hmm  
yes but you can learn this thing all these functions  
but  
that would be actually very nice uh i figured  
i presumed it  
okay  
um  
so  
um simple regular advanced chip on print  
and where is the solar solar cell  
hmm  
yeah  
remote control which will be powerful  
yeah  
yeah <unk> <unk>  
okay  
not wool  
so yeah  
uh we should take some practice  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's quite a simple l. c. d. screen  
he looks more like a pig actually  
yeah  
hey babe  
double curved  
oh interface concept  
scratch and sniff  
yeah but as industrial designer do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television  
the difficulty <unk> would be in um i think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find  
if fact  
i di i didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun  
uh-huh  
fifteen  
mm  
okay  
huh  
there can be a um <unk> programmed answer for example  
well maybe it could be a universal design  
but maybe what we can already do is uh to decrease this uh this distance  
yeah  
do you um take it from from my directory  
and then if you know wind in the willows badger  
i agree  
ah i don't know what that is  
a special colour  
it'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it i think  
mm-hmm  
yes we could do that  
maybe in a colour or something that looks so <unk> really flashy but it it is also strong  
um <unk> favourite characteristics of it  
sorry  
yeah um i think it's good as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is  
well this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that  
oh yeah  
right  
uh not marking  
i don't think it's realistic for you to do so  
uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on  
yeah  
oh yes cool  
you have to search for them in in the in the <unk> in the screen in the menu  
so it's not this one  
yeah  
and yeah it's true that she's an assistant professor but uh well  
for example if you cannot find your uh controller you can just uh just just uh speak something such as yeah one two  
yeah  
you have to do something special i think  
yeah we dropped it  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
young users uh think that's an interesting idea  
yeah and do we put an l. c. d. display  
function  
yeah  
mm  
that's and we need it for ami plus other thing  
are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good  
i mean do you guys know what i mean  
because with the l. c. d. you need more requirements  
and i sup i think we'll have to evaluate th the product too  
yeah  
let's have a <unk> remote  
fish and chips  
yeah well it  
the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television and they're fairly basic  
so the voice recognition would be just an extra it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote  
mm  
it it adds a little <unk> extra high tech feeling to it  
so  
yeah  
i was think yeah i i think that i i understood wrong  
yes  
and um the second key thing is um it better be really clear to the people who are dealing with these codes um uh <unk> yeah  
okay  
no i just want to see something  
okay yeah yeah  
and i'm marketing  
no not mine yet  
yeah you yo yeah but most often not  
right  
but but that's easy <unk> uh it's easy to do because the the co each construct has the i. d. <unk> for the pa the things that construct it  
but i like i  
yeah me too  
so we cannot choose from it  
by themselves and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate  
okay but what uh what are other <unk> technical things we have to discuss  
tool training  
i think  
mm-hmm  
okay let's just get back to my schematic here  
um  
from d. v. d. player to television or something  
sure sure  
well it's uh the the <unk>  
anything else you guys can thing of  
um keep the primary buttons visible  
so like the top half one the bottom half the other  
flying off in all directions so that uh um uh again the <unk> need to look at the the the technicalities of um  
is it cents the the the fifty cents a button  
um  
okay that's a that's a good point  
and that's it  
uh well just about because uh  
but i mean that's not not a real problem  
power  
you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case we can't choose titanium  
i think i all wrong  
yeah  
so  
i don't know if that's one  
yeah it's if it has  
yeah that's  
if we have yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
and uh <unk> what people want  
it's a good idea but it's just not i don't think the market's ripe for that yet  
i think i it's kind of <unk> too  
it's quite interesting  
an so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role  
okay  
we use a normal battery  
and like the utterances come off of here maybe  
you you have time some more  
and that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun  
yeah  
i'll just try to <unk> uh things  
mm-hmm  
white or black  
uh i suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic  
there there are a couple of them that it's like <unk> out  
yeah i guess  
without l. c. d.  
okay  
and i think p. l. s. a. has this problem as well in is that uh the more topics you have  
narrow line emission should be in  
right  
you can put uh when the when the when uh <unk> the the the lowest part of it  
to flash  
yeah  
okay  
yeah thank you  
i dunno  
they have <unk> but they have a colour  
yeah  
uh we have budget problems  
yeah so if i mean i don't mind where it's done  
then i'll uh make something up  
one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that  
'cause in both cases you're um building up an argument publicly in this group meeting and then you know  
well  
<unk>  
we're here to have a kick off meeting for the design of a <unk> for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control  
<unk>  
mm  
yeah mu  
because uh there might be some uh <unk> influences  
well what are we actually doing  
yeah  
no no wait  
it's for  
and then there was this confusion about the um last spider phone conference that the messages telling people to call came out after the meeting happened  
okay so once you have say one hour of speech you start at the beginning and first you try with twenty milliseconds  
one one could imagine those two categories  
okay  
but let's not uh go too wide about the those things that's that why we're here  
well you got point five there  
twelve point five  
yeah  
this  
right so i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um  
special colour  
it's not ugly looking  
if <unk> if if it's too tight you know i think <unk> we can say four  
alright  
the problem we're gonna have is making it robust  
or it's sprinklers  
yeah  
but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience  
no  
okay  
the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera  
<unk> you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control  
oh  
finished  
a lot of buttons  
it's not that good in terms of uh direction  
because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the l. c. d. screen  
mm  
uh  
so so given a random page uh and these two models uh and the <unk> the words that these two models give which is more likely to  
there  
yes  
oh  
yes  
'kay you can go so  
no  
and what's the um if we use the <unk> i does it use much more energy or  
so um first uh mark and rama are going to present uh the prototype  
you have to push it together  
hmm  
uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design  
yeah i'm not sure either  
of the remote control  
right mm-hmm  
right <unk>  
it is a turn off <unk> turn off button maybe  
so  
i think we <unk> um  
yeah but <unk> how you need to know i  
well this is called the the the kick off meeting  
i think it mm  
yeah  
yeah  
indeed  
with <unk> uh additional uh how do you call them these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it  
so that'll be in  
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us um  
but  
uh and i'm assuming that the locator beacon the you know the  
yeah  
yeah so  
well uh um i'm hoping the dutch input will allow us to <unk> sort of have a rough idea of what was the of a suitable complexity for the task  
uh that that that's great  
and that's what the other stuff that's what the that's what the diagonal stripes are for  
well i suppose i could <unk> i could give you a call on the way in tomorrow and if th not bi it's not been in your in your <unk> um pigeon hole  
okay well thank you very much  
ye well we would look both at  
right  
oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a <unk> <unk> 'cause of the the white streaks in it  
and so that it you say uh good morning uh coffee maker and it says <unk> says to you back good morning joe or what's your name  
yeah  
seven  
yeah  
here's a <unk> series of different remote controls that are out on the market today  
low <unk>  
like maybe the r. r. can be yellow or something like that  
i think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh tim uh came with  
yeah  
but basically just the same  
so i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often  
yeah yeah  
well what about what you said like putting the  
well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in  
and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device  
uh where you started with yeah  
oh that's right  
yes but it uses two separate buttons  
so uh so i i it it <unk> what's actually i i <unk> just in <unk> i've figured it out that well  
mm-hmm  
but i think highest ranking is seven or one  
and they're they're totally separate  
um so here is the agenda for today  
uh will i i will explain  
well mm-hmm  
so we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two  
i agree  
yeah maybe it really depends on taste  
if you do not multi function then there is no <unk> point in having l. c. d.  
that's it  
okay  
okay welcome again  
it's cheap it's cheerful it's worked does work  
are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic  
now we actually have some ideas of what what people want what we should focus on  
okay  
i'm going to resign after this project anyway so  
mm so  
but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a <unk> kind of round shape i think  
good  
okay  
so i think this is really so this is one of the points respect to research of course  
mm-hmm  
okay good  
is that  
yeah  
um i'm not sure how the hand dynamo works they have yet to get back to me on that  
and  
and you i think i'm too short for the cables  
i'll c. c. her on the um  
would you like to go next  
yeah it should be available but then in separate screen settings or something  
yeah  
so actually that was a bad example 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response so  
of all rating  
i think we should use a f. p. g. a. for for the <unk> which is easy to to <unk>  
i have to do that so switch  
it it was it was  
'kay  
uh  
flips open  
even if we directly don't um advertise for the i go everywhere line  
except that if it is different  
mm  
i don't know like <unk> if start where the thing was found or if that thing wa was found it's in the middle of the part that we display  
and then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good  
scroll wheel with <unk> we had no  
oh yeah  
no it oh  
that exchanges are clear in um well i <unk> clearer in when you've got fewer people  
if you we uh yeah  
okay  
we're talking about existing technology  
uh twenty five  
so that would  
for example as i was if you make them big it may change the look of the thing also to the people  
okay  
okay and you should all be getting an email pretty soon  
thanks  
that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold out bay for more advanced functions for users  
how we can what the extra touch can be  
of unwrap phase <unk> uh i also use because you can do it here when you get into uh this domain where you apply uh or you're trying to compute uh <unk> power spectrum in in order <unk> let's say that this kind of trajectory  
might be  
but all the t. v. <unk> are uh equipped with infrared so  
okay so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one or as mm few buttons as possible mainly speak recognition  
are we  
yeah but i can reach in uh one second i can mute it down or or make a high volume  
there's still some merit on within utterances cutting out stuff which clearly isn't relevant at all and that maybe also for the audio we'd have to do  
well yeah that's why yeah  
the range should be a problem to that but if you want to uh get it working with a radio  
and i think we must look further to uh to <unk> <unk> develop something news  
yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen not that much  
no it's i think it's okay when you're not writing on there  
cool  
easy to change channels  
the technical stuff was brilliant  
because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu  
he he he  
it's not in the traditional place but um it's quite an obvious place  
either that or just have it by shape for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow  
<unk> your remote  
our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route we might have to look elsewhere  
mm-hmm  
it has to go to twelve right  
yeah  
so we should well we should make a wish list right as a side effect  
and uh well that's about it i think  
yes a good idea <unk>  
oh okay that's fine  
the off button the remote there be <unk> uh instruction on the screen please charge charge me  
um try out the <unk> by expressing our favourite animal and the <unk> characteristics of that animal  
something that's a little less crowded than this like i mean you know theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t. v. right  
you might have some background noise from the t. v. which will make the speech recognition much uh harder so  
yeah  
well it's just like a normal uh  
and i mean you could also you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well  
you talked about the buttons on the side  
oh right i think um hold on  
if you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video  
and also this was this year  
yeah  
so you have to know  
so you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana  
well not really and and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function  
uh <unk> you can how much what  
<unk> galactic lump  
yeah  
because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is <unk> being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below  
so  
well that's partly why i brought this up now is it i'm not sure what point down the data path things sort of happen  
mm-hmm  
we also have uh to do the evaluation uh the production costs and uh stuff  
with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i do you know what i mean  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
this  
yeah that's bad yeah  
because you are using because you are using <unk> if some people have p. d. a. they can use their p. d. a. to control the t. v. if they want to right  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item  
mm-hmm  
but  
well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do  
but flores  
okay  
yeah i'd prefer them drawn continuously  
okay  
yeah i say two  
yeah  
um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned it's basically designed around a banana  
could we yeah  
uh diodes uh bat batteries and uh uh led lights they're needed and they're uh everywhere available  
so i suppose  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
like totally yellow totally red  
<unk>  
hope everyone <unk> that uh  
the t. v. yeah  
well for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a <unk> lab  
uh-huh  
yeah  
that is my question also because like new new functions  
so  
also the <unk> the design should fit the hand shape  
index finger of your other hand or even i mean there's a whole variety you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger  
mm  
yeah but uh will we not uh  
anything else you need to know  
i have only a couple of things because i had i struggled a bit with the software that i'm supposed to use in this uh  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
mm  
i think the l. c. d. display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control but then again it's for young people  
they didn't write it with pen or something on a paper or saying that okay this is the best <unk>  
i think 'cause if you turn that into  
you're right  
in one go  
yeah kinda  
so that then you need five buttons and one integrated scroll wheel push button  
two three five two three <unk> and two  
yeah  
it's a different option yeah  
no you you i think you will use it only on the right or left hand whether you are righty or lefty  
et voila  
i <unk>  
hmm  
next meeting half an hour  
<unk>  
well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet so i mean i do the  
because you have uh you have um you don't have it only with <unk>  
and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have  
i didn't do us so much on that  
suppose you have to go to the t. v. and do it manually  
mm  
um  
i haven't been  
that's quite a lot  
yeah why the hell not  
ah these are like sensors  
scroll wheel  
so  
see how uh the one oh i'm not plugged in am i  
and we are now with four people but it well imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh  
mm  
yeah  
no no it is dead  
um should avoid <unk> things like that  
let's try  
if it's better or  
after they they want something new <unk> technologically speaking  
okay  
where's the good old chalk board with the  
this lapel is coming out once in a while  
any ideas  
batteries i think  
okay  
hmm  
i love cats because they're independent uh they pretty much know what they want they get it they move on  
and um  
no two and a half  
i think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable  
no no no no these these these ones like the  
is it  
source type  
no that's no comparison  
yeah okay  
brilliant  
yeah yeah  
so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says <unk> use the t. v. or use the v. c. r.  
that that just to to activate the screen  
yeah  
i i i have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt so but  
yeah  
no i i  
i wouldn't know  
both  
and my personal <unk> uh preference is uh as i said  
so  
uh that might be an idea but just a well furthermore uh well uh plastic versus rubber  
if you add those filters which are uh wider and wider this is that centre frequency which is somehow related to this one  
i'm uh not su  
yeah  
but uh uh for the uh opinion or thought uh stuff  
yeah well will we move on to user interface and yeah  
i  
yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like ipod mini  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
and what we get from that is this hilbert envelope right  
or oh okay  
who is psychology already uses <unk> that's still around  
i suppose so  
<unk> apparent that there are two functions for every button  
<unk> how we doing on our remote  
yeah  
what's what's nine megabyte  
would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here  
so it's pretty good  
is is yeah  
thank you team  
yeah  
oh  
no no no  
right you win  
so fifteen is about okay  
yeah that'd be much more efficient to do that  
so those are the only things that are worrying you <unk> and lab access  
oh no that's okay  
yeah but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it  
yeah but if it's if it's not useful i don't think it i don't think it gives an extra function to the remote  
mm-hmm  
like it's it's the <unk> it's sort of like one person's contribution at a time sort of thingy dingy  
but uh  
mm yeah  
again i think that's probably a good part if we had a slide <unk> um bar initially where we could <unk> adapt the threshold of what we yeah  
mm-hmm  
that's the thing  
snail  
i think so  
yeah that was it  
so i guess what i'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices  
seemingly  
something  
um as a final option  
yeah that would cover it  
yeah sure you sure we could do that but i don't that makes sense  
oh i'm sorry  
because it it it just works better  
sorry  
format  
yeah  
uh yeah  
yep  
doh  
yeah  
think of the <unk> for instance  
yeah  
i think <unk>  
okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting  
um i mean presumably he or she is not running subjects the entire  
yeah that sounds like an idea  
yeah <unk> just apply them next to the zero the one and the two  
ah the lemon t. v. with the pineapple remote control  
yeah  
is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful  
so or different different screens so  
but then also we'd have to find more sophisticated ways of loading it specifying the parameters  
uh-huh  
we would like not to have to rely yeah to a first p. d. f. version or any version of the document  
it's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly you know <unk> other people find it really cool  
so yeah um um  
'kay  
red maybe  
no  
um if somebody's gonna <unk> talk to the device you ideally want them to hold it to them  
yeah  
'cause um it could yeah  
yeah  
um and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use also known as the chip  
mm  
like a video tape goes forward backwards uh fast and stuff yeah  
uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah you can um i have some information about it  
i i thought we would just have like um one big summary um with all the uh different importance levels um displayed on it  
my dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark so i had to go through it and turn the brightness up  
hmm  
but with data sort of always combined from the whole series  
yeah if you're changing your mind  
continuum  
okay the second one i think is more of a gimmick then actually a <unk> thing it's a wind up you know a crank  
and then and then use um  
we were talking about it being more  
think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them  
it shows the relevant and most used functions  
a duck  
and you check with this which is your uh your your if you are right or not  
they're i just hold 'em like big bricks and they're very easily lost  
'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic something other than just standard  
so uh <unk> another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the t. v.  
do you believe it yourself  
that was a short meeting  
yeah exactly  
uh-huh  
there  
okay  
yeah it hasn't it doesn't have to be big  
you would have had a degree by now from e. p. f. l.  
okay so we'll have um  
thanks  
oh okay  
well it's  
fingers yeah  
like the power  
so  
except the switchboard  
mm-hmm  
maybe maybe  
so is it correct or no  
yeah  
and they <unk> them we've put in three person offices so that in the three person offices it's not constantly three people  
yeah  
yeah yeah sure yeah yeah  
um  
then we're gonna work you know from each of your presentations  
bravo  
mm yeah  
hmm  
okay  
uh-huh fair enough yeah  
not with rabbits no no  
yeah but i'd uh i would like to look at the frequency of words in my um in the regions of text i found out to be interesting  
then there's maybe  
mm-hmm  
uh the next question the next question  
yeah  
great  
yeah yeah yeah <unk> you you can do it  
okay  
yeah  
stuff like gets more and more <unk> complicated  
making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features  
yeah okay  
don't shake  
yeah we could probably like make a uh um graphic display initially at least for our experimenting  
you could put more covers on it <unk> one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to  
yeah  
so yes  
yes so they need no they need  
so you just mean which i is it closer to the is the circle i mean what is this circle  
hey  
the title and the information about the programme  
yeah i would say so as well  
out of forty nine i guess  
i would say  
<unk> right  
yeah  
contains only the necessary buttons  
<unk>  
mm  
it's uh what we are discussing about uh today  
but uh it did involve um eye movements and monitoring where they're looking compared to their hand movements and uh that subject  
okay  
should be better  
so ready  
that's my conclusion  
yeah  
wonderful  
i just had a question uh do you want to continue with your <unk>  
and then i <unk> had not list of available <unk> finances  
you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels so maybe <unk> they we can send that information along with standard t. v. uh  
um i think we dealt with the most important information  
or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss  
i mean all the work they that has done basically which is a huge work  
um  
be careful  
yeah no oh i see i see i see yeah  
yeah you <unk> recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff so if they already have it as uh as a chip  
yeah  
current remote controls do not match well the operating <unk> of the user  
exactly  
i think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there  
maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone  
i i it would be interesting  
and yes that's <unk> uh this will definitely this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales  
yeah  
so  
with sharp nails on  
rather not go for for that  
yeah  
ping  
okay  
otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes  
i don't know what happened there if it was detected as a shot transition or  
to find it  
uh  
good stuff  
yeah  
uh how popular was so it was <unk> still still quite popular amongst them  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so  
but but not to explain how the remote works  
yeah it's most <unk> this way  
you know that's everyone has a white remote control black remote control you need something cool  
teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used  
and if you're using that button a lot of times well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen  
but okay  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
speaker and um topic <unk> we'll need as well  
so maybe they can combine these two  
mm yeah very much  
that's okay then  
we have the simple regular and advanced  
mm  
and we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so  
and next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television  
uh  
yeah okay so let's stick <unk> to man <unk> for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later  
uh uh presentation people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button  
it's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the t. v. and that kind of uh thing  
um sebastian  
yeah  
that's right  
mm  
but again like  
riot  
mm  
yeah  
but then yeah  
huh  
okay  
it says that <unk> right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions  
what the uh just a duck  
i've seen it but  
mm  
yeah  
wheel wheel buttons  
because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have  
yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah <unk> a multifunctional navigation button  
right  
always the optimist  
yeah  
yeah can it be zero  
the  
but once i get to know the program probably i mean it looks better you know  
yeah  
there was <unk> on the she  
uh the other one is the uh the place of the <unk> office with <unk>  
oh and ma it's a prototype right  
that's our number one prototype  
right  
i <unk>  
okay  
yeah  
well what i'm trying to get at is is your start time gonna be delayed 'cause you don't have the models ready if she doesn't come through  
yeah more expensive  
ah  
yeah  
yeah  
just a shape  
right  
<unk> yeah  
<unk> our experiences with remote controls um our first ideas about this new remote anything that you can bring to the table for this project  
okay  
and um my computer's frozen  
when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control  
okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on t. v. and just to recognize gestures and voice  
uh well the only uh thing that don't  
okay um i guess since you're the marketing guy  
well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls  
maybe we can uh can do it both  
yeah  
yeah <unk> not too heavy  
an elephant  
but um yeah  
examples and see if there is anything  
we met before  
personally  
mm-hmm  
it was somewhere in something like this  
no that's getting a bit  
right well i guess that's us  
you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well  
okay  
well i think we we we all know what the redesign should be  
a little bit  
we should be fine  
which is  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
and plus it can give you a voice activity detection  
i would agree with you  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
um sure  
a head  
so so is your complaint less about um less about knowing what makes an exchange and more about knowing how you <unk> exchanges for this genre  
but then then i think left handed people are already used to discrimination anyway so they just  
so it's not related to <unk>  
<unk> either or  
there is more findings  
but if we had um some sort of hook up to your computer as an option then if you've got a computer you can avoid that  
okay  
okay like we could have a big banana shaped remote control 'cause it's yellow fruit right  
and uh if you have any question  
uh project announcement  
yeah  
don't use my opinion  
so i already uh put some <unk> some numbers here okay  
but then here it comes that there at some point there might be a correlation there  
yeah that's kind of uh  
yeah  
yeah  
so minor modification needed for  
oh no no i was thinking of <unk> just into some machine and then just <unk> it from there  
even for <unk>  
and we evaluated  
yeah  
so i think we should specify some <unk> requirements if we want to use a voice commands  
um  
right  
older  
and we can just more or less look at their code like how their player moves forward  
at the time  
hmm  
okay  
but i th i think there are other other people have looked at exchange structure and described it in these terms in a way that should really suit your needs  
yeah  
um it shouldn't because things are going to be left like the asterisk will be left for the <unk> the subsequent processing  
it's pretty good uh  
you can have a look  
i think no we are wired  
yep  
i thought so but maybe with the  
you know the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time  
stay  
i'm not too keen on them anyway  
no you know i think i mean the way java works is that <unk>  
it uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us  
uh i in the the first shot  
hmm  
mm  
it doesn't have to match  
for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something you know what i mean like  
so you got your buttons one to nine your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it  
it was a line with hashes and it was hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash hash  
which is apparently black and yellow but  
okay  
hmm you knocked it up  
you you can you can use yeah you can use the button option  
no no no no no i uh probably might  
if but i say if if people are getting r. s. i. from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market <unk>  
okay  
okay  
um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about it needs to be original trendy and user friendly  
i'm sorry about the names i don't really know uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic  
so i see this as you know  
to move to another target  
big brother  
target  
um the temporary light up idea sounds like we're gonna stick to that  
say another another example apart from uh this uh search  
i found twelve questions so much but it still is ten  
what is that  
that's all  
or no  
most of it mm-hmm  
or something  
right  
'cause sometimes look at this computer th this laptop it's all black and uh it's quite conventional  
we have two points spare  
rather four buttons  
uh well it might  
so that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption  
there you go  
i like the little cover <unk>  
it certainly is an expensive material i'm aware of that but i was given an okay  
and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something  
and then you <unk> question you know second guess whether it's really what you heard  
the remote control has got a really trendy look  
um so my <unk> i should get everything working on the um yeah on monday  
<unk> three i mean four credits  
it's speech  
from a total waste of time to you know  
no that's not necessary  
yeah i i i just want would like to stress something is that um yeah  
mm-hmm  
transfers to some sending mechanism which <unk> it  
i don't mind  
like with a banana you can have  
and they have to get out to us some way  
okay uh if we're still all with us  
uh i would to say the cheap meeting room system  
that's  
top  
we'll get something to print out their locations  
the younger uh  
um  
do not forget it  
um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user oriented remote something simple  
maybe four weeks  
keeping things <unk> well uh you know ho hopefully uh keeping things together  
so we have um true  
directly available  
okay  
wait for emails  
yeah  
it's another fire wire or not fire wire but um  
do you want yeah open  
mm yeah i'm impressed  
i think  
mm-hmm  
what is this  
and we're done  
so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get one  
oh  
okay  
but i don't know it's probably not too bad  
yeah  
but just thinking um people probably i mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the t. v. once  
could have one for your stereo one for your d. v. player  
okay good that's very clear  
okay  
okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing  
but  
ooh  
except for the <unk> the the red button they because for want of a  
well <unk> you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts of course  
uh  
yeah  
<unk> everybody is is free to uh say <unk> whatever they want uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh  
um  
the logo at the bottom  
i think they do 'cause that's the first um sixty percent or isn't it  
oh right yes let's have a look at the um  
well we uh it's it isn't a <unk> a most uh costly uh remote control  
okay  
yeah  
yeah then then we would be in the <unk> budget  
to make it happen  
but that's just an idea  
so but we'll come back on that  
yeah  
yeah  
because if we do have enough um space in in our finance i would say do integrate it because  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so we are just doing f. f. t. right  
but um depends what <unk> we want  
um likewise i've three different roles for each stage of design  
yeah but how would you like to implement that that you say volume up and then it goes up or  
um what was i missed the last moment reading that  
okay  
who are you  
true  
format save  
um there line below  
the just s.  
it's about so the total cost if you if you want all the <unk> <unk> will be about uh fifteen dollars  
and  
uh ten yeah  
project  
whereas a <unk> so cheap and easy and <unk> and everything else  
yeah  
you don't know that  
remotes overwhelmed with buttons  
can you explain what you want us to write there  
i don't know  
i guess we'll just hit the bricks  
ah okay  
ah okay  
maybe it's been targeted  
i don't know  
just give us a bit of  
that's great  
yeah  
um as a what's the <unk> there's <unk> there's a training set and then there's the development set and then there's the test set  
it shouldn't be highlighted you're right  
yeah  
yes that's uh really possible  
with a with a mirror huh  
right  
no nothing <unk> much to talk about this  
so what about company strategy  
so okay we've been talking about evaluation <unk> in the first report and there's nothing new we can say about it this time  
um well during the meeting i showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top usable with your thumb  
this is i yeah <unk>  
do you see something else  
think they say um quite a lot of numbers and before that uh um there's this number  
the little holes maybe  
and then then we combine  
that's like a button on your t. v.  
okay  
it's that that simple  
the solar cell is too expensive  
yeah inside the car yeah  
superb sketch by the way  
it's true it's a one  
and we work on slightly different schedules too 'cause maria and i tend to work earlier and nancy tends to work later  
um you can choose the format um sorry  
okay  
'cause uh <unk> i i i i thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh  
so maybe you can just check no i it's it's here on the web then it won't come with your linux software  
yeah  
i dunno  
and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time  
well just give it a two  
now  
yeah we've been told  
actually i don't think it really says anything about the cost but it says that it's already in the coffee machines so  
no they're all called something slightly different  
yep  
yes  
it's not really that responsive no  
uh i then it doesn't matter where it is my well it's we should be in range  
um the and they're bussing people into station have particular problems on it 'cause it's on a 'cause it's on a hill or something  
but means <unk> and uh i if they they cannot recover it then then what they will they won't charge anything from you for the inspection  
also huh uh-huh the buttons are they easy to find  
three  
nah you'd see it anyway if you hear it  
and this um  
it's a pineapple now it has changed  
mm 'kay  
that's excellent  
so when i <unk> when i have to have an l. c. d. <unk> <unk> window  
yeah i think it made we met all of the consumer  
so maybe um i guess that that's something you two uh need to think about  
yeah  
i don't think so  
it's a complex linear prediction or whatever  
<unk> not an expert on these things but presumably there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify  
for drawings yes  
one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this i mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics right  
star bursts count surely  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
okay let's talk about all of our  
give it a kind of a home style like we have i  
okay  
when you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals  
no that's a definition wherein a construct has a <unk> has constructs as children  
i would go for  
oh okay  
okay  
<unk>  
mm  
the chip which um then sends  
the round shapes  
yeah  
that's enough  
yeah  
okay  
okay the final point trends  
yeah <unk> what  
gets old yeah  
yeah  
yeah i think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices  
mm  
yeah  
and i believe even that the <unk> the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with exactly  
yeah  
but i'll check it out anyway  
so what i want to make sure is that we don't um simplify do you know what i mean  
speech recognition  
he use i he got some problem with hands and then he was always using this <unk> uh dictation even he used to write lot of c. plus plus code with the dictation like  
<unk>  
don't throw anything away  
yeah  
uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time time's short  
well uh yeah  
yeah  
so we gotta keep that in that in mind  
yes i think you're right  
it's probably just those people have to work together a lot and very closely and just make sure that they're always <unk> understand what the other one is doing  
and  
click on it again selects features scroll adjust it  
and i as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction  
the general office  
um as you can see it's supposed to be original trendy and user friendly  
um let's see  
just wanted to know if i'm just  
i see i  
that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use  
okay  
no no you don't no no you don't need it  
yeah i didn't actually see  
it's nice i think  
yeah  
high tech  
not the only ways you can use  
and uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process  
if you want the <unk> fancy l. c. d. display  
just bring more designs on the market  
and that yeah well i mean isn't that what we just <unk> said said we <unk> just have to decide now  
okay  
like a little cut out kind of  
so um so my personal opinion  
yes i i'm sure i've followed that rule sometimes and just forgotten  
yeah  
i think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber  
hmm  
okay thank you  
well uh i was going for the r. c. deluxe but it's not really a catchy name or anything it's more  
uh well hopefully  
okay  
maybe we can do the  
two or three  
that's brightness colour tone all that  
okay  
it won't doesn't maybe we should start with the the technical functions  
well it was yellow  
um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product  
um and i don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the i dunno  
so i i i i  
well the kinetic thing yeah  
yeah  
and we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh  
mm-hmm  
or we can have something that looks a bit nicer i think it um won't necessarily <unk> uh look like a pineapple but um  
okay  
yeah that's true  
so what you want is one track of information about which object it's one one about whether or not it's on the other guy's gaze  
um  
no <unk> not specifically  
yeah okay so we  
yes yes  
well i should i think two because the voice recorder is <unk> not self learning  
no it was up there but i couldn't see it down here  
it's impossible  
yeah  
uh i'm taking notes  
yep  
uh okay  
yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now  
so let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print  
um uh sorry the only problem with the first meeting is for ex that there's no um a hot spot annotation for that  
what's  
yeah  
different pen widths how do you do that  
yeah i think it's good  
yeah  
he's got uh a new model that's it's published in nips this year but his co author put it on their web site a month or two ago  
a kind of identification okay  
uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us  
um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control  
um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em  
mm-hmm  
will be uh  
this one is empty  
uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light  
yeah  
but a lot of the <unk> that we use  
or to the number of image in the pages or anything  
um  
okay  
okay  
yeah so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations  
the future demand market demand  
yeah  
and so there'll be a bit of a a sort uh some sort of overlap of two objects  
so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so  
yeah of course  
if it if it's a button or okay  
it is true  
and i had to tell tell them when to press the button to turn the page  
<unk> well sounds sounds reasonable  
uh i think it's not possible to look that up  
so i mean there are i we definitely priced out a spongy even <unk> non natural look um materials which i think worked out fine  
so um uh we should we should keep uh the the product should be <unk>  
yeah  
that is important  
and yep  
now satisfaction with for example room for creativity leadership teamwork means et cetera <unk> digital pens et cetera  
um  
okay  
okay  
they always worked on manual transcriptions of documents  
spreadsheet  
is that you all have all finished or  
okay  
top  
then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the the special material the rubber wood titanium et cetera  
so uh selling price uh would be uh yeah  
it's <unk>  
exactly  
but i think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour 'cause you have to add it  
yeah that that's that's so that's one of the issue i mean that uh maybe don't know <unk> whether you <unk>  
i mean all components  
okay  
let's see what we can find here  
it's okay  
uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work  
right  
well that's all about my uh my findings  
is that zoom in  
because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working  
so um this isn't yeah  
well it would it would be a solution for uh when your  
no we're uh ahead of schedule then  
uh  
<unk> younger people  
furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world for different cultures maybe because we want to we want to well fifty million  
multifunctional and  
yeah  
okay here we go  
i second that  
makes new paper  
yeah  
but right  
i is there any of these criteria that need any explaining  
yeah  
maybe that's the problem  
um now i'll look at show this board  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours  
well what's the smallest chunk at the moment you're thinking of of assigning an importance measure to is it a word or is it an utterance  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
mm  
now you can clearly see young users say  
celebration  
yep  
so do you think that we should do the lighting up thing and the glow in the dark thing and the shape of the numbers  
yeah  
um and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons  
so then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons  
oh well it's it has been used for speech coding  
ho how how do they how do they evaluate  
yeah  
why do we have to do it in memory  
and i is it uh expensive to do  
ah i've got it  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yep  
um i guess it's two since one for the top one for the bottom  
the the method we used uh it it's not <unk> not a slide because it went wrong but the method we use uh  
same here  
fancy  
thank you  
so  
go for it  
so we don't know we don't know  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah <unk>  
yeah well  
uh sorry got a message from microsoft  
um oh i still haven't got my glasses on  
uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the <unk> the technical of if it's uh it's possible technical wise  
ah yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
although if if you had a big thing and it was jiggling around like anybody's business  
um and that would only add buttons  
i <unk> think so  
so perhaps some sort of menu based thing or  
good work as a design team because we  
so where's the volume  
mm-hmm  
so maybe we can start with this uh calling this one  
which ones were yours  
but i think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up  
yeah  
anyway uh i think the the details of the implementation is not that important  
people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote  
um  
for the uh menu what do we use for that  
that is why fruit and <unk> being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion  
uh-huh uh-huh  
yeah with the button that you pressed  
the default track  
the twelve buttons that you see there  
what i said about uh the remote control sending another signal that that might not be true  
okay  
you will listen to a peep special peep  
the it should still come out that the little sketch i asked this <unk> for for last week about n. x. t. and whether it would have that sort of tiered effect so you could see the overlap of where one person is looking compared to the other and their mouse movements and things  
yeah  
okay i think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have  
so a six more  
but if there's any time <unk> hmm  
but i don't know if i had i copied all the numbers that are on that so  
mm  
<unk> technical <unk>  
as far as i know it's hard wired  
so now you are saying you have no time  
no no that's just a simple chip  
oh i see the on <unk> in the back  
so we can turn this ball to <unk> to select channel  
and  
um if next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well  
uh yeah  
just use this one uh during the day  
so so  
um we're targeting young people now because our um  
times per hour  
mm right  
mm-hmm  
and the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls  
let's  
so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition  
we can ask we can try to ask maybe if some person for six months so that your role is simply to help and advise  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so we did it in the map task  
okay understand  
okay  
yeah  
um  
oh right yeah i see what you mean  
yeah yeah yeah  
i would say yeah  
next piece okay  
so uh that was on  
or is it for every single thing in  
<unk>  
reusable  
yeah it says  
um  
mm-hmm  
try to learn from your mistake  
there are three thingy if it's way at the bottom  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> yeah yeah yeah <unk> yeah just this little bit is that i think that's still um a video remote part  
um  
yeah so  
and we don't have much time  
mm  
it doesn't <unk> quite fit in with the trendy well obviously it does if that's the current theme  
okay so basically what has been uh yeah extracted is yeah this point rather than okay so this is normal okay  
um there are two target audi audiences and we've uh chose for the younger one  
everything's better than your bird  
are we technologically innovative  
okay  
yeah  
sometimes  
pretty straightforward  
uh-huh  
more uh uh public i think  
yeah  
um no i have to bin it up and so i will only have counts for each each bin or something  
less important  
so as you scroll through 'cause we said we might have a jog dial  
yes  
for example <unk> <unk> i can recover everything on <unk> because i have it on the c. d.  
yeah  
very interesting  
not quite sure how this is gonna work  
and then we're gonna have lunch break  
i don't know  
sorry alright  
th yes they can  
um so yeah i guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good  
yeah  
that's i think it's easier  
i'd say continuum flux but i don't obviously  
right  
'cause you wanted to see them right  
no  
mm-hmm  
and throw it  
yeah that's true  
two hundred and fifteen to go  
narrow line a. g. n. are different  
yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone  
or we could say neutral we 'cause we scratched the  
um on off up and down channels up and down volume and uh skip to a channel  
that's right  
yeah okay that's seven and one to activate the menu yeah  
that's true  
mm-hmm  
it will sound different than if it than into if it is just a back channel  
yeah  
yeah  
oh  
but  
so  
ah  
mm-hmm okay  
you have the basic idea  
yeah  
it just beeps  
yeah maybe it has some <unk> patches yeah  
oh  
i don't  
doodle  
uh that's my job  
so if it's from <unk> well actually i think if it's mounted you can directly burn from there  
uh i suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to  
uh-huh  
we really want to focus on the remote control for the television  
yeah  
i think energy were batteries and then uh and uh yeah  
yeah  
but that won't be a problem  
no  
yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here  
of course this can be discussed but let's let's see so let's vote  
yeah we have to kind of work together  
yes  
uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like rather than changing the whole kit and <unk>  
that's difficult  
yeah we did it before  
i don't know what special colour means  
something i neglected from my initial research is that real reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion and clothing fashion  
so you can't do any partitions  
'cause um i have to check back with  
well that's to put it very blunt that's not our problem  
i mean  
we've got <unk>  
ah colour  
and the production cost should be the half of the selling price  
i guess i have to change the pen otherwise  
yeah so we meet in well what are our  
so interface uh i have four things to offer <unk> uh normal push buttons of course  
<unk> you're gonna end up hating in a year you know  
that's with the l. c.  
yeah  
yeah that's that's if you want to do it sebastian  
so the only only solution is either to use the <unk> <unk> lose the yellow or lose the rubber  
yeah  
speech recognition right okay  
nah that's alright that's alright  
mm  
we could make novelty remote controls  
right  
i yeah  
sure  
mm-hmm  
um gauge  
or just or any <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
it it it might last one year and next year it be uh can be totally different  
like a phone yeah like the backlight in a phone  
probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned  
yeah it will still appear continuous on the display  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
well  
i think people who are maybe about i wouldn't say thirty five  
but we don't have to integrate all these complicated features  
uh well you can see uh  
um i would say we're probably at four  
that just represents the infrared uh beam  
plastic  
but we still have to look at our price of course  
so you don't have to choose among hundred channels if you have hundred channels you just have six buttons seven buttons  
and what what's your choice  
uh slide show  
no what was it about  
and also any number as a word type of its own  
you don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the <unk> floor and breaking it or whatever  
i can't remember um how this works now 'cause it was a while ago  
okay  
yeah  
is it hard  
but yeah  
so  
um j. p. staggered away from it and  
is that agreeable to everyone  
i will need it  
plastic for the casing and a power source whatever power source we've actually determined we want  
yeah because uh when you touch the l. c. d. screen when it is in standby mode it should pop on  
oh no  
we're on time  
maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands  
okay  
that's not a special colour  
yeah <unk> yeah like she told  
okay i will close this  
well we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour  
and they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework  
<unk> <unk> un to be one what would do we nee actually yeah i don't see okay one would would be without buttons  
look on that  
cool device  
yeah  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
no i mean that's what that's like fifteen pounds  
i don't know anything beyond what fancy means but that's particularly of use to us i think  
if you drop it  
so my point is when  
um short words and word fragments  
um so i we can see the video actually uh the entire video can open with real player  
<unk> emission  
so  
do you want to switch places  
but <unk> <unk> oh yeah  
okay  
uh i also will propose some uh um  
yeah here we are  
so you can put it in the dark  
yeah because yeah  
um and  
i'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech <unk> if you want to put a speech recognition system <unk> interface for that i think the t. v. itself could have it  
error measure  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and <unk> audio function  
it's not working yet but it will do  
yeah maybe the then  
for the menu  
at the moment we have people <unk> sharing like three people in a room without any partitions and  
mm um  
yeah but it's a special colour than just rubber colour  
that that's nice  
um so dave can you just turn this what we have right now in  
yeah  
what if you get a response two or three months from now  
that one's <unk> and that one's <unk> and it doesn't really tell you what it does  
ah wait <unk> screw in  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
um  
it's probably the <unk> cover itself legally i think by doing this  
that would be me  
yeah yeah yeah  
the for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing  
yeah we have the the power adaptor products  
right  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that goes also for the scroll wheel by the way  
i'd say a two  
okay  
and we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly  
so i is so the thing is you can find out how much an l. c. d. will cost and then we'll decide again  
mm-hmm  
because you can't use a panasonic uh remote control on a on a philips television  
yeah  
and then go back and check the the silence regions  
okay okay  
um the way that we're going to go about this is um we'll have a time where we can um  
mm  
eh  
whether you detect it  
two two two  
yeah  
it's curved  
that's  
yes  
is that the question  
but but uh yeah what he said was right about the televisions they have to be uh <unk> to the  
yeah  
like you get a yellow uh remote control red one blue one et cetera  
like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers  
yeah  
you just didn't try  
so in that sense it's doing something a bit different  
does it come up together or disappear one of them or what  
okay  
so i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh i explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen <unk> euros  
when you when you use a remote do you press the buttons with your thumb usually  
yeah actually i need the raw text as well  
i know  
z. equals two is um means at a certain distance  
i don't think there's really much point in doing like that when it's just gonna feed off in the end the information density measure basically  
um are they still in the business  
yeah  
i'm not sure  
and it will be decoded by the t. v. and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the t. v. and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver  
yeah  
that's why i was looking over your shoulder  
yeah it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem  
okay  
well did you really uh  
and because i alright it's not our target audience but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people  
uh this is the better pen  
yeah yeah  
it's the colour of a  
upper management said yes  
would you consider doing a talk instead because uh particularly the second and third years  
we are talking something more complicated of course it's going to be more expensive as well  
exactly  
the object  
okay  
it's even easier because what you have to do is just divide the you just multiply that hilbert envelope by the table carrier  
but  
finish meeting now  
yeah  
yeah  
if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all  
you know from the the the basics to the <unk> although the whole concepts thing the whole concepts phase i don't think i really understood like the concept  
and if not if it's not the case <unk> you would have to redesign it  
or maybe we should finish with this first  
if we take another cover for instance black then we also need another button frame 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously  
and um most the dice machines don't have working sound cards  
it's like you have uh four phones  
and um although mo most people will buy <unk>  
so we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people  
and then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever i dunno  
yeah  
yeah it's great  
you know look at the front but  
so the things which are related to your p. l. p. can be done i think it's it's not such a major problem  
i think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function  
but  
makes it in a homogeneous uh design  
now  
so we tend to use always the same words  
that's not bad at all  
yeah  
well actually we should have it the other way around i guess  
i have an a web page yes  
okay  
so well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them  
no you can't  
ah well if no one else wants to yeah  
mm  
yep  
still feels quite primitive  
so it's just the time in to the time out  
okay  
okay  
no no no no he is using different setup i think  
yeah with the cover  
we've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we or is it some other thing that's not on there  
and so so nate <unk> tried to okay so you know  
but uh it's not so easy to implement it right  
i'm not  
yeah  
do you make all the buttons  
what's um will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product  
the all the guys in the profit sharing yeah  
like in  
four  
yeah  
and it's uh <unk>  
i think it's slightly better um  
so to me it's about selling <unk> uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product  
which i haven't because it always fucks up on my system  
right  
<unk> oh it's on sorry we unplugged it  
okay so probably what you'd want to do is um  
and we're going to raise what's called a <unk> a spreadsheet that they provided to me  
go for it  
mm mm  
but he uses d. c. t. and then he <unk> uh so the so so and it and les is excellent guy  
then that'll be really easy to do once they've got the raw text  
mm-hmm  
exactly so the visitors are uh basically <unk> and it happens that sometimes we have two of them even if it's only for three or four month  
technical  
and the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that and then the basic function just on the device itself  
uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well or titanium or even wood  
yeah  
then i don't think rechargeable is something we should you know we really need to care about  
okay  
um so design preferences um we need easy to read like large buttons clearly labelled so that i mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem  
yeah  
from the other end of the room or something  
this is uh like the  
and don't forget we need to include the colour  
that's how it's is usually when i look here  
or just redesign  
so um the more active you are the more band width you use  
yeah th you have the vocal commands  
so  
okay  
yeah <unk> yeah that's what <unk> i i was pointing at  
yeah  
i think it's okay  
mm-hmm  
okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly  
ah there's one with the equivalent width  
mm-hmm  
so all we do is treat the whole lot as one massive document  
so i need a product  
at the end circuit there is an infrared led  
hmm  
yep  
um the detailed design i i guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other  
okay  
at the moment our best guess is that it was some stupid java thing about if you if you actually if you have two objects and you say object if you say a. equals b.  
functional  
yeah  
yes i did  
well as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng i mean producing electricity from mechanical energy  
it's only ha putting the bottom line because olivia would've marked from blue all the way to the end as one long line  
okay things like um brightness contrast um maybe tuning the channels  
okay  
okay  
so  
yeah  
alright yeah  
yeah  
rubble double double  
around six seven seconds  
carved into the material  
so we could at least think it's sort of an open place  
because if they're looking directly at it it's obscuring  
and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh <unk> slow pause or <unk> slow lo yeah <unk> pause or stop  
yeah  
if you mark them as being more interesting than the words which are only very general words that they would get us somewhere  
um so it's four thirty so we need one hour it's it's good  
mm i suppose but <unk> there is the off chance that you know th the brightness is wrong on your t. v. or the contrast needs changing  
or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow  
as for the single curve  
it said bo both the options  
and we're gonna maybe <unk> try and have to figure out  
if you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it just like yellow with the r. r.  
so sorry could describe that again the  
yeah  
um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls  
um  
you have the total of seventeen euros in production cost which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use  
okay  
at some times i sometimes i received like like five emails at at one moment and then  
yeah  
so when  
mm-hmm  
and it will that <unk> utterance will always be in the summary  
yeah  
sure  
yeah  
uh not a very good one  
you'll have some rules about how maybe how long you spend on other objects and <unk> whether the other object is um the existing construction or not right  
yeah the that wouldn't be the remote so much i mean  
train north  
two t. v. <unk>  
um yeah  
depends how fast your television runs really don't don't you think  
but i mean i <unk> i don't i'm not sure i see the value in these  
i think i think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side  
i think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay  
oh you know like in circular in shape or  
et cetera  
make  
yeah true  
yeah  
um  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
ah  
like  
eh for th the vocal command yes it's might be easy  
okay  
okay  
we <unk> we do have uh the rubber we do have the colours  
well <unk> depends with how you do it  
draws  
okay  
uh no no no  
but we've got emission line in the ratios  
for the case uh well uh i think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote  
also their grasp of algebra is terrible  
no then the whole concept is uh  
oh you you made the entire could you  
so if this lazy loading works then this should definitely fit into i mean not memory then because it wouldn't all be in memory at the same time  
mm  
so i think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using  
okay  
so they have uh some flow charts of the uh uh detailed analysis of uh uh exchange structure yeah  
is this uh  
right okay yeah  
okay  
okay yeah  
instead of having a ten year guarantee  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk>  
yep yep  
okay  
hmm  
i i'm trying to choose my language carefully because we're being recorded  
that says go here  
um which affected over a quarter of users  
this is it has to be compatible with other things  
i mean maybe just maybe if you just put  
if you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying  
no  
you can go uh  
yeah well as far as i've got at the moment i've made a results class that's got like the i. d. and the stuff  
okay  
we have to i have to catch you sorry  
yeah  
cool  
so  
but uh th youth doesn't care about <unk> functionality so  
then you can merge them together to  
so now is the final evaluation final evaluation of the uh uh of our product  
which i don't know if anybody actually knows is there  
well don't we need plastic and  
three  
so well  
yeah yeah  
where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of okay we're talking about this  
is it from c. m. u.  
mm  
i mean minus you guys being <unk> what is it the survey annoying or what is it  
enter uh when user is  
they either have to both stay or both go and i i think they should stay  
because if they're willing to pay more  
and then uh the remote control uh reports itself so <unk> we should use have uh we should use something like that  
think <unk>  
um so this is only for to get in the menu or to exit it  
we'll see  
so somebody should sort of be the one person who's who understands most about what's <unk> centrally going on with with the with the project  
yes  
the one i have doesn't have the four on i like around it i don't think  
special form also it says  
um clunky in what sense like um <unk> heavier  
which ones are they  
so do we have anything else to discuss  
okay  
i think you have to come here  
okay  
and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device too  
and then only it safe to put well not twenty but it's always yeah yeah of course  
things yeah  
it was it as a shot okay  
so  
no  
but the important thing is this is <unk> based on i i <unk> i'm always pointing at my screen and you don't see  
hmm  
but but but still li like the the the work i did on on hyperlinks like i used uh <unk>  
hmm  
well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing  
yeah  
yeah i think i've  
so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue  
i think i just i just used the mouse on there  
you didn't put it in  
it's like right in the  
but we we have to um there have to be the the the the firm colours our own uh colours has to be in it  
yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh  
so it's quite convenient for user to use it  
uh it's even easier to maybe  
on on this scale the l. c. d. remote control  
mm  
yeah but you don't have <unk> have to use the button on the right  
that's  
mm  
would that work  
yeah that's me  
yeah  
yeah <unk> we went to the costa <unk> there with the bus  
this is something you have just for evaluation  
just to sort of show you  
<unk>  
yeah we have four  
do you think so  
mm-hmm  
alright you want take it back  
okay okay  
yeah  
so i'm computing that hilbert envelope which is just the envelope of some temporal trajectory  
no  
and then and then for this document you automatically assign to it the label of the document uh one  
but you're telling even <unk> also shifting no  
that were my findings  
mm  
oh <unk> <unk> oh yeah you mean the java framework uh what uh mike presented  
but then it must be some window there you know  
okay  
it can be curved because that yeah it's a little bit more trendy to be curved  
turning g. d. f. and what other bits into n. x. t.  
yeah  
mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the <unk> also my task yeah  
<unk> red  
twelve hundred  
but anyway we only we only gonna present this once and we can probably just like sort of start it up before the presentation starts  
yeah it just takes a second uh  
like north south east west  
and uh and then <unk> <unk> go through some of the way that i've dealt with that information  
or do we uh uh go further as matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices  
or no this is ten indeed okay  
i think technologically i'll give it an  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
we've we've done well  
and then you just yeah  
and with a just a few buttons  
mm-hmm  
something to shoot at your television  
yeah  
mm-hmm yeah  
yeah but if if you stick to um  
yeah well that wa it's just thirty minutes ago so it's not quite uh but well i have to do it  
ah  
um this is a prototype  
i have to knock that one down a couple notches  
personally i i have no problem with this  
yeah  
which is probably the most complicated thing like the person goes away then comes back ten minutes later sits at a different place  
and u. i. d. the technical fun functions design  
<unk>  
yes yes  
i mean you you <unk> you could be able to do some sort of code missing data sort of bayes stuff yeah  
i could recover it back from there actually but  
'cause everyone can whistle or clap and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology  
yeah but i uh actually don't need this presentation i guess  
okay as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting this one are uh are done  
it's <unk> bi little bit too big to write  
and you have not added one item there  
yeah good luck  
no  
oh right okay you've got more okay  
well i think it's it's uh a lower number so better because <unk> we designed it for young people especially didn't we  
yeah  
yeah click on it  
so yep  
we're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it and you're gonna need the switch  
but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion  
i oh  
okay  
three  
did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this  
um specifically the <unk> over there  
so exactly  
yeah mm-hmm  
the ball could sit on a  
so um when you're watching t. v. uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall  
m. f. c. c. or triangles  
yeah  
and this can be used by the adult or by the children  
yeah  
yep  
red  
sorry  
uh  
mm  
oh  
right  
so that's  
it  
we could have used it more efficiently we just didn't think of it that way  
i see  
obviously we'll hide that in the presentation  
alright  
yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then  
yeah  
yeah we're doing now  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
well we will discuss that after maybe  
and just provide like something where each of them just if if there's uh a jasmine script and a vera script and they each can load their stuff and see their data in in the thing  
that's very  
no  
yeah  
and you just cut off  
yeah  
more loud clicks in the microphone  
'kay  
mm  
you know in the darkness it's very easy so right  
sorry i skipped this sheet  
yeah  
um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or  
okay  
you guys were still in kindergarten right  
these pens are are neat though  
as you can see here  
quite disposable  
so uh yeah so with the motion basically the motion tried to estimate well the motion between two frames  
so you get so so it knows whether you're looking at a part or whether you're looking at target area or what or whatever  
yeah  
it's not an apple  
or too small  
yeah maybe should go and draw an animal  
okay  
so  
say get back with the title by the seventh  
that they talk about something different in each different topic segment  
okay  
oh okay  
yeah  
okay  
but this was did you say it th wasn't picked up in ami or you i i i was confused about <unk>  
that's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market  
no  
it would be bet more like a lemon  
um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control  
but it but we know it's there  
first we have a look at  
fun  
the remote yeah  
whereas in reality as we've gone through this it's not really the centre point of creativity it's more just a  
no old menu uh there is no menu in the d. v. d.  
right  
just for t. v. remote control  
okay next  
and chips  
yeah  
okay  
yeah i'm not sure about  
that would be kinda neat  
i mean it's impossible  
everybody uh has something uh to say about it  
uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty  
<unk>  
okay  
remember i'm an old man  
you think it would work okay  
because we got  
the i. s. m. isn't a source type  
what uh what do you think  
yeah  
i hear what the marketing expert's saying about um voice activated control  
but yeah i'm trying to streamline mine a little bit  
yeah  
yeah it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page  
the so the simplex basically if you've got a say you've got two topics  
she transcribed from the lapel mic  
yeah there i are numbers in the um the w. tag but there are no time stamps  
okay  
yeah  
and we  
right  
they're purposely not counters  
yeah  
yeah the full uh  
yeah you're still detecting a line even if you're detecting it from broad band filters  
hmm  
it's not very um  
um one that one that i think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source  
okay  
or so something uh physical  
it's single curved  
okay so um this report is about uh trend watching  
right  
and the management expert of uh the marketing expert  
uh let's see  
okay  
so i have the general feel  
just dual screen  
oh okay  
preview what's on the channel  
yeah maybe another problem uh  
mm  
separate more separate <unk> yeah  
was it  
uh not only just uh the shape but also our company  
so that's the l. c. d. screen is perfect i think and not uh  
yeah what did you use to make that file  
f. eight  
or kids  
our colour is more yellow and the it should be easy to take in a hand  
um diodes transistors <unk> resistors and <unk> capacitors all need to be considered as well  
cool  
uh yeah i think so  
any takes on this  
general questions  
well that's possible of course  
mm-hmm  
when you don't have that separate button and you push <unk> one it's exactly the same thing  
yeah  
or just delete or back up it  
okay  
well  
yeah i appreciate this idea because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables the people's choices  
this isn't helpful  
intermediate is a region  
the basic one yep  
no  
that  
use big clear buttons  
yes  
so we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things  
yeah on  
yeah sleeping  
well this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful  
everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber very simple and easy to use yeah  
yeah that's better  
we'll have volume  
cobra  
so if you  
yeah  
um  
see you  
you would point to it  
yes  
um hence our motto we put the fashion in electronics  
and if the frequency doesn't change over the wa over over the lengths of the uh  
might we might wanna be a bit more <unk> <unk> about  
you have to but you can take a p. d. f. and convert p. d. f. to ascii  
um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well because um sort of young people are  
in the market  
okay  
yep  
oh you have to hit like function and f. something  
but if there's enough light then it's using the light so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time  
so i would say that's the end of that meeting  
we we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five euros and make i make profit  
um okay  
think that would be fine  
yeah i don't know if we've marked things like silicone one  
uh um  
okay  
it's um based on a mango  
i'll add it later i guess the presentation  
yeah  
fourteen twenty six  
let's fill i fill in the buttons later  
is the ability to you know to control things other than the t. v. and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room  
so on to  
mm  
unless they develop a convention  
i'm louisa  
thanks  
um one of them is our <unk>  
no  
and then there's a bunch of other things that get added that you might still want to be in um augmented g. d. f. format  
i think we could design into that  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and these two buttons are or not necessary or  
uh they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium  
i don't read lips  
mm  
yeah but you don't <unk> uh you don't understand my point  
<unk> great  
yeah  
but an l. c. d. screen  
again that's just quite boring shape grey looks quite space <unk> but too many buttons i think on that one  
mm-hmm  
but it says it's a coding like this right where you say it's in state a. state b. state c. state a.  
our b. s. c. uh w. uh  
yeah  
yes definitely yeah  
um on the agenda for this um for this particular meeting we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting  
and then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user  
so now we seem to have a consensus that l. c. d. <unk> are definitely the way to go because of style and  
<unk> so i think  
yeah that's right  
but i mean even even that is like this big  
so th an a. s. r. decoder we can have things in  
i think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer  
well yeah what you do is you're taking this and <unk> over it the probability of the topic given the document  
now let's first go through the list with the materials  
mm  
true is a one  
nice  
i dunno i'm  
okay  
and too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals  
yes  
and i hope you all had a good individual working time  
right  
so it's only uh once double curved  
i if you just <unk> uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary  
uh-huh  
uh one is a flat one and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved  
i plan to do that as well  
right okay so so that gives us a more trendy look as well  
good good  
i'd say so  
yeah you yeah you have one one button from <unk> set frequency <unk> or something and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh  
hmm  
so i could probably get that  
and and you know of course there are gonna be <unk> many situations where you like the first transcriber can't make any sense of it  
and to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of play doh we used every bit  
oh alright  
that's on the rub rubber part  
so i think they did this in uh in charlotte's web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh  
and detachable big buttons for all people um  
yeah  
'kay  
yeah  
sort of a sphere where maybe you  
so i think it's four  
how do you uh uh give input to the menu on the l. c. d. screen  
how can we build on that  
four  
that's uh my uh favourite animal  
uh i didn't no no  
which that's even  
we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d. v. d. player  
yeah  
that that would be a named entity which is very highly <unk> um frequented in that part  
the colour  
'kay  
yeah  
and we will we will serve the charger with this  
um okay my from my role i don't think that personal preferences but role preferences i think um something comfortable to hold  
so i guess just for the sake of using the white board and killing a little more time i'll just write down the things that are most common to be checked  
so you can uh it was not so just i mean because the motion i mean it was uh in the shot we've seen  
yep  
okay  
okay so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control  
okay  
no it's uh thirteen minutes  
yeah  
so the remote control should be only used for the the television  
okay thank you  
we've already kind of covered this as well  
right  
and then well this is on off button  
yeah  
theta two is so these guys all have to add up to one yeah  
'cause we need certain information out of this analysis  
i think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television yeah  
it sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it  
yeah mm-hmm  
yeah th th it's it's uh  
okay  
yeah yeah  
um personal preferences that i was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through fashion and simplicity  
so that it can play uh smoothly and but we are still uh investigating for the video formats  
so you can turn to change the channel  
you <unk>  
mm four  
yeah  
<unk> but that's great and and and what i was what what i was saying the catchy colours  
um basically i was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields  
great  
so we're <unk> supposed to be rubber  
doesn't appear on the screen here  
alternatively there's always the method of just giving it a really high score  
and then yeah the buttons  
they're already blink corrected  
um oh i i got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base  
so we have four four <unk> and five  
does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe  
what did you say your title was again  
okay so no joystick  
it's ready to get started  
because otherwise we're just going to i mean even if it's necessary or not  
roll 'em up or roll 'em down  
no  
uh  
yeah  
okay  
with with some <unk> with some layers in it  
well it might be more sensible to assign it an average value  
so we can do uh a <unk> a little uh nice things with it and um they use yeah  
hmm  
okay okay  
yeah  
it's just for user <unk> for kids or old people  
yeah  
yeah  
or six uh  
okay  
and the uh industrial design it is how the object will look like  
no  
we sure about the advanced chip we need for the display  
thanks don't be sarcastic  
that's great  
um  
they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important  
no  
except the entire screen  
no it's it i i'll go for two  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really ti  
no  
that comes with the l. c. d.  
i dunno if fancy is the word i would use  
and have a special events trigger if  
um so i didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet  
well the problem is that all of these things are popping out of existence  
and it's spongy as well  
this is about uh what we are going to uh do uh  
uh well if the um  
yeah i think it's a really good idea  
in a remote control  
he's the the inventor of that implant and for for the ear i think  
dude you're a good drawer  
oh actually i know what i can do  
yeah some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about  
or how do we <unk> discourse structure right above utterances instead of uh those high level intentional structure of discourse  
well the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated  
yeah 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well  
do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though  
and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales so we should take it into consideration also  
yeah  
yeah  
that was my presentation  
yeah  
yeah  
it will be much <unk> much expensive th though it's the most natural thing but  
and also you see the indicator in where we are is jumping  
not the dark colours  
nah nah nah  
mm-hmm  
and then at the end of the dialogue it dawned on me that he actually meant evaluation  
there is no  
oh  
we need to stay here and work out that  
hmm  
um so basically i just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world  
yeah  
two yeah  
thirty minutes  
and then um excess buttons  
yeah we i think you get it  
i mean it is this something they <unk> they were doing it at the moment but i don't know whether this was very preliminary or do you remember  
you know people who get scared by having lots of buttons and that might be older people  
<unk>  
uh but um which the ones we made on the  
surely they should they should have had that actually  
yeah  
yes um  
officially  
well  
yeah  
or they just keep those patterns or i don't know how it is exactly  
handy  
here  
in fact in in one uh remote control that i've seen instead of doing that <unk> you could just say these are the <unk> <unk> channel three  
hmm  
well i did a course about it but uh i shouldn't say it too loud because um the professor is working here at <unk>  
oh it's greek but uh okay  
okay  
alright  
if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then  
fair enough fair enough  
yes well but <unk> because when you push menu you get in and then you have to push okay when you get to a choice  
not every idea necessarily it's still a remote control  
yeah  
i'll do the minutes  
okay  
we can make it in fact  
<unk> yes but maybe in an expensive way or maybe in a stupid looking way though  
yeah it will cost little bit more  
i'm not sure  
so as it is not really doing either of them  
and yeah and then they can tune fine tune their measures  
based on this but we could change this rule rather than changing all those things  
no  
uh yeah  
<unk>  
sure  
ordered  
yeah  
because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions  
is anybody gonna parse  
that's what we're doing  
um i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting  
ah it'd fall over all the time though  
yeah  
that's right  
so what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately  
yeah  
oh no i forgot about that  
i'll try to  
so wait uh i don't get it  
it more and more appears to me that if we if we scrap the notion of the meeting as an individual thing and sort of <unk> see meetings as as topic segments and have sort of like hierarchical topic segmentation instead  
yeah  
yeah i think it's very good yeah  
production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department which is us is uh fifteen point eight euros  
okay  
okay so i'm continuing with the user interface uh topic  
i think those are totally met because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want they have the simplicity they want  
yeah it was hardly ever used really  
i um yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
speech coding  
uh sixteen to forty  
it will be i guess  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
but it  
so now what we know what we know is how to approximate that hilbert envelope  
okay now we're moving on to market  
<unk> yeah  
yes  
and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control like absolute final decision  
we cannot contact them  
yes we could have  
that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting  
okay  
mm-hmm  
whichever relations you have to build you know  
my personal preferences  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
did they  
but maybe i was just wrong about it  
so once you <unk> go over you try it one corpus  
and showing <unk> something on t. v. and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control  
oops this one  
looks like some piece of medical equipment  
ah this is not defined at all  
yeah  
so we do count as i think excellent or one  
well th yeah  
the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh  
okay  
okay yeah  
right  
tall  
the third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company  
rich iron spectrum  
it's rubber as it is yes  
yeah  
uh <unk> <unk> possibly but few people have tried to you know  
so it would be  
and uh <unk> did you want the percentage of time fixated as opposed to which is sort of another view of this number  
mm  
and  
well uh i uh  
'kay so we came up with that that's okay  
maybe that's an option  
uh no i suppose rather than being nobody's bothered so far is it  
also a kind of rubber uh  
i think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that i made where you know the buttons that people use all the time  
right  
uh record the message and record an answer and then once you uh talk to the remote then um he will a answer with the  
where uh some but some which you can buy right  
mm  
because they probably live in a household that has a t. v. if they're at the lower end of the age range i don't know  
uh it  
but we still keep the flipping mechanism  
that we decided we don't want to have  
yep  
that's okay with me i don't care  
yeah  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah yeah but yeah but you also can put it somewhere near the window in  
in the features  
it's the most import yeah  
a one as we not only kept it but we were limited by  
mm-hmm  
and i think if we wanna keep our costs down we should just go for <unk>  
it should be uh should be possible  
yeah  
one remote for everything  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh i again if we go with touch screen i don't think that's a big issue  
so what i have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the t. v.  
and uh i just uh watch what the differences are and i checked uh well what what <unk> do we want  
yep we have five minutes left  
so banana pineapple and pear  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
it  
so  
oh okay  
that's my turtle  
plastic it sucks  
soccer fronts  
i've labelled that wrong  
if if it yeah i don't i'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh but it's uh yeah it's uh original idea  
we thought about yeah uh the back is of course totally titanium  
well this not nit it read only  
and as you can see it says the same thing it had not lost itself thank goodness  
okay  
'cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them  
team work okay  
yeah digital pens  
it makes look more fruity as well  
my team wasn't very clear  
not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work  
ah okay  
and you don't want to turn on the lights to turn it down because there's suddenly an explosion and it's gonna wake up the baby  
yeah  
or uh  
you mean the remote control with a <unk> module if you want you can just use  
uh <unk> i call it teens and twenties  
save it  
i liked this <unk> but i hated that one  
so uh basically we we are not decided if <unk> we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control  
<unk> so this means that to some extent we could have a device which would not yet be fully synchronized and  
yeah i think so  
mm  
hmm  
although if it's sitting still for too long  
hmm  
because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative but it but it  
um just only plastic or only rubber  
okay  
no quite good uh  
as uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to yeah  
yeah  
i agree with uh  
yeah  
if we have any questions we'll just email you i guess  
is that alright with everybody else  
my parents had cats  
yeah  
uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control  
t. not t. v. to say but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display  
well let's  
audio is very bad right  
the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh <unk> uh for the remote control finder  
uh i can't see anything very much but yeah that's that's it  
it's not t. f. i. d. f. it's just inverse document frequency  
yeah  
uh material you use plastic  
yeah something like that  
so  
but of course flores  
smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't because of the new requirements  
um as we've heard  
and uh how important the uh users find them  
alright  
so yeah i mean like what's the point of saying hello remote i mean hello how how are you  
or too <unk>  
ah okay  
mm  
so um i have actually two questions that are uh just practical question <unk> about my um my implementation now  
right  
yeah  
because generally  
and we don't have to use it for d. v. d. players uh and all kind of stuff  
i don't know when they'll bank these by the way  
right  
yeah  
mm  
yes  
but i think that it's worth it <unk> kinetic um  
so that you know  
what do you think uh l. c. d. is a major feature or  
you should had come on it would have been okay  
because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such  
so <unk> <unk> two  
no <unk> <unk> just <unk> just a <unk>  
you <unk> no you get the <unk>  
no they <unk> yeah yeah yeah i'm sure  
so we'll go for the hand dynamo huh  
something with the shape of the palm  
it uh then then it uh there's a internal recovery if it just <unk> replace the disk there  
um etcetera  
three papers about  
yeah maybe <unk> maybe we could have a patent on this one  
there's so much available  
i don't know if there is really no um  
we need a wireless microphone  
yeah yeah  
more difficult to make  
that's right whether it's left hand or right hand but but don't you think that the two points are clashing  
and then you can  
like there's sometimes a point to loading not usually that long  
oh that's fine  
yes  
the they didn't really define in what should be used for  
that's true  
new ideas found did we find any no  
i mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones  
of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million  
because everything was written then and there itself  
i was used to use linux before so  
well alternatively we could always have sort of a third small component whatever  
in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control  
nope  
yeah draw draw it on the board  
the dogs have a tail  
we <unk> we <unk>  
here's yeah  
i spent a lot of time searching and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set  
okay  
um okay so  
i don't know  
that's yeah exactly  
because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket on uh in your jacket  
and what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition  
so i hope you can do that in thirty minutes  
are you gonna do that  
mm-hmm volume  
so it may be that they have a coding system that's ready to go and we should just apply it  
yeah  
yeah  
but how much  
be worth exploring anyway  
hmm  
i mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote but you see it in a lot of other places  
that's called segment here that do we know which file this is pulling from  
yeah okay  
okay  
okay  
i think it's very <unk> difficult  
um  
sometimes people really go through  
does that make sense <unk> that sort of strategy  
six  
yeah  
true  
and that meaning what  
like with sampling this this uh one second of the trap to something which i which i uh preserved all the points in the centre and just uh picked every tenth point at the boundaries  
maybe i've uh it's easier if i draw it in once  
i'm not sure  
yeah so  
it's it's too much  
under two hours  
so if you hold it in your hand like this you put your finger in the gap this is the <unk> most easy part  
so it wouldn't be displayed in in the uh graphical display  
i have one question  
it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think no  
mm-hmm  
okay  
i mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition  
difference  
for something that looks cool and also has what i want it to <unk> do technologically  
yeah just cross those out  
yeah right  
this is basically talking about just the the feel of it so probably not the smell of it but the bright colours  
d. i. v. a. something like that  
um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour  
very interesting  
so could be normative or not  
that's why i asked you  
uh  
just for television  
i so each  
design  
exactly  
triangle  
but you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well  
switch it on switch it off go to this channel go to channel nine turn the volume up etcetera  
'cause i'm gonna go at three  
uh and so and so if i get that right  
yeah  
like the uh like the phones and these things we <unk> yeah  
but that would make make the top round  
mm-hmm  
focusing on their desires um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly  
and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing but um  
here's what we're going to do  
okay but the the colours you you can make it uh make the colours with <unk> uh beneath the the buttons  
it's the same thing as when you just push the one  
a <unk> a little uh you can click away and then you have <unk> much more functions that most people don't use but <unk> some do do  
and so so so the so the broader bands do what on this picture  
industrial design  
the construction task is essentially the same  
uh yeah quite possibly but since it's coming from <unk> uh it's coming from <unk> in switzerland  
like do they look like they're utterances numbers  
us user define  
i'd say two  
we just did our project evaluation  
okay so that's good  
well h. l. was a line there really isn't it  
and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition  
well it's got a strong look this  
yeah if if you're honest we'll uh type one special colour  
or the um the addendum the thing which is next going to be added  
a simple chip which is the least expensive but i have no numbers to give you a regular chip  
everyone sort of keeps their own hours  
alright the next um decision is chip on print  
mm-hmm  
why  
do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting  
if it is fancy or not  
because having just one spare place this was probably the strongest disagreement in my group  
okay should we chan okay this two channel  
so well this uh should be it  
so these two kind of uh inform mm two kinds of the information uh might be some kind of a difference  
they will see one of each as grey  
<unk>  
i don't know  
i so i i thought that okay i one stream will be p. l. p. and the other will be delta p. l. p. <unk>  
mm yeah  
because you can certainly mix things  
for example if you have <unk> <unk> four buttons channel up and down uh volume left right okay i've i think we have to keep that  
mm yeah  
yeah  
uh well what what will be our market  
oh you have no models at all  
'kay  
uh no i think it's more of the feel  
sorry  
mm  
uh-huh  
yeah the <unk> when you press the alarm system the lights behind the and it'll <unk>  
um there are a few changes we've made  
'kay  
and twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for r. s. i.  
so who will be the the responsible for the functional design  
for matthew yep  
but but maybe you you could have some some other <unk> li or the task like if if you imagine you have some <unk> on of of the web pages like like like for example you you look at at at at at a set of pages  
yeah  
yes  
i don't know  
oh is that true  
uh oh yeah are th  
nice  
okay  
mm  
mango  
i know but do you touch this or do you touch this  
temporarily anyway  
yeah i think it's about five  
clearly labelled and it acts like the previous one you just plug in and it works  
yeah  
um what is the purpose of the light  
okay  
just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote that'll  
sure  
maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working  
hey you  
yeah just at at the top  
<unk>  
um so good that's that that's excellent  
so  
i'll think of that every time now  
but we have  
yeah  
oh good point  
yes  
um i guess you two have to figure that out  
uh  
yeah  
but it's still this is a process from neutral hydrogen  
yeah  
'cause the i find that the problem with <unk> often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there yep  
so that was mainly that the statistics we said  
hmm  
an original remote control of any t. v. kind uh a phillips remote control <unk> you pay uh  
but that's about all  
is that a single curved rather than a double curved  
yeah or the room for it was the idea to be creative so  
okay  
i with the television yeah  
yeah  
um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different  
yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that couldn't you  
so it should this question should be hard to lose  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
so that it easy and fast  
yeah i mean you wouldn't you wouldn't include <unk> or line strengths  
it <unk> <unk> is is this large  
being <unk>  
four  
no i  
yeah i think it's it's good yeah  
<unk> we have scroll wheel as well  
yeah  
shapes or what do we need  
all kinds of things  
so uh well i lost all the <unk> i was i uh i used as input uh for my system  
so they decided to put speed restrictions on  
that's squishy  
sample sensor sample speaker  
the u. u. s. u. uh u. s. b. cord doesn't work  
yeah  
i would i would have hoped so anyway  
so i it's just going to add <unk> to the cost  
here let me  
simplicity and fashion  
what do you  
alright  
so how did you like lisbon then  
um yeah maybe it's  
that <unk> that wasn't very smart i guess  
mm-hmm  
so cake  
okay  
mm-hmm  
oh i better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs  
yeah li like like this like this  
yeah  
i uh <unk> <unk> that's what i mean  
but that's our secondary audience  
if it's weighted maybe  
mm-hmm  
that's right  
so  
so um i sent you the agenda it was on the in the project documents  
and we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary i have a final report to present um and then we're done  
so you'll have to get all the sound files from the m. m. m. server and the person's transcription file should be in that folder where you're putting yours  
yeah  
if it's not a double curved then we've got the choice for the push buttons if it's a double curve we've gotta go for rubber push buttons  
do we want something crazy  
at least that's what i'm accustomed to  
do you want to yeah  
are they all included like <unk> or <unk> are these different options  
but it's not there's a difference between um saying that something is in a particular state every frame  
oh where's the volume button in the dark and uh <unk> you just touch it or you just pick it up and it lights up or something  
seven step kinda evaluation process  
yeah yeah it's very spongy  
right  
yeah  
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago flashlights  
so for that part uh for that kind of back channels we can just skip that and uh uh to not treat them as interruptions or something like  
ah there we go  
line in it  
yeah i think four maybe would be appropriate because it's  
hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an l. c. d. or a touch screen um  
mm-hmm  
that would uh  
yes  
so  
no no  
the problem is after all this meeting there is  
and how does it get uh charged up  
yeah but uh i think that becomes too difficult it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then  
speech recognition  
yeah  
and plus these two <unk> uh plus the mute button and it's will be uh eighteen  
mm  
what would be  
and if you have both you can um well you can compare this to to one stored and so get out uh which person it is  
it's that simple because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh  
okay  
yeah  
what's different  
okay now we're gonna look at finances  
okay  
it's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived for example heard or felt maybe or by the human user  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the <unk> rubber could be quite  
i know  
and so <unk> i i think this <unk> it already <unk> resembles uh something like a pear to me or something  
water proof as well  
i think it should probably just be continuum  
yeah yeah yeah the temporal <unk>  
but efficient though  
<unk>  
i'll see you later  
it could be one of the options  
well they think it's very true but uh  
that's good  
well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know  
yeah but we decided to have something yellow and red for the costs  
yeah  
um  
do that in my spare time so that's basically an  
oh  
here  
um  
yeah  
and then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes  
that's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss yeah  
yeah  
is it  
warning finish meeting now  
nothing  
what are you going to do  
they always say uh well look at the clustering there's here we've got some documents that all appear to be about the same thing  
okay  
yeah  
no in no not only speech yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
zero to nine  
yeah  
yeah the top  
uh i mean it it it won't because of the fixation it will be down to what we define as uh a gaze  
mm-hmm  
no i wasn't no sorry i wasn't thinking of the screen of like a p. d. a. but  
and then we get this information about people talking not talking and to say okay uh  
especially in in big dispersed groups but this is kind of a smaller group  
mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk  
but uh they want to make also the slide acquisition  
because if we're doing like i think for for the information density we uh we should calculate it on the lowest level not on the highest  
well when you stop <unk> the wheel it stops  
um  
this  
of course  
yeah  
five  
it's probably not sending  
it's like nineteen eighties  
mm-hmm  
doesn't matter yeah  
well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l. c. d. and the way you operate it than the form and the colour but it definitely is  
yeah it's the one it's <unk> maybe we ha we have two versions the first version the basic version  
because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work  
oh  
where the hell he here i guess and yeah when you have to uh use something else  
yeah  
okay  
it's a feature of the whole spectrum rather than you can't say there is a rich iron spectrum you can say this is a rich iron spectrum  
like that  
you know there are some colours that i <unk> i would never choose and i would be curious how many people choose that colour  
so something like this  
try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received  
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l. c. d. or not because it's too expensive  
well right  
no not everyone can whistle can they though  
normally we'd go for fruity colours but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man for an example customer  
it hasn't  
okay but it's quite universal you know  
yeah then they're clicking a lot yeah  
yep  
<unk> but it what you're producing at the moment is like individual text files that sort of have the raw text for a whole a meeting as a whole or  
oh yeah  
yes  
so  
yeah  
the what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two  
no no signal control pan  
okay  
okay  
okay  
well it's about the same because if  
uh  
no i i gave yeah  
can i see  
what about um making this rubber  
so  
sorry  
maybe we can bring <unk> uh uh teletext to the <unk> to the remote control  
yeah  
okay  
so i in fact the the <unk> something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use  
project  
i <unk> is th <unk> the the yellow ball thing that  
mm yellow  
there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there  
cool  
it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good  
yes  
um but for the purposes of this meeting i'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures  
easy to use  
for noise reduction purposes we've moved everyone who has office hours together and we've also put the network printer and the photocopier in the hall  
it would be a great idea but is it possible technically  
yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it and see if it works  
hmm  
oh i get to do it too  
just keep you just make new covers for the for it like we agreed before  
because i don't know how to do better if i don't evaluate anything  
so this is what i found we can use  
that kind of thing  
okay  
but is it just infra red  
you know what i mean  
because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results so  
but if you don't sell  
and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape  
so special colours two  
excellent  
mm  
so we what we can use is plastic rubber wood and titanium  
<unk>  
i <unk> i can i can see where that's useful  
yeah  
we could have <unk> even lost the selection button and uh done everything via l. c. d. selection  
is there  
maybe  
and um basically there it's connected to three things  
uh  
i'll send you guys the link for that correlated topic model stuff if you want but uh i don't know if it's too interesting to you  
i know imagine we went the first ten <unk> fifteen years of our lives without the internet  
well  
yeah with hamed uh <unk> and these people  
i think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so  
all the other fancy interface designs go out the window i'm afraid  
yeah  
one question uh how late do we have to get back be back here  
so  
yeah yeah  
yeah um  
oh the line width is too thick but oh well  
no  
you have to hope that there's language and one of them says something  
yeah  
yeah <unk> differently it's mainly the differences different approaches of engineers versus linguists or <unk> and yeah mm  
that's what it says  
okay  
no not true  
okay  
so  
okay  
okay yeah okay  
okay  
uh so you  
mm-hmm  
so the gamma are somehow estimated or computed on top of <unk>  
yeah it's only actually the size of my hand  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
ah  
yeah i um i think so too i mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons  
um  
yeah  
people give some database and then you have to dis you can use whatever you want and you have to produce even for features also like features also i think  
yeah  
the they they are <unk> doing only  
rubber casing i thing would probably the best if we're going for the anti r. s. i. and like more choice with um aesthetics  
yeah  
<unk> can you hand me over this uh  
and you move up <unk> forward down left  
oh yeah  
um  
oops  
yeah  
uh i figured this is a pretty <unk> good impression of a rabbit  
so which did you <unk> uh did  
<unk> it  
yes  
so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough <unk> kinetic energy use the kinetic energy and otherwise use the batteries  
alright  
oh  
uh that i can't answer directly  
uh-huh  
and then two numbers so that's just uh it's annoying  
so <unk> <unk> <unk> you don't have subjects lined up but you don't expect any trouble getting them  
when you press a key um you complete a specific connection  
uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting  
yeah  
so the scroll wheel  
did they <unk> do we have to use an advanced chip for the l. c. d.  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
uh votes let's vote  
i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control if they have the money you know so  
can we leave this up to you  
we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user friendly  
okay alright  
p. l. p. should be there  
numbers  
okay so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range um what about  
it's also a it's both the <unk>  
okay  
project documents yeah  
mm-hmm  
and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert  
mm  
well then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important  
ye  
it's real yeah  
voice control have seven  
mm-hmm  
round  
you don't care about the frame dropping i mean because anyway in each in the video signal it is encoded the time right  
so what are th what are the characteristics of the interactive areas  
okay we just lost one strawberry  
the television lights  
we all know where we're going to  
so  
okay  
okay  
but since the <unk> the definitions of look a thing we're looking at are <unk> um are the ones which get rid of the lower level  
no  
discuss sure  
yeah yeah  
yeah i imagine some sort of vinyl thing  
yeah sure  
first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications  
<unk>  
and also different things  
oh no it isn't  
yeah  
i uh think it might  
evaluation <unk> okay  
okay  
uh okay slash  
yeah  
and then i say i don't remember  
so let's say an average size okay and it should not be very heavy also  
the working design  
why not  
that's probably something so i i mean all these are constraints  
um and then as i say uh <unk> we'd like to <unk> our design features from this and um  
okay  
oh yeah it's going  
died  
design  
yeah you can make 'em another one  
uh the agenda  
yeah  
yeah that should be uh anything matters  
uh-huh  
so um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user  
yes  
it look like this one  
so let's leave it there  
yeah  
so maybe we should go with something different or be able to i was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called  
room for creativity  
okay  
uh train it okay  
no one's explicitly said that they needed to avoid anyone else  
i don't know i don't go shopping for remote controls that often maybe somebody's already though of it  
you know  
do we need to say how many buttons or  
so i that's the other thing it's like  
you have that's good  
but how do you wanna solve it  
i go  
uh this this was a most spongy option  
yeah  
like just a weighted average is probably the most sensible way to about it and possibly <unk> it  
hmm  
so i i hear she would quite clearly there and i think a good number of them you'll be able to resolve just just helps to have the context and be able to listen to it again  
i it you may not require that but you know um it's it's it's something very natural i guess  
okay okay  
close the the window  
during the design uh design life cycle we uh  
and but anyway do you know exactly how it is done when you really have those m. f. c. c. coefficients  
hmm  
<unk> yeah  
sixteen euros sorry  
uh the <unk> the next phase will be um  
those buttons you can you can  
let's move on  
right right  
and the the only false one is because we've chosen  
like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes  
yeah  
if you handle a remote you you usually don't have your hand straight like this  
the <unk> science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve  
but can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be that would be a really main cost source then right  
hmm  
they're a special colour  
that gives you an whole new uh <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah but can you also say i want <unk> uh veronica on the channel number uh five or  
is that everything  
okay  
<unk> easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to  
well a coffee grind doesn't have <unk> <unk>  
okay so the um uh this <unk> industrial designer should produce a working design  
yeah  
you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it  
we have some spongy yeah  
uh my page is blank still  
get your own information  
that's a really good idea  
the size  
no  
it's um you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever  
doesn't it  
thing  
they're  
from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had the design logo was one which we've already mentioned  
also if you're sixty years old  
yeah  
like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something  
but uh that's when i'm hoping  
no  
so that's the end of it  
yeah  
so we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and i'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey  
maybe okay we can uh see a little bit if you want to play the  
but uh <unk> you know  
uh they do  
yeah  
and the l. c. d. makes it better  
you've got your name  
my matthew  
basically for the circuit board which is the middle it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote  
so on one input they put um a conversion box a converter which converts from slide  
where's where's the button for two  
okay  
yep mm-hmm  
so it wasn't anything to do with rotation  
no it's okay you uh cut the l. c. d. screen and introduce two more buttons  
those are those are regions globs <unk>  
the greatest overlap with what  
were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic  
it shouldn't be uh very uh visible  
uh about this  
we should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard  
perfect  
on the left a scroll button and on the right a scroll button  
when you uh shake it a few times it it's loaded  
yeah but if you shape it  
hmm  
how can you go directly to twenty for example  
yeah  
and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside  
twice that about thirty one  
and then she had relation names and handles  
oh  
yeah no you can carry on i just  
we can uh do a touch pad on our remote  
<unk> scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it we'll just then we'll do it in black  
fruity  
mm  
yeah  
has anyone ever experimented with sort of displaying two dimensional information in in colour  
yeah that's it 'cause the <unk> are loose and each time you get up it's <unk> a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or  
but this would be really kind of i think a lot of learning for the user and and i mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly  
and but barbara still says somebody's done this for chunks  
here  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
repetitive strain injury  
okay  
alright  
'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable  
this one  
go on  
yeah  
um that was actually in use  
could you post some other essentials of what people want so that i can work with some buttons where to put it  
you mean to like  
yeah  
we have to make it grey or <unk> or black  
i hear the well there  
mm  
thank you tim  
powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons <unk> but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful <unk>  
okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it  
mm-hmm  
uh just twos  
right i don't know  
course  
okay  
so i can also say  
yeah  
but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward  
yeah  
okay  
yeah but it's a major loss no doubt  
okay so it it had to be um  
so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria as a result of doing that  
oh excellent yeah  
okay great  
just a normal battery then yeah  
mm i dunno  
we have to aim at a mu at the main audience  
i don't think we should bother 'cause we'll run it on a sound card version  
so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb also reach the middle  
i i don't know  
right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start  
not that line but we want enhanced  
hard but  
okay um control high tech innovation  
so now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control  
so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go  
can you use a bigger font  
anyway  
so then you can move your like this  
okay okay  
um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all  
mm-hmm  
you never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries  
oh yeah  
when people just uh if they can log on to it can book it  
we are trying to encode some carrier which is much easier i would say because you can really <unk> you can see that even  
yeah  
<unk>  
okay  
as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you  
well  
let's see the market demand  
i'm just go i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then <unk> this would i guess converged to the user interface designer <unk> and then industrial designer  
yeah  
uh what's your experience with remote controls um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control  
right  
one one or uh bit longer  
yep  
yes  
you know say speech recognition is good for this speech recognition is not good for this  
we just say that this are some content  
so let's see if i can get um here  
something like that  
it's a bit off  
so <unk> <unk> quite takes quite a strong position on um this um difference between these two um kinds of group activities because he says that they admit different kinds of analyses  
so so do note the grade we have five six for me five  
okay but now you have <unk> you have both cache  
uh yep  
um  
so i would probably just concatenate all my um text chunks and then let's say <unk> i will run over it  
yeah  
yes well uh  
guess  
i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need  
yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah  
um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes shoes and furniture  
okay  
um is it i don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there  
so hand dynamo  
delete and collapse  
uh teletext becomes outdated  
that everyone's um  
right  
yeah  
how do i get it  
so next one  
but we're counting star bursts as star burst galaxies  
well welcome to the kick off meeting  
okay thank you  
perfect  
but it's yeah a a rubber uh  
okay  
because you have like i mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them  
so th  
yeah  
okay  
that sounds good  
two or three  
the  
yeah  
cost  
i mean th the <unk> is is not a problem  
'cause it's slightly <unk> you know if his scripts don't work then you don't get the overlap  
oh and this is because we don't want it to stay triangle one when you start with a construct it's not a construct at all  
okay  
yes we have not many buttons  
they should be easy to press very comfortable  
oh <unk> i don't have an information on that  
and maybe fun  
how would that work  
okay  
do we need a power button at all  
yeah  
so i think that should still be okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so do you think that's more of a three then  
yeah  
the gaze will wobble  
<unk>  
uh the volume and channel <unk> uh left and right up and down arrows to uh do the volume and channel  
yeah this is yeah i understand  
i think this is a brilliant product  
and then sort of even <unk> than that we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote  
so if we have to stick with current technologies and uh  
mm-hmm  
and ha ha you cannot use my remote control because it's targeted to me  
so for example uh  
if i don't think i can get it up on the screen  
you're fired  
it i th it's fine  
did you try both shift buttons  
those kind of yeah those kind of things  
like an s. shape  
okay  
yeah oh man  
yep  
if they want like uh so that we can yeah  
yeah i'll start  
yeah okay yeah we need a connection that's true  
um  
and that all interfaces are different  
or no  
of increasing the unit price  
original <unk> and user friendly well we al also already talked about user friendliness  
shall we  
well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed you know once you turn off the power  
no more pizza for me  
um yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah everything that's a word has a <unk> time stamp  
i tick it so um i finish that page and i go back to this i can just write and then not tick until i finish writing again  
it's it's not yeah it  
and not only that  
uh yeah  
it looks like well you know uh you <unk> the shapes it's very primary colours uh bright colours and uh round shapes  
okay  
alarm but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself  
huh  
yeah i think so too  
which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design  
mm  
so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market  
yeah but  
um they tend to be very dark colours so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them  
uh with the format menu  
mm yeah  
integrated scroll wheel or push button  
the idea of this technology is that you don't think about it it just happens  
so i'll i'll have a look at that and see how we can handle that here  
yeah  
but would a backup really be necessary  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
i don't know  
uh yeah  
uh this is a first concept of our controller  
okay  
well maybe i um but it it can be quite simple you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it  
yeah  
i'm not sure if it if it has no function why even put it there  
if it was broad absorption line quasar we'd mark it  
i can't draw with this thing but i'll try  
'kay  
okay  
right  
yeah  
yeah that's a great idea  
uh-huh  
is it sufficient for two speakers  
now i will just move  
um i guess we're keeping <unk> it simple  
i <unk> that out of sequence  
but i know who to ask  
okay  
yeah  
oh i don't even know which one i've missed  
okay  
yeah  
is that right  
but uh we're we're needing we're certainly needing some data in the bag by the first of december i think  
so <unk> maybe i'll go back to your questions  
uh i will start  
mm-hmm  
mm  
it's more reliable it's cheaper  
for older people  
i um  
yeah  
uh so you would have to uh classify the sources as human or machine  
i dunno  
i mean in the signal you can extract the time  
we weren't able to do that  
we should celebrate  
see someone suggested to me that it's actually better to have talks on a similar topic spread out as much as possible which to me just seemed absolutely crazy  
yeah  
this is good also for  
mm-hmm  
no uh <unk> uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that because it makes more complex and expensive  
um  
and uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them  
mm  
well i mean what you know  
okay  
no the the score <unk> uh is fine  
yeah  
so we say true  
yeah  
the names would suggest that this was the idea right  
yeah  
yeah you can point to where you want the line to be  
uh before  
oh family guy  
yeah the favourite <unk> characteristic is that the long neck it can reach everything  
yeah  
um it's probably just i dunno if it's worth getting into  
sure  
yeah  
really  
mm-hmm  
beautiful  
'cause we can't show it in the display  
'kay there you go  
let me we've got forty minutes  
mm  
rather than trying to do all at once  
oh so i will speak about working design  
oh right the  
do we each remain wired up  
information  
hmm  
hmm  
having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well  
yeah sure but i mean for all those measures that are based on words um i can automatically just throw those where it's nothing  
what is a double curved shape  
now i have my screen back too  
okay  
okay  
for instance if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours  
i'm going to draw a cat  
so that's a shame because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years  
this is it  
so just  
or or like mobile <unk>  
and we can increase this the strength <unk> you can buy one with  
so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat single curved or double curved  
there's only one difference here  
oh yeah  
okay  
i'm sure management would like that  
yeah okay  
so we we <unk> only have one for battery  
although what what uh suddenly came into my head is you know how they always take two a. a. batteries which which is really not very efficient at all  
oh yeah  
mm-hmm  
but i don't know about uh i dunno how ergonomic a an orange is  
and we can't deliver that in <unk> with uh regards to the functions because we aren't gonna put  
so <unk> <unk>  
yeah  
but they're still no  
mm-hmm  
so uh so we we might <unk> first try a few meetings and uh have a reliability study  
<unk> i uh i had a choice between uh a few different uh sources  
well my name is iain uh  
fifteen  
like the ocean like swimming  
mm mm-hmm mm  
mm  
you did seem to include just in more detail what i've got though  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but we had  
no problem  
mm-hmm  
you're right  
with a huge variety of uh  
but there's not a lot of yellow there's not a lotta yellow  
yeah  
i switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor  
yeah it does have yeah  
okay so um i mean the the r. s. i. thing would be that  
well there is no structure  
uh material yeah that's what i have to say about material  
um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a  
joystick for user manipulation um and ergonomics of the remote control as well  
oh right  
um most people use only a <unk> a very slim portion of all the controls  
yeah  
no isn't  
i mean that's really a thing we might do  
yeah  
well <unk> you <unk> you see the <unk> uh thing is when you buy a remote you you set the uh channels  
yeah sure yeah  
is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen  
how much someone speak but when we will go to final uh details  
make the status about the shot detection  
yep  
oh i guess it was rubber rather than latex  
although i don't know  
yeah christmas two seven  
go rubber  
like  
okay  
you mean like  
i've put my files in the shared folder as well  
exactly  
mm  
here  
and then uh in three d. effect you could go  
i mean like i said before  
really  
ooh  
a a a white board  
yep  
like you can have two curves  
but if if you place the the microphones uh <unk> yeah  
yeah  
well  
so whatever material we use it should be yeah  
mm  
control  
like if it was sort of like a clip on plastic plate  
thank you j.  
um  
it <unk> it doesn't have to be there  
so divided by nine  
so you're more likely to <unk>  
uh  
yeah but why is after i mean if there is a shot you don't know between because you dropped one frame  
is it from twenty to forty  
what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost  
this is just the stuff  
we are two uh v. s. two  
mm  
you have altered the um task programme because uh to put the um little eye icon and the mouse uh to make it  
yeah  
and other  
but would we  
maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good even though and hand held the same time  
yeah if the costs al allow it  
okay  
bit of a stress ball feel  
yellow <unk>  
r. th r. to the third power  
that's at the end  
if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream  
so i've <unk> i <unk> i think it's it's it's a one  
yeah the fourteen yeah  
no  
yeah that's true  
computer is uh not functioning  
yeah  
okay then  
yeah you think  
mm-hmm  
well it it's stylish but we can yeah but you can change your covers anyway  
maybe if uh okay  
but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom then that eliminates our ball anyways  
i mean any any audio captured during that period is i is rubbish  
'cause that's the way it's dis defined  
okay  
well is it gonna be yellow  
yeah it's it's quite unique  
where it was connected to the remote control functions  
so uh a little corner of titanium  
and the  
about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel and not so much to the functionality of it  
he was <unk> somebody was asking him you were or so <unk> or somebody was asking him something  
he's french um somewhere now in teleconference like mm i don't know where he's working but th we were using it for uh speech coding  
thinking about how to set up test groups and things  
you can just draw whatever you want  
'kay  
four  
details details  
new product requirements  
yes  
yeah  
is the device easy to use  
that has to be power not energy definitely no  
then if one um segment uh <unk> one topic is selected then it plays this whole topic in five minutes  
yeah  
yeah you see i want too much  
that's it  
don't know  
okay  
there is a way of calculating it um yeah well calculating it cumulatively but i can't remember it  
why  
first one is uh what happens inside the apparatus second is what is uh the apparatus made of and the third is what should it look like  
you need a play and a <unk> fast forward and a stop function  
um but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a <unk> particular kind of technology  
yeah  
<unk> good option  
like they do on uh sky digital kinda  
or uh the numbers of course  
sort of a combination  
no  
no um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you  
exactly the special colours  
ye yes  
i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything  
yeah  
you know a simple uh with a  
okay  
so i can just now tell the the locations of all the files and you can rewind  
right  
yeah mm-hmm  
you can display actual buttons on the touch screens  
would it be if it was h. beta absorption  
and then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
rubber  
well i don't know  
to make some designs it is very easy  
team work very strong i would say  
that's me  
it's only to be for a t. v. and it must include the corporate image  
<unk> yeah but  
and wasn't really satisfied by what i saw i have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on  
hmm  
uh i was a bit pissed off yesterday about that part because it was sort of just like a decision we had taken  
and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the <unk> red for the on off switching on and off the button  
yeah  
well  
um that's probably what we go at  
yeah  
yeah but i didn't get a response so we'll see  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
this one has <unk> banana yeah  
cool  
that's true  
well i bring it to my uh personal room  
roughly  
yeah  
yeah well i don't have time in uh anymore on the  
inspired by  
there goes the special co well that would make it less appealing  
it's easy to you  
just the veneer on it yeah  
let's say you are doing uh for every twenty millisecond processing one one feature vector  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh you need some dictionary for that at some point though  
i dunno hynek told told us that somebody's using that um very actively like okay  
alright  
no wait  
we could do it as we <unk> go along the production costs looking at the prototype  
design yeah  
so i can just copy those  
is it an <unk> apple which has  
it's easier it's it's it's harder to if you have already programmed it to to swap  
so then you can choose you have every decision  
isn't it bitter like that  
uh yeah  
oh yes user presses the button  
okay  
um so we've got our opening our our agenda is the opening uh acquaintance which we've kinda done  
so which curve is that <unk> that's basically that curve  
um yeah we should  
um so any of you who want to go  
it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view  
suppose we're we want to sell it in france  
right  
exactly  
yeah  
mm  
but usually there are many others which are <unk> quite small but they are quite important  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
no no no no  
alright  
simple circuit board  
so i could just um <unk> concatenate um the words instead of the durations and it should i mean  
oh <unk> pedro i just want to say quickly i i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles eh  
yeah so you should have that one on  
<unk> but we need clearer definitions of what the different things are how many different kinds of of um activities are there  
yeah  
<unk> right  
mm  
well if you hold it you can you all can hold it is it does actually feel quite ergonomic if you've got small hands  
so we can't change much of that  
in technology is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing  
so it's it's pretty pretty <unk> holding is stupid  
cool  
i take <unk> yeah take a banana  
yeah  
no rational changes or whatever 'cause it revolutionary changes yes  
yeah  
so for example you have uh presently uh keys like one two  
uh i mean th th the the two two basic buttons you know the to skip channels and to uh  
and um the first number in every line is um how much more often that is per same um same text length  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm  
interface yeah  
yeah  
and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that  
you should like make <unk> or something design it  
has this  
well i i uh  
um  
so the here are some examples  
you won't  
okay  
on off  
so that's two so that's seven yeah  
all hooked up  
but uh you can uh i i sent it about three times now  
and also the screen you cannot mould it  
okay  
okay  
how much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic  
yeah  
or will there be times when you don't record all day  
yeah  
yeah it doesn't fit  
the various electronic options are um  
so it's uh second  
and everybody is using right handed mouse  
yeah  
so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design  
yeah yeah yeah  
um so my personal preference would be the right remote  
ye  
okay  
i don't know whether that's necessary  
yeah we'd have <unk> that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well which which again would probably be a bit expensive but  
well it's speech and any and any other class of sound  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
now um we have to get down to the nitty gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five euros  
okay  
almost  
no  
so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic simple and works fine it's already a lot  
david is fifty per cent and visitor one should yeah or spare or it's fine  
i think that um this unless somebody has uh still anything incredibly important  
i don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant  
hmm  
but i mean that's quite it becomes quite <unk> intensive  
pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece  
and actually to go with that i'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons how much they're used  
so that the interface in the sense like deals with it as if it's same so that the interface doesn't really have to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meeting  
and then there could be buttons and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format  
yeah  
uh <unk> you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself  
or you can go for both  
also with rubber  
you can  
but it's has no real added value  
uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just <unk> changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels  
yeah to that  
yeah  
think it's a good place people don't  
yeah  
yeah  
but the colours  
definitely  
okay yes  
well  
doesn't have to be out taking a <unk> for a few hours a day or anything  
um  
uh no  
we discussed all the new ideas but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals  
okay well i uh  
but do you  
yeah it's a process or a source  
okay  
so the the permanent storage is just the <unk> stuff  
for for the for this <unk> uh type of market i think it's a one  
um i'm trying to think of anything i haven't said about the stuff but that uh from looking at the results i got it looked quite good  
it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone  
just like with the telephone  
'cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really  
so from the perspective the named entity recognition task  
but when you enter a new market with a remote control and  
'kay  
yes  
two <unk> two two digits oh okay  
you're right  
if if you make people brand aware they are willing to pay more  
shall we all try uh to think about a name  
yeah  
yeah  
i think  
and see  
that's just what freaks me out  
and if if that's gives you a little bit of <unk> status information  
let's go easy on it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um so i i think i think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more  
we'll see what see what  
fabulous  
but now we got something like uh more than <unk>  
um is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries  
do some of them use triple a. <unk> though  
steady  
okay unbreakable  
yeah  
there we go  
we have to uh design a new television remote control  
um so every time we we'll do some individual work get meeting talk about it uh and then go into the next phase  
no i think that's too vulnerable  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
of <unk> of course the most difficult question for the end  
mm-hmm  
good good  
okay  
alright  
could be possible  
um the solar power definitely would be but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed  
um did you do your hit  
but then we can split that signal into i don't know ten ten uh segments with the one hundred milliseconds or even less  
i had  
um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright  
uh  
mm-hmm  
i like all sorts of animals but for the moment i'm gonna draw a cat in memory of my poor cat that died recently  
yeah but it's quite important that it fits  
mm-hmm  
yep  
yeah  
but you're the expert  
or something like that but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something  
so you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options  
teamwork  
uh we need to wonder ah <unk> about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well we've got this idea  
hmm  
your remote  
yeah  
when a t. v. <unk> got one watching the match and your team's just lost  
and again martin and david are half time with the e. p. f. l. so  
because it  
okay  
hmm  
<unk> would that be agreeable  
oh yes yeah i'd forgotten about that  
yeah that would be an option  
i mean um we cannot expect much from from it  
and you don't know how to spell the name or if you heard the right name  
and the  
in fact i just agreed to make uh  
okay um should i go on or go back  
people welcome back with the second meeting  
and i think i mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this  
and so i think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea  
hmm  
if we're looking for a simplistic design if we need to decide if that is our um intention is is a simplistic design  
yeah  
okay you had the other power channel  
charging a particular premium anyway in the end so  
because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote huh the the speech control  
you know navigate to a program without the numbers then people might say that looks pretty easy  
whether whether that's considered to be sort of  
sorry hang on  
okay  
six and four  
okay  
anyway um apparently you guys you should work together on the final design both on internal and external design  
so i don't know whether you tack on any extra phase information or whatever  
it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button  
because the television needs to respond to the signal and if it doesn't know how it's exactly that's not possible  
unit price  
so that is also <unk> that also our product meets the <unk> the fashion uh trends of the market  
so maybe it we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the l. c. d. screen  
yeah  
well so it basically works uh as i uh uh <unk> wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary  
okay  
behind  
or you got the same message  
mm-hmm  
but it's gonna be the most expensive option probably and  
what's supplements  
hey  
um scoring shape overlap no problem  
um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module  
um it engages all your senses not just your sight but your sense of feel your sense of touch  
um well i don't have very much to add  
yeah  
you know cost wise how much how much money we had to <unk>  
that would be behind here  
okay no problem  
we will not use this  
well yeah i mean like  
in fact we might like to put a slogan on and um possibly the two r. <unk> to signify the company  
yeah  
three  
i think it should be at the top  
um  
um or building blocks  
yeah  
but actually the people talk about other things  
that'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote  
and we could uh do <unk> uh speaker rating if there are good speakers or bad speakers depending if they just read uh  
i think <unk> well i think when we go on to the <unk> <unk>  
as in within the team or  
oh where would we  
yeah  
yeah so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then  
like only a few people would really want a banana but what if it was kind of uh a <unk> banana  
have a better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market so next  
yeah we're definitely not in the money making department  
we need to to keep it consistent with other <unk> uh  
sorry i'm just um trying to update my minutes  
uh sorry  
yeah  
but uh i think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company  
yeah so it's all accessible  
oops  
i don't think  
um well i was thinking kind of just for the volume but what what do you guys think  
that's the the one with the yeah okay  
okay  
well the eye tracker does  
i thought it would be cool  
yeah  
it's on the bottom row  
so for the electronic part working and <unk> with button  
i guess so  
about the project itself not about the product  
right  
on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that because it's more for like a d. v. d. function which we are not gonna be using  
you say that i want i have six button  
to find yeah  
mm  
about yeah  
that's always quite helpful  
and i think that yep that's it  
yeah that was a mistake  
why would that be informative particularly  
i don't know if it makes sense but  
same sides  
gun metal gray  
are we doing okay just as o. k. not as a o. k. a. y.  
everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say  
back  
hi me raj again  
yeah but that's where your hand ball might be  
well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis  
and the next is eleven seconds and twelve frames  
oh  
or what was it  
okay  
okay  
uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled  
mm-hmm  
yes  
yeah daimler yeah  
it is rechargeable so we can stick with one instead of two  
yeah  
those are bad speakers in general  
um also numbers to uh to go to the specific channels  
yeah  
i know it's a bit <unk>  
so  
okay  
so  
then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give <unk> uh more options than one  
the speakers that take a time which is too close to that they are not good speaker because some way uh um they're talking too fast  
i'm not sure what we should still do though uh <unk> let's see what all your tasks were finished right  
and they have uh yeah that's uh very important uh for them  
the  
okay thank you  
yes  
them  
yeah  
find yours  
yeah for now if we don't know for sure whether  
yeah they are built in  
hmm  
and then we have the <unk>  
um  
yeah 'cause the  
while on the other meetings it's um it's it's it's really fluctuating and uh i it it uh it looks more like um uh <unk> uh well  
is it expensive  
all ready  
um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us  
the place more emphasis on the  
mm-hmm  
nothing i didn't even get an email like that was it  
maybe that'll be a second supplement  
uh you say you do the processing after uh afterwards  
um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls are that uh they are very easy to produce  
forty five plus or  
then i hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting  
'cause this this is the drop out test  
so uh  
you have to have a certain element of flatness i think  
easier than  
so it's i don't know  
yeah  
so  
so you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that  
combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited <unk> functions that we don't really use much  
yeah  
yeah  
well sunlight preferably  
need to unplug this  
i think you can do it on line  
uh uh  
when it gets into the holidays and we're not necessarily around in the holidays and and  
so if you want something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this  
i think  
um so maybe not the high end range but maybe middle middle up ish  
um from the finance department i have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five euros  
okay so it is a different class  
so <unk> this one has spongy but buttons  
oh  
button where do we want some buttons  
yeah  
so you can do this exercise and then come and talk to me some time next week  
it it stops it i mean it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something  
hooray  
so um yeah th this design is not um  
yes  
being as a marketing <unk> expert i will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market  
now it's technical specification by our  
different languages uh different skins and stuff like that  
uh but there may not be too many buttons  
six eight twelve sixteen  
okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product 'kay  
could we come up with new t. v. with such as this kind of t. v.  
yeah  
yeah  
but it doesn't tell you what they are no  
um  
what about a special colour  
that  
we should never complicate things too much  
yeah that's okay  
yeah okay <unk> why would you use that  
and uh for dialogues uh and monologues i think we might have to use different uh concepts to <unk> <unk> uh model the discourse structure  
yeah the display we yeah we can put a display  
no we did not  
well  
oh  
ah right that's good  
and you might want to add in the report length width and height  
i'm gonna join you at the table  
so you take all the p. of z. given d. and all of the p. of w. given <unk> given z. you you you can do anything with that  
okay um hereby is the meeting is finished  
um then there's the latex cover which is what you see as red  
and you don't see the buttons  
so i <unk> i just said spelling  
<unk> uh functions that may be uh used by <unk> the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session  
um  
yeah  
<unk> right  
yeah i saw that it was detected as a shot yeah  
okay  
but after my after my fashion thing i think you'll <unk> that rubber is more  
so  
and then  
yeah  
um no op i'm not very sure  
think we tried a lotta different things and um  
um i imagine that we could specify  
um as long as the scripts work right  
so uh the the first column is showing the uh our baseline system  
yeah sure sure sure  
yeah  
okay um so we're doing an on screen menu that we can scroll through  
it says it  
i mean should just be  
mm-hmm  
so maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and <unk> or the the buttons could be spongy uh somehow  
yeah in the beginning as well sometimes i think  
and then just drop all the other buttons  
yeah  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
evaluation  
i think they're talking there about do we want wood plastic titanium or rubber and i think we've discussed not having titanium  
we have a back and a okay button  
i think i'll give it a two 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do something is gonna happen  
with the energy dissolution or with uh f. f. t. too  
uh big one they are uh not easy to use  
i think you have nice colours  
this is what we came up with  
yeah  
so they obtain better results with that finally or  
this carrier signal what what it really looks <unk> yeah  
if you want to use teletext you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available  
and then the shop assistant comes up and says oh what colour would you like  
yeah  
i have <unk> i have two different  
i hope the students of management die but anyway  
yeah  
the prototype  
that's  
do you still have the pictures over there  
okay  
okay i dunno if you had this information already  
no it's it's just the same product that is already on the market  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
i mean it to some extent it doesn't matter which data format it's in n. x. t. or g. d. f.  
yeah it's can be saved easier  
yeah  
mush  
well that's all i had to say about the evaluation  
although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well  
yep  
okay  
mm-hmm  
ah yeah  
but um yeah  
it's just  
yeah i mean we know that  
mm-hmm  
okay i will play yeah  
which is the little black kind of line in the middle  
why why don't we replace the titanium with uh  
i thought they're thirty  
great great  
okay well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially  
well gonna give the electronic white board uh a shot  
uh we have a simple regular and advanced chip  
you  
take what you <unk> yellow remote control  
no no it's free they'll be releasing soon i guess  
yeah  
yeah but the point is that you should change in a way that to take the label into account or not  
oh  
i'm sort of like i think i'll take over the display just because i've started with a bit and found it found it doable  
let's make this thing really exclusive environmentally sensitive uh high tech design uh ergonomics all of this  
yeah of course  
can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control  
or i like you know the black finish or the silver finish or whatever  
so  
but i is it if it is <unk> huh  
yeah  
i think i would put a plus and a min uh here  
mm er can you go up behind me  
okay  
i don't think that matters very much  
okay too much time to learn  
yeah but it is it's is a <unk> it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about we already cover that  
yeah well fifty cent uh uh why doesn't and then we have single curved versus double curved  
honestly speaking i cannot imagine it so far but it will be terrible  
l. c. d. yeah l. c. d.  
so we have to consider that  
but that's not for me to decide  
yeah  
now i'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case  
great  
it's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well but i don't think that's the  
and if the only <unk>  
yeah  
yeah but  
so le le let's see what uh what people want  
so there was uh the improvement was also increasing as i was increasing the context  
i just couldn't um just one minute  
use a lot of but batteries  
yeah  
and as soon as we we we as soon as we we we are not in time we we we con  
yeah he's been emailed it while ago  
well they that could be anywhere  
no but i mean it can't be that difficult  
yeah like i with with the remote and i never new we have <unk> we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control  
mm dots never mind  
yeah but you have the same programme on the t. v. screen  
um and such maybe if an l. c. d. screen requires too much power or such  
uh we call that interaction uh models  
would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea  
so  
what spongy  
the ten numbers  
you're gonna put that as an output of yours the segmentation  
yeah  
yep  
no okay  
so that's really what we need to do  
yes  
if you see on th on the sides of of the remote you have the sort of scroll down so you have that option right there  
there won't be uh okay  
uh-huh  
it's got <unk> in between the mar the boundaries  
i think it does  
um well i don't know if you got the same uh pictures as i got but uh i got these two  
yeah  
well 'cause i'm i'm sort of assuming that that we're gonna have so an end point detection regardless of this working on this nuance corpus  
a mute button  
it's  
you didn't say anything about um evaluation and then yeah but we did that in the last report  
so you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it  
like what channel you're watching turning on an off stuff like that  
user interface concept we want it to be something simple  
yeah some more menu options  
i'll try to draw elephant  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um looking at other other devices  
but the there's there must be plenty of windows things for th that i <unk> output s. v. g.  
mm  
that sort of goes both ways but yeah we've got two mountain views  
you you de you implement the core functions in the  
a also i in the case i'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface  
it is  
there was little bit of bugs with some of the matching  
well there is some oh  
sure why not  
mm-hmm  
so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever  
yeah i really don't get it  
i guess we're on the right track  
<unk> th but there there are people in the field that are moving that direction like martin  
yeah scale model yeah  
well if we're gonna pick <unk> <unk> alright so we have to pick between one of the two  
fifty percent often loses remote control  
if it's kinda small this is is great  
the p. c. b. is uh inexpensive so we can put put in uh whatever we want  
yeah uh that's a good call yeah  
i don't think why you would want to use it actually but it it does work  
i don't know  
yeah that actually true  
uh making a profit of fifty million euros  
i thought  
uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the t. v.  
which i presume is like one p. c. b. and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra red sender  
okay  
yeah  
files  
they'll say it's perfect  
maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot  
um  
hmm  
so so so <unk> what what you would have have basically would be to have a directory which give you labels for some part of the documents  
i was waiting for the <unk> last message but  
and ho  
you just press yeah just click  
i'm sorry to push you but we only have a couple minutes to finish with  
almost impossible to misplace or <unk> or lose  
sure  
right yep  
i was thinking along the line of one curve  
and um a parsed version of the data which isn't at um any particular length  
yeah  
and did you have any questions  
and then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes  
but he he did mostly on numbers no  
mm-hmm  
but um i think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody yeah  
mm pyramid yeah  
yep  
even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a i guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging  
okay  
i'd say two or three for that one personally  
yeah i hope to have some value quite soon  
mm  
you did a little bit of work  
it isn't i think yeah  
okay  
i like that the voice recognition for the paging system  
is it working  
i dunno  
i think we need to define also a <unk> the set of <unk> for the speech <unk>  
okay  
yeah maybe <unk>  
but that was only for young people that preferred it older people didn't  
yeah  
we we have to get get on go through this  
yes but that's  
you can cold call her today this afternoon  
that'd be great  
well but then when you scratch it it does come off  
perplexity uh  
yeah  
which means magnitude spectrum and then you are trying to reconstruct the speech  
okay  
oh there are many  
but wouldn't it be better for the importance measure if that just wouldn't be part of it then  
and it's percentage distribution that you're going to want  
that's no different  
yeah when it turns itself off that's when i plug it in yeah  
yeah  
then we have a few um graphs about the market  
blue  
and the next one  
we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting  
<unk>  
um two advantages  
okay three presentations um you can go in any order you choose um  
um i assume that's what else we're gonna like <unk> ha the um the additional buttons we can use  
yeah  
uh it's vaguely connected question  
um seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot  
'cause um if if i can use it to generate um um the <unk> angle for example and the rotation symmetry stuff for it  
special form  
we could of course make the buttons wood  
yeah  
for facing this problem  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
so it shows um and so if you if you think about how the old version happened  
we can't lose the advanced chip  
scale <unk>  
right  
i need something to market about this thing  
it means it's associated with some physical thing but it doesn't have anything to do with the <unk> features i don't think  
and we can do that by simply searching for any constructs that have constructs as children  
we each have a specific task as i saw in my mail  
i'm not sure uh i just just came up with it  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
i don't think that's useful  
uh you will need to build statistical models of um the person identity using these measures  
yeah  
yeah  
like something that represents the whole series in in a <unk> in a structure very similar to the structure in which we represent individual um meetings  
it's cool  
it's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model  
just  
so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh  
the whole desire of our <unk> real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so even though we're stressing when we're talking  
except that ex no you don't know which one they're meant to replace  
yes  
um  
as much as can be <unk> in this uh thing  
i don't know why  
but of course you should go from this histogram to this which is essentially green  
to do remote control  
if we move everything to the right a little bit and make a little bar on the left  
and i it's it would be really nice to know that that much information that <unk> of the task information is being carried by the language  
you know i i think it's an interesting question of okay well if you have knowledge here's what you can do  
and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas  
and it sounds quite uh reasonably the two  
yeah here we go  
um  
yes very good  
i have all uh jean <unk> uh scripts and uh programs for performing the call uh routing i think uh starting from the phoneme sequences  
mm  
no no of this is uh really different  
wow  
colleague  
yeah you could look here all the the  
um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay  
but of course it's it's on the it's too long i mean in terms of in term of research  
yeah  
but uh very very good to sell  
and you have l. c. d. you just press your joystick you get here a programme  
the chunk  
but during the talk part they have a camera on i believe them 'cause i could see that guy reading a newspaper halfway through my talk  
new  
is that an option  
or put 'em in your pocket yeah  
or more like a four  
i think this isn't important enough  
and uh what if you have visitors come round they stay the night they wanna use the t. v.  
if there had been a fifth that <unk> just been sitting there ready to go the whole time  
okay great um are you submitting the  
our leadership was quite weak in the beginning  
so um uh mine is well she's actually climbing ben nevis today i think  
yeah but it's just uh three days between the presentation and the yeah  
yeah by content or by channel it's a good idea  
ah  
okay  
so so for me i think that it is better it's bet it's better to control t. v. so you know  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
i mean they can't <unk> specify when exactly they'll be there  
okay so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on off  
okay  
in the rubber  
mm mm  
that should feel have uh a spongy feeling  
mm  
whether it's fancy or not now it we have to decide  
he used to have before he lost all the data  
and actually one way to use this uh gamma <unk> is uh using these <unk> as some kind of newer scores for decoding  
but what if you worked from these <unk> that you get for every document and you said that in some some function that said uh that the gaussian representing this should be similar to the ones linking to it  
uh yeah  
uh if you don't have time you don't have time guys  
alessandro uh asked me to do the same thing and we i put uh we had uh like a password convention  
yeah  
equal  
mm  
yeah  
to fill in these fill in these questionnaires  
support for it  
a parrot  
'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler it's it's cheaper to make <unk> than it is a scroll button  
so this is franck  
for speech recognition  
so there's no menu  
well then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the <unk> like receiver on the actual television  
get into my belly  
so you can have like what looks like a normal remote control you know or like a minimalist remote control  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um  
oh this is it  
yeah yeah yeah  
i'll show that in my design  
should give it some time  
that would  
but yeah  
yeah that would be great  
yeah this one it's eleven twelve  
okay  
mm-hmm  
well if it's just up and down  
no flipping or you wanted the flipping so  
by concave sort of thing except for you know can't see underneath  
so at the moment the display is still dis coupled from it  
<unk> it should be done  
uh-huh  
yeah  
two of these this meeting  
but <unk> do we have uh  
but  
okay  
mm-hmm  
but <unk>  
mm yeah  
well the the what's what's new is in the transmission medium  
one  
an any <unk> any kind of thing you where you un unfold the model and look at it manually  
my coach is uh being very silent now  
yeah  
which kind of leaves you with an obvious way of making the same task harder and easier doesn't it  
ah okay is here he got uh his own  
is it bar scale like in like in <unk> yeah okay  
<unk> yeah  
duh duh duh duh duh  
do you think  
well it could be she would or should as well  
it's only just basics for for  
there you go  
industrial designer  
split screens and stuff  
the keyboard shape  
do you reckon if we get a copy would that be useful  
um second point we have to <unk> improve the most used functions as i said here switching channels teletext and volume controls  
so is um  
but uh but the but then <unk> uh obviously if uh  
and then between us we'll have to have another meeting and and i mean at the same time as we're sorting through all the other titles and and deciding um how to divide up the sessions  
hmm  
people being your algorithm  
yeah i mean oh yeah right  
hi there  
i guess those are the basic colours  
as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel  
yes  
mm-hmm  
um  
but with the the entire top with the you know the uh the infrared or whatever source  
let's try this  
alright and same sort of scale for functionality is it functional  
because the <unk> should be included which i think it should  
exactly  
we're gonna use a kinetic battery um we want to use a simple chip because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um  
and it seems you get more information by email  
and it especially because this would solve some of the issues regarding i mean like the possibility of <unk> of displaying videos after from from what we record  
just a okay alright  
and then it landed on the wall next to me  
so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components <unk> to achieve uh what we want to do  
if you just had it like wrapped round there  
yeah  
uh most of the words we use uh that's strange but are simply necessary to build a sentence  
yeah  
or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features  
yeah i mean i bet there would be packages  
yep  
in future  
i think we probably want to store um a hierarchical information density as well  
uh uh uh  
this has no function  
great  
so you scroll into it okay  
ah  
divided by nine  
z. equals two  
user friendly as as we all know  
boss  
why  
um  
zero zero and then you can uh  
nice  
functionality  
of course great  
yeah  
uh  
uh you would neglect it  
it's like really basic  
um  
let me see  
is that one or is that nine buttons  
yeah  
but ever  
yes  
uh second one is also important uh because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session  
maybe  
yeah  
uh no no it's not  
mm  
i mean we have to drop on everything  
depending on what is around like what colour is around and depending on the temperature yeah  
hmm  
no in these cases but  
oh  
but it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation  
it the voices are called <unk> <unk> uh <unk> uh that's some voice  
next meeting  
as our project document bit  
no that's true uh yeah  
yeah or confirm and back  
yeah i know  
um so this one is just for the <unk>  
pros um but you proposed um we we should break that down to have um the smallest um smallest um unity um of time duration should be one word  
no no  
um  
yeah but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something  
we don't well the first thing what you can really do is just to replace it by gaussian noise  
you can use your voice to to programme it  
yeah  
mm  
there's less space on this to put with the buttons  
so maybe there could be animal based you know  
yeah  
so that um when uh you ask for this frame in fact we can okay i just view frame source  
but it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built  
so i will start with that to develop some knowledge regarding that board uh that video board and after that we can combine both  
yeah we should uh i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design  
no but uh <unk> well you pick it up and you press buttons and <unk> well you  
and the expense  
a  
it's it's very inefficient  
okay  
and it is really the it and given that  
but all the files are here  
i i disagree but uh it's not uh <unk> it's not my place to disagree i guess  
no that's okay  
okay  
they close the electric circuit  
okay  
should we go with the yellow in terms of i think that's a really superior they're both  
i like this one  
yeah  
well once i've had once i've had a bit of bit more look at this g. d. f. stuff then start looking through that  
okay  
so th this is a <unk> next generation controller  
yeah that's that's true i think yeah they are are quite open to to this  
we've only got like what ten cents left so  
they are separate but are they a separate class  
but every individual module like the player and the display say like they still get sort of all the different utterances  
and it converge and so you have the boost uh initial p. l. s. a. and p. l. s. a. plus the link thing then  
okay  
mm-hmm  
we have six  
so but uh yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure why the why why i'm doing it now  
does it respond to voice recognition  
and um as a sort of team building moment um i i'd like us to  
third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design  
i think not  
yeah  
which in which when you <unk> when you first think about it you just think oh silence whatever nothing will happen  
uh i guess i can  
uh miss industrial designer would you like to go first  
mm-hmm  
yeah one  
yes so the it tells us something yes  
well in fact i i did not know i didn't know really what to say here  
this is  
no  
excuse me  
i can easily incorporate whatever functions it takes from into <unk> <unk> when i'm do doing the g. d. f. stuff  
hmm  
i decided to you know how i sent you the email saying that <unk> minutes will be complimentary rather than like repeating them  
we have to make um  
curious  
i think it is but i don't know what you think  
in  
so i don't know  
i mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will <unk> directly that <unk> it's our product  
so you're you're looking at triangle one right and all of a sudden it ceases to exist  
yeah well yes uh-huh the actual uh  
uh one is means highest ranking okay  
yeah yeah sure  
yeah  
yeah  
the case uh le that's what i wrote first of all could be plastic our plastic  
uh so so it's like you know if you have a mm mm uh um if you have  
ah  
and for the  
and then we'll evaluate after after we have redesigned it  
mm  
and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around  
to be fifty be four million  
we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to l. c. d. which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive  
so that's good  
no it  
there's about there's about three or four uh full time members of staff that list um philosophy of language as a major interest  
mm  
yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting  
yep  
of <unk> design team yeah  
mm  
easy to use  
so i'm i'm i do not agree  
yeah  
yes  
okay  
mm-hmm  
that is uh what was the other things you said there  
yeah  
so for example a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart  
and maybe uh just like some toys some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand  
yeah maybe  
yeah  
and that might uh bring back the costs uh  
and this presumably will apply across the board  
a <unk> what what exactly are we using it for as well as the age range  
yeah  
whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice <unk>  
it's all  
um sebastian did you write enough decisions down  
bob ross  
go back  
<unk> the remote control on the docking station  
speech  
well i think i have to make a <unk> an issue called finance  
i i think we'd be yeah no  
but that that that that can be done later  
okay so one more time  
but then maybe to go back to the to th <unk> something along those things then  
what is not <unk> quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover  
no no no  
um and then the detailed design will come after that  
and uh etcetera  
the <unk> <unk> mm  
the t. v. turns on  
alright  
uh what do we oh  
so  
a mouse  
better than that than the banana  
no  
yeah uh <unk> yeah  
yeah  
um project kick off  
cool  
yeah that's why okay if you don't mind me sharing the office with martin that's fine  
mm-hmm  
so probably you you may not need a very big microphone either  
<unk> if you could speed it up a bit yeah  
so uh  
right  
right  
sort of <unk> between the three of you and get things going  
yeah sure  
mister  
it's again a roughly estimated somehow  
uh because i think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen  
careful you are recorded  
d. v. d. players things like that  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
bob yeah  
and this would avoid batteries running out having to replace batteries and such like  
yep  
um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons  
and we need a laptop or you have yours  
and it's a bit too far into the meeting for that and into the project for that  
uh with the current remote controls the universal ones um you have to press yeah you have to press a code for t. v.  
so  
how are going to do it  
maybe like at the bottom kind of  
and then uh so i used the programme from uh software from <unk> p. p. a. p. m. to a. v. i.  
the uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material not just normal rubber  
yeah  
hmm  
when is triangle one not triangle one anymore  
everybody says what they what they want to say  
and that's where i'm gonna need you guys the user interface designers and the um um the other designer that i can't remember  
yeah  
should stay in the square here  
um  
right okay i think we've got um a good idea now  
uh th they'll certainly be time because i'm right next to the lab anyway i'll come back just to check my email and things anyway so uh yeah  
if you press like this not like this then you  
oh there we go  
mm-hmm  
useless requirements  
and then still have the batteries or whatever they would prefer not uh you know what i mean  
yes  
i mean we gonna try to measure how  
sounds good  
in their um in their message to me that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom  
it <unk>  
'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is <unk> <unk> yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um  
true  
if you push if you're just pushing these normally they're the menu buttons if uh the volume buttons rather  
here  
right yeah  
no it's not  
cut out some a lot of your market  
it's in blue uh and i couldn't change it  
it's it doesn't matter what input i give to um to rainbow  
any of you use of remote control for a television or d. v. d. or something  
cool  
i don't know what that creates cost or  
yeah okay so we lose that i think  
but i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours like if wood is an option that whole organic sleek clean  
yeah  
i'm i'm just <unk> concerned that that's uh that that's it's answering a question that evaluates in some way but maybe not in the way that  
that increases the the cost also  
no  
so that that's a whole other field of research  
okay  
mm mm  
yea  
okay  
but we we must remember that fancy look and feel is the most important thing  
then looking at individual components so that's actually a <unk> step further  
in dutch as well  
so that's no problem  
yeah half an hour probably  
visuals of this yet  
mm  
oh  
and maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we <unk> uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control  
i'll start with you  
you know with maybe some some finger molds or something  
each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal  
okay  
just escape  
on based on <unk>  
yeah  
and th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there just use a flip board  
uh yeah  
do you know  
or or you know can we <unk> can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less  
mm  
i'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions  
small  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh <unk> excuse that that's a bit of spam  
yeah  
most  
yeah  
mm 'kay  
yeah i think that's the right one  
so if if the those are students there  
well we will soon unfortunately  
we have a power button setting buttons l. c. d. window the number buttons  
yes perhaps you can integrate them or something  
maybe if i if that thing is <unk> we can draw a thing quick and then before it uh  
the same  
i'm louisa the user interface designer as you know  
yeah  
so if you so if you only want one black triangle  
whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just <unk> we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there  
hmm  
well some parts relevant for the search yes  
i know but so you <unk> you got a solution for that then  
um do you wanna start with david  
we've got point two of a euro left over there  
they need not to have any much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls  
yeah  
so  
i think it's  
innovative  
try first  
different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece  
hmm  
okay  
i didn't change this one at all  
yeah  
hmm  
it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle  
no uh i don't like the yellow and black combination  
form of fruit  
and our profit aim is fifteen million euros  
we've  
uh  
hmm  
yeah  
okay  
somebody will fix it and change it but  
the i will uh  
so we will have a <unk> portable device which will send message to the the main device like t. v.  
um six  
obviously failing this like <unk> calling centre and <unk>  
like basically just a <unk> down to one segment  
right  
uh it's <unk> well i mean i guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning  
um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow  
well uh <unk> uh there was debate as to how you would count them  
okay  
we're trying to get mind share about uh real reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics  
yeah  
i mean one of the strengths of this grouping was that yeah they all work with the closed domain <unk> and we'll do the open domain side of things  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well our findings  
well i think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product the easier it is i believe for me to market  
and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device  
yeah  
just by infrared  
mm-hmm  
just use your thumb  
so for example every time it loads the segment things it can't it can't not display words i think  
oh yes  
okay  
and one of the reasons for putting the reading room where it was is that you have a lot of light coming in  
so it may not be like very expensive because since we are only focusing on t. v. remote control so and we have only few things here  
you decide  
yeah they are less important but i think they should be there or not  
but we'll have that slider obviously  
by the way  
<unk> <unk>  
uh yeah  
a fair amount  
hmm yeah  
yeah  
and we decided <unk> the <unk> data for chunks would be probably difficult and maybe not very useful  
i think it'll be cost prohibitive yeah  
the sensor in the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal reacts appropriately  
well yeah  
so this detector uh detected the thirty shots  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
with a tail and a mouth  
yeah  
i don't think so  
perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes <unk> road con remote controls  
guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations  
yeah  
there it is  
okay  
or however you <unk> pronounce that  
for a screen uh fu uh channel setting  
yeah  
uh  
i dunno  
and then you just press the click when you wanna go on  
an  
it should just be a matter of treating a <unk> adding on the blink to the last fixation or something anyway  
and you will have in thirty minutes individual work  
again i'm see it  
okay  
yeah  
do you think  
but they are all you know mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small  
because there's so many buttons and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what and the buttons are very small and very hard to press  
uh <unk> no he gave scale to me then i generated <unk>  
um the height it doesn't change in value does it  
yeah well we'll work on it yeah  
yeah  
probably  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller  
it is  
so welcome to the marketing presentation once again  
uh  
oh after uh right  
maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device  
sure  
um yeah i'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy  
yeah  
that's why our product will always fit in your home  
in a few minutes oh yeah oh yeah i totally agree  
yeah  
user interface okay  
it's in the well uh next um i dunno who is next  
well you see that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it because then it'd just be rigid  
yeah  
this is a dead kind of fly  
yeah  
to add another dialogue act window is really easy  
not too heavy  
so i think that some things that we might wanna think about the idea of an l. c. d. screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on  
maybe for uh jerome  
alright awesome  
no i didn't do a sea no  
let's put it all together  
but i see that it seems to be how many shots do you have indeed de de detected  
anyway for for the users who who who opt for l. c. d.  
mm-hmm  
maybe we can come we we can talk to them and we can come with that you know  
no not a cat though  
so you couldn't the the words were in french and the links but there were no words picked up by the when i did the crawl for the model  
mm  
i mean you know it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time  
this concept  
and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch  
yeah like something  
you know what's  
i think that to be honest is something we can worry about at the end  
press the little presentation  
one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do like to <unk> zap  
hmm  
well alright  
but i don't know  
i like the r. r. that's gonna be etched in  
who uh  
<unk>  
so now we know  
i had to first uh write it down because i am not absolutely sure if i can draw it but ah  
uh the project is evaluated  
yeah  
okay  
hmm  
we were doing yeah  
that must be possible  
but of course that's not our uh things this  
fine  
target group and functions of the remote control  
which we can fabricate okay  
depends on the l. c. d. and but  
no  
yeah  
yeah i think that's all we've got to say really  
or my <unk>  
hmm  
probably case um material  
so where's the <unk> presentation  
mm-hmm  
to  
okay it was just a  
the the  
we've included it before when you've said this has been detected  
but is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and <unk> <unk> titanium as well  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
but  
what do you guy what do you think  
so  
yeah sounds good to me  
smart <unk> uh smart minutes but uh i <unk> diva  
okay  
absolutely  
i've never seen one no  
hmm  
so  
okay  
what a design  
mm  
well uh the most used button is the channel selection  
oh yeah 'cause every time <unk> be going over there you'd hear all this sound of  
use with  
and so now we don't have the lapel mic files  
so  
yeah  
mm  
true true  
hey project manager  
the th sides and the talk  
uh great  
shit  
and absorption and small clouds is out  
<unk> probably like what <unk> for example the word computer in that context  
okay here you are  
um therefore we have to to do some internet search  
uh our corporate image <unk> should stay <unk> in our products  
um so <unk> from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel  
which one <unk> oh  
like uh many uh uh <unk> widths  
yeah so um i'll try the red green blue  
well just just for the next meeting um  
with the lesser used functions on this part and then it slides into that part  
that may also <unk> that may be good for  
uh okay  
so so i found on a webs on the internet yeah  
oh but they have to drag it up past the mold line  
yeah but we'd alright  
yes  
so  
um yeah i think this material quality as well like i guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know apple <unk> been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know  
very good  
okay so i put rubber one  
right what's different  
but it is kind of frequency shifted <unk> or frequency modulated <unk>  
alright good  
so let me pose the question very broadly  
so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all  
um  
mm-hmm  
otherwise we are just like others in the market  
it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch t. v. in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost  
save it in the project documents  
yeah  
yes but also every other word in that sentence we should look at are probably in your list of fifty like list of all important words in the universe  
what are we doing  
we've got five  
oh okay  
uh  
but uh th there are <unk> other problems like um yes the the information display on the sheets  
yeah i think  
the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all it will still work um totally  
so uh yeah  
yeah so of course for example uh i wanted to know like if you want to have a a <unk> if you want to have the l. c. d. display over there  
uh well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine  
exactly  
and of course the final point is a fancy look  
yeah  
just fooling around with it and i came up with that <unk> shape and he came up with the sort of <unk>  
what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition  
yeah  
uh uh  
well we had twelve fifty i guess for uh production  
yeah and we could yeah there are now like loads  
from the management board i receive an email  
let's vote  
mm-hmm  
yeah but do we have do we need extra buttons for example some uh some have to  
no  
mm  
yeah is there an end signal  
no  
um which obviously it looks better than the single curve but uh you can't have it in titanium which is  
uh the <unk>  
mm-hmm  
so well uh welcome everyone  
a mouse or  
so  
alright  
yes i am  
if you add those together you end up with a the nightmare scenario i guess  
well  
that's the that's the basic idea  
i want to finish all these project when everything is finished  
um it's not really speech recognition it's more um like you can um talk to the chip  
definitely  
adjust  
two's good yes  
and maybe that <unk> divides it so it's like if you're <unk> if you're trying to get the t. v. on that's you know  
right  
no  
i would say if i were to make a decision i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance  
two  
star burst nuclei refers to a region within an object which would not be observed separately  
but it's the same as  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's badly written  
yeah  
should i bring it up  
okay  
if we aim for the younger people um and there will be uh a lot of features like l. c. d. or the the the speech uh <unk> <unk>  
okay but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know you don't wanna pear or a watermelon  
what's this  
which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel which i think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's  
okay  
yeah  
the beep  
the point is <unk> maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like <unk> we should <unk> decide numbers or  
the right files  
and it just feels feels different  
um  
that's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu  
i i think we we ended up being quite creative there  
i mean they they will be optically merged anyway  
so it doesn't slow down the eye tracker  
scroll wheel  
um so there will probably be another  
i suppose this is a  
oh  
because and initially it was a <unk> nuance trained on nuance uh no  
we know the reason was that at the time we thought i was teaching with herve  
actually doesn't  
where it should be this one but what if you'd un if these are doubly underlined  
okay  
have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use uh simple to use and looks decent and  
mm-hmm  
just increase the cost  
make it uh  
we all don't get it  
well not  
they want something trendy  
it depends of you if if the m. e. or u. i. d.  
it looks like you're already on your way for uh  
rubber  
this this  
mm  
okay  
but um let me i have two thoughts  
uh not like the exchange which which i i would like to be very low level utterance to utterance relations  
know what i mean  
yeah  
and th those young people yeah  
mm-hmm  
the uh the tuner on the t. v. is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll  
uh ha yeah all the framework is ready with a t. r. s. t. s. r. videos so  
mm-hmm  
right  
mm-hmm  
yep that makes sense  
yeah th this i. d.  
and you can navigate easier because <unk> with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal t. v. uh remote  
yes  
no it's i think you only need two points  
three frames dot h. t. m. l.  
sure  
yeah  
uh so you all know  
yeah four it's more reasonable so  
no that wouldn't work either um  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
yeah  
we'll leave that to the <unk> engineering then  
right  
mm  
two double a. <unk>  
okay  
and of course you have your own uh expertise  
because um cuddly  
so it <unk> it could be channel two channel three channel four channel five  
okay  
so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions as they inevitably do you can find them easily  
yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple <unk> you want to include with that  
hmm  
that's not  
and <unk> and the microphone i mean it can be very small  
i agree  
yeah  
the base is gonna be <unk> gray which is what we had decided and it's gonna be plastic  
if you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh i'll let you uh comment  
uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly i hope  
okay um let's go to the <unk> user interface then we'll come back to the chip i suppose  
yeah  
i can  
nah  
uh soft enough  
yes  
mm  
yeah  
no no no don't go that  
so th  
yeah  
yep  
she  
i  
um so you want to do  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's an excellent idea  
no we <unk> we can make it from the same kind of plastic  
ah there is matthew  
i'd forgotten about the multiple <unk> on an object  
rubber body  
ah ha  
okay  
it's easy to use  
for zapping <unk> because people are zapping most of the time  
for the options given it's the most spongy one  
that mean it's a very challenging project and uh  
i already have uh all kinds of uh  
i'm guessing a turtle  
cheers  
great  
um  
yeah  
but uh yeah  
but then you can move administration to the single room  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
but it's true that it's mainly water when we see things so it's yeah it's not such a big uh but yeah  
mm  
i mean is there any uh issues with respect to this  
okay  
yeah  
but uh we should decide now  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah but because it has the regular uh controls li uh as you can see in the screen now and uh  
and uh i'd like to add that this <unk> i think it's quite ambitious project because it's with uh the <unk>  
and then  
yes that's uh  
um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but i think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder  
and that was my uh finding <unk>  
oh i see i see  
for now uh this is uh is good enough  
you cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend  
no but he's relying it on it th this summer  
there are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have  
<unk> i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could  
we just have to wipe this stuff off and keep separate copies after that  
interface  
oh yeah this summer i oh i had to live with cats  
that's this here  
yeah  
mm  
okay  
right  
to go on from here  
yeah  
okay  
so  
oops  
mm  
so can we highlight the specific features of our yeah  
and also to find the easy to use uh part very important  
but that's up to the consumer himself  
i mean all the m. peg standards are basically this is the container we don't care how you do it right  
most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it  
mm-hmm  
i mean  
mm-hmm  
okay  
you address the the channels and like uh oh that's channel fifteen that's uh  
so we'll just have them uh standing there  
uh whether whether different technology um i mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared and like they have been for a long time  
yeah  
right  
and we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions  
do we do we change the  
well th those <unk> <unk> are are made there or just you just use them that's it  
so you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button  
i think so too  
it's a cat  
yeah  
but we we didn't because there was still a question that i don't remember right now  
we'll <unk> then we'll go for a a <unk> small small bear  
well let's see  
alright  
well there's there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing <unk> like a nokia it is  
mm  
so so so  
it's e. v. n. isn't it  
so i wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design  
well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can <unk>  
make a <unk> yeah  
it 'cause it's now twice twice the size of a  
three  
i hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random kit kat bar that happened to be consumed  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
do you think that people will get mixed up like they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then  
if we can  
mm  
that's it feels comfortable  
maybe even because it doesn't look advanced  
yes  
but  
very capable  
you you maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something  
i don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh  
please  
hmm  
yeah yeah  
yeah okay  
yeah  
uh i don't mind  
mm-hmm  
don't know  
so if it was running off of one battery as a  
okay but <unk> we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options  
and um so you you can go  
uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five euro euro  
um so you  
but  
so it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and  
but it's also <unk> <unk> easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you  
now we have to change that but that's okay  
never heard that before that's good  
something like that  
you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have <unk> you go you scroll to seven and then  
well um going on uh the specifications that we had that fruit and vegetables are quite popular  
okay  
um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing  
so so i don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room  
but that doesn't mean you have to be um using the techniques that you can be using open domain <unk>  
okay right it's a fluffy rabbit blue  
mm-hmm hmm orange  
your your department has a lounge and it gets used a lot  
yeah exactly  
ah celebration  
there isn't th so there are things in the eye tracker record that we definitely don't want in the g. d. f. format um like the frame rate eye movement  
yeah  
um and the the decisions that we need to to make today finally  
channel up and down  
well yeah so i'd give it a two  
six  
yeah  
mm  
pulses  
well it's just uh about our first ideas now so i think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera  
oh  
yeah profitable  
also the top of the banana  
well i don't know how relevant all of this gonna be  
yeah  
that's fine  
yeah  
oh if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes  
and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks  
so you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this  
also the speaker in the remote control when we want to retrieve it  
that that you can press it and then it comes up  
um  
like you just a a buzz or something  
we know that we can apply linear prediction model and it works pretty well  
easy minimal design normally  
um yeah already already told that  
like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange and uh yeah lower end  
it's uh <unk> <unk> um <unk> uh how do you say it  
so in our case we need to have a good processing of slides that in our case it means to transcribe with an o. c. r. and then make indexing  
come on  
hmm  
that's not their logo is it  
i got my personal costs  
so it has to be a group uh group decision  
so that was it  
yeah <unk> <unk> uh  
has read a lot of literature and i've read a lot of literature and we there is some overlap  
if you're not if you're not using it then i'll take it back  
banana  
uh the cows yeah maybe we could have detected things  
<unk> bad design that thing  
what would be the cost do do we know  
uh  
well if you <unk> if you if you got a channel up down we can have a slider in that as well  
yeah i'm just wan i just want to transmit this signal right  
that's good  
it yeah  
well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand  
mm  
maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen  
if we don't we we asks for more people maybe h. e. v. s. people  
so  
so that's out of the question  
huh  
mm  
the remote control  
rather than a line  
uh i have a presentation i just saved it in the uh the folder  
wow  
remember <unk> all the things we're looking at are <unk> with language with and without language  
hopefully it is there for people  
<unk> is really good at drawing  
yeah  
i i expect there has to be some sort of relatively <unk> liberal sort of distribution policy  
so criteria three is is it easy to use  
yeah  
i'm the industrial designer  
uh th simple yes the simple thing might cost you minimum ten thousand euros fifteen something like that  
you can sort of just make those out  
luckily yeah  
uh escape okay thank you  
to get the right reception and picture i suppose  
six is okay  
yes  
speech recognition i where did i imagine  
yeah  
and i think it's not possible to have just one class  
th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also  
because we are  
so none of those  
but not too big  
and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control  
uh we can't discuss it right now because <unk> no one of us have has the information to discuss about that  
we're really looking for something basic  
would that uh-huh  
oh really  
but like some kind of system where you can <unk> use something else to find the remote control  
mm-hmm  
i will investigate  
program plus and minus and the just the mute button for example  
okay <unk>  
um you will get specific instructions um of what to do in the next half an hour  
yeah yeah  
oh okay sorry  
and  
yeah  
well uh compared to the to <unk> the <unk> simpler simplest button  
okay  
'kay  
very accessible yes  
see if we can cut some corners  
yeah you can make it go  
um so that's for material  
but that's not really fruity  
but if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else you should use use an uh an advanced option  
digital pens useful  
it's not in the dictionary like if we again it's problem like so  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
it's going to be expensive  
hmm  
okay  
of course that's controlled the chip itself is controlled by the user interface  
<unk> shape for it overall  
um maybe how this can be achieved and um we need the user requirements from the <unk> marketing expert  
they are not going to cost you much everything is in house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this  
alright  
a a and the voice recognition as well th maybe you could uh could uh  
i think it's really easy if we don't merge them before hand but if we let them if we combine them in the prototype or don't at the moment  
and we'll discuss the other other aspects  
yeah so this one and this one  
yeah  
no  
that's about it i think  
yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control i think  
mm-hmm  
then you are to construct the thing  
and the buttons  
just just maybe yeah  
yeah  
and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour  
what did you call it  
that's true  
yeah <unk> kind of structure into layers  
so maybe we should just omit them then  
but  
what we <unk> discussed um then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria  
'kay  
right so i've got a message to say five minutes i dunno how long ago that appeared  
bastard  
uh  
a bit  
so like  
<unk> yes somewhere  
um  
hydrogen or <unk> helium in the atmosphere of white dwarfs  
okay  
because well it's maybe question for you <unk>  
so at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one  
uh mean we we can look into using the <unk> you know the little tiny weeny batteries all like special long lasting batteries  
isn't it  
area that i find rather jarring  
would it be something really that will increase the price of production more no  
well that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do  
but are we  
is there any way for x. forwarding sound  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um i've i uh it hasn't been divided up in that sort of way  
well the  
rather than having three different things that people have to do  
maybe uh i don't know some some lights a big but well  
oh my gosh  
and <unk> <unk> simplest approach that i came to is is to change programme and operate an electronic device remotely  
but you have it's <unk> uh we have five or four or something  
uh yeah  
but she wanted <unk> the fudge titanium  
and you was making comments on my dolphin  
i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy  
celebration time come on  
it's it's it's not a lot of work just one uh docking station where you put it in press start <unk> <unk> updated  
mm mm  
it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the t. v. and the t. v. will translate it into a function  
and um for example  
i think that's big  
this um self <unk> uh metal it allows for recycling materials  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
uh if people move forward yeah  
so that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about  
okay  
uh you've got line brightness temperatures  
but we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design  
yeah  
it's a television  
and now we're under budget  
yeah  
we could yeah but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example  
well i uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time but i personally give it a one  
'cause our rubber one is not fancy i mean it's different but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy  
i di did you um save this one in the folder  
um and then and then there are lots of different theories of argument  
ha  
these could be other kind of interfaces  
because we have two things  
yeah it it's  
uh you could dictate text so  
<unk> here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch t. v.  
wow  
so um but as  
yeah  
wednesday to begin with and then eve it moved down twice to wednesday thursday friday  
ye  
i'm not exactly sure  
i think triple a. it'll be lighter  
it's just if i then do it i hopefully will get the right models  
well i wrote it down here  
yeah  
you have to push hard  
anyone have any uh  
i mean i <unk> one of the questions is how the information is gonna be shared across these media  
yeah  
if it were if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote  
so i've worked around that there is ways i think to get around it but the problem is  
you just tell the television i want which channel  
okay  
very obvious  
so wait a minute  
it it's just a remote that talks to you  
okay  
okay  
hmm  
it's okay  
mm  
okay  
that's true yeah  
well  
yeah  
well i agree just put it in the menu structure somewhere  
well uh uh uh i did a speech processing uh course and i'm not sure if they a uh they also um mm learns that that  
um write into the call that we are considering the idea of having a poster session  
yes  
oh okay  
exactly  
yeah  
okay  
maybe it's more ex expensive  
yeah  
because uh everybody <unk> doesn't seem to be convince although it's quite you have good arguments  
that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate um i i <unk> for my evaluation based on what our competition is  
<unk> it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh you know what number's the discovery channel or whatever  
but then we should also add things that we think are interesting  
if we have uh then something standing here with the l. c. d.  
mm  
and and for colours we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey  
well  
and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote  
uh yeah  
no all play doh is edible  
which is the microchip um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system  
base  
well but don't you guys have um have this data  
let's see  
i don't know why this uh image doesn't appear this is the um um the frame that is uh uh extracted to be the shot key frame here  
mm-hmm  
i thought um the market would like uh a sort <unk> sort of titanium casing but they seem to like natural uh stuff  
yeah if it's <unk> if  
and if you can plug microphones into apple appleton tower computers i can do it there as well if you wanted me  
okay  
two  
yeah  
mm  
'kay um  
cool groovy  
yeah yeah  
if if i make the the the yeah the menu like  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and the the motion features can better show what's going on when there is such a difficult uh transition while with the histogram um  
still  
um but the extra step that we're asking you to do <unk> in this case is to look at the silent regions and listen to them for each channel and um make sure that no back channels were lost for example  
the segment at the moment is split up over  
uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation as we have uh experienced it  
that actually helps  
well there should be some <unk> <unk> between them  
wow  
yeah yeah it's flat yeah the shape is very boring  
no but set selection doesn't update the display though  
x. ray b. l. lax  
they just gen it just generates the video and so i don't know don't know if it's worth having a look at the licensing for that just to see  
uh  
it's so like difficult to to get to the point where you understand enough to really feel that  
mainly strawberry  
do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home  
yeah sure  
and also it have i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh  
yeah but this this the is for the  
okay next  
marketing  
perfect  
well i uh think that's a very interesting idea but um i'm not a very good industrial designer and i don't know much about what these things cost  
mm  
but the actual device would have to have its own infrared <unk>  
yeah  
in theory at least anyway  
maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that  
uh not directly  
uh yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others  
okay  
you don't have your remo  
<unk> <unk> <unk>  
just sitcoms and stuff  
okay  
oh okay  
okay  
we know what to do with the envelope or how to approximate the envelope let's say  
the buttons should be large  
if uh that would really appeal to everyone though maybe just to fashion gurus  
to get into menu  
'cause otherwise we'd be <unk> the same thing over and over and over again  
six point something yeah  
ah the department  
so is your  
mm  
yeah  
everything okay  
so okay the second item  
i dunno  
so i can use the button the mouse maybe  
you can point to a soft component  
mm-hmm  
okay so i think maybe we can agree on on the lounge in a separate room if we can manage to to find space elsewhere  
but it's a <unk> uh well yeah it may be interesting for your problem i think  
well the thing was they would provide <unk> an agenda with <unk> like several points but it wouldn't have a slide for each point  
one two and three  
that's not a component  
th there's just  
yeah  
it it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control  
alright your favourite animal  
yeah  
uh maybe it  
hmm  
um i clean a little bit  
that's exactly what it is  
shall we go for if we're going for rubber we think uh on as our case and then  
'cause they do that right  
i think that i think the whole thing should actually be marked  
it's bright  
also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment  
oh sorry  
um but i think that's i think that sums up the main features of our of the remote  
yeah yeah  
okay  
um  
yeah  
oh just like an electronic screen  
'kay  
or if we want to use the the latex then we have to go with one of the other um power things  
but it's not necessary to check either one of those two  
but i think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different  
mm  
and you can never know but if it fits well enough as a as an indefinite article then you might as well  
mm yeah yeah  
so um  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
well in the project announcement you've got the addresses i think  
is there a difference  
mm-hmm yeah  
one or the other  
i don't i don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo  
for all those that point to the actual words  
yes but we  
and uh  
yeah  
hmm  
like just build an another <unk> wave file essentially  
and this is exactly the same as last one  
we only need maybe just one  
that would be a worry of mine  
um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use  
yeah you tap  
so how much time we have spent  
and we have participant three which i believe is pedro  
we can go down till like twelve and still okay i would say  
ah i don't think i can <unk> uh persuade the management to say this is better for the market so you sell more than  
okay  
this prototype  
well i think yeah always <unk> but i think there is no way to uh  
two  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so it's <unk>  
yep  
oh yeah  
the voice rec thing i mean if if we're looking at bottom line  
it will be about the conceptual design uh  
i'd well uh  
my preferred would be dialogue act number then you can put both the scores in one file  
yeah exactly  
they don't know exactly what they want  
but  
or whenever they buy a new television so once every <unk>  
well that's also the okay button  
yeah yeah yeah  
so that's the evaluation so i'd say  
well i think  
yeah yeah  
it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there  
did i save it  
you won't be going off to your separate offices  
on the abundance all of the <unk> species actually use the old lines  
for typing in your channels  
left  
yeah  
yep  
ah i think you can put that  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
and on the charger just like a phone like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger and if you <unk> leave your phone somewhere  
are the rest of the <unk> uh are is the rest of what you're to do with that software fairly clear  
okay  
we have sorry  
but we don't have any basic options any more  
yeah  
and what was even more important  
so mm more research into that one  
yeah i think it should be a little distinct from everything else because it's either it's both <unk> maybe the shape can be a little different  
i if <unk> uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the  
so just really keep an ear out for those  
okay  
although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um  
yeah  
yeah this is i reverse both role  
thank you  
corp corporate  
yeah  
might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them  
quite <unk> i think it's a one for that at least  
yes  
we'll just uh open a new one  
yes this is certain uh  
oh oh  
um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five  
so if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable  
yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it  
yeah  
<unk>  
i haven't mentioned it here the scroll wheel could be used without an l. c. d. screen just for changing channel numbers easily  
well i'll make sure i make a i'll make sure of i got the <unk> the phone number in my phone so i can call them  
okay  
<unk> so  
yeah  
i tell you one thing  
yeah but they've made up that word  
navigate through everything  
hmm  
<unk> flat single curved double curved  
i don't know if we should implement that  
and i think we should have a device  
set out to solve from the point of view of the the consumer and the management  
uh no we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials  
um and finally whoops my personal preferences and thoughts  
well it it's  
let's see what this thing does  
'kay  
because we don't have a useful way of automatically evaluating um  
i'll go  
<unk> you do some individual work we have meeting individual work meeting  
sorry  
or th so you are the marketing  
uh then  
yeah yeah  
so we're down to sixteen point four yeah  
a metallic <unk> finish we were thinking  
and treats the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments and treats the individual segments within meetings as if they were um utterances  
maybe you can access through the network  
i reckon it  
bananas  
mm-hmm  
so  
these one are just for video and audio  
chip  
yeah  
there we are that's me  
so two yeah  
so this prototype is quite nice  
sort of <unk> you know saying that you want that particular thing tuned in  
what what's this n. thing  
yeah  
'kay  
it has to be ready in the next meeting  
mm-hmm  
so we yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay i'm going to tell you something about a trend watching  
it's just it's so strapped now um you know  
yeah maybe we  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
the they won't go we ho without that  
but i don't have to say anything  
yeah  
this is my  
i guess we just have to adjust things to  
that's not no those well that's individual actions  
ah good  
this is our final meeting the detailed design meeting  
do you know the new uh  
a new sound card is fixable  
well i i think that the thing is  
with the link here in  
yeah  
so push buttons  
so maybe it's a good decision  
okay  
no  
gives a protection because when it falls down or something  
what two i dunno  
yeah they're used to it  
mute  
what's the c.  
like i see lots of <unk> and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and  
on mute  
so that's the detailed design  
uh i think it's  
also yeah if if there's no pitch  
yeah i have to start our  
and you add cost to it um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component  
uh  
sorry  
hmm  
the d. v. d. to tell that what to do  
i think it's frozen  
which you cannot understand at all  
uh no no  
so if this is a time and you get one and add one frequency band you can see something like this  
marketing yeah  
yeah  
file representation of it  
in the wall or other things like that we may more efficiently support uh collaboration than the the learning  
international would make sense  
yeah so i think yeah  
so you you count one degree two degrees no  
do you have any um i idea about costs at this point  
seven  
right that's my concern too  
now you're trying to lose one point two so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker  
ah now this is the <unk> rule again  
okay  
yeah  
um the uh  
mm  
anyway okay  
mm  
yeah  
no they just made that up as well  
i mean i know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition  
if you hold it that way that's two curved  
yeah so did i  
yeah that's right  
bring a little picture of what i thought ours could look like  
can i just jump in slightly there  
okay  
our main <unk> age are  
that sounds yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball yeah sorry  
right  
okay  
ooh  
yeah  
huh  
okay  
um we want it to be original so a nice uh a nice new design  
you know which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control  
included in the menu  
we can discuss that uh  
yeah  
so why not on on side  
to just say where are you and thing beeps you know  
yeah  
but galaxies should be in  
it was barry  
why am i  
okay  
mm  
okay  
it's gotta <unk> look like it's in the r. and r.  
nee one battery with two small batteries  
yeah but then you buy a new cover  
now  
they are they're it's it's it looks like if you get three disk gone  
so this time we exactly know what to decide about  
so i would go for one  
so our experience of leadership wasn't really  
that was the the the the the technical  
oh  
yeah  
but if you got something from <unk> or matthew then i have those number of stage  
i don't know if if it if it will provide good result result or not but it is clearly a benchmark for those two goals  
uh you will have to work more <unk>  
yeah  
well you can break the ornaments but you won't break that  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
okay  
and uh i wanted to ask you <unk> maybe afterwards after after our discussion if we have some contacts in some companies  
just one thing i'm just wondering the sound signal from where do you execute th the <unk> sound  
these are only screws  
yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that  
um  
but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do  
mm  
oh i've not used that button yet  
but try to finish with the um measures and the call routing  
do you know the phone  
yeah one  
yeah so i think we can reasonably say it's another another one why not  
yeah  
so i go through all the uh all the points here  
huh  
with a simple command like locate  
what i understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make  
but it doesn't matter where we are in there  
oh yeah  
um zero  
yeah  
with david pearce he was  
yeah  
yes  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
in the meantime the industrial designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design which i'll presume he'll work out what that means  
it's my turn  
uh am i going in the right direction  
and the the curves which we decided huh  
if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty they have to actually need it as well  
so that's describing something physically rather than describing the spectrum itself  
and so even if it we won't it won't be used  
i don't know  
uh  
yeah sort of like off line create a virtual meeting which which basically treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting  
no  
<unk>  
but then we still have to decide if we don't label the source what do we do about the <unk> features that define that source  
mm  
nope  
what's the assessment  
it's more like tying it is still full but different um components are tied different components of the matrix are tied  
it's uh it's it's not a <unk> signal it's a slide with a <unk>  
no  
so you can have that  
yeah  
no no we we we should uh add uh a extra menu button and this the okay button  
they're my favourite pets  
okay  
this is all very very good  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
are you gonna do that  
because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually  
very nice  
ma ma ma ma maybe say say five  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but still <unk>  
ma magnetic oh  
yeah okay  
i added slides um i added a couple slides each time but that was about it  
oh nice  
yeah i <unk> i <unk> i would need the raw text pretty soon because i have to find out um how i have to put the segments into bins  
okay great  
yeah  
alright  
okay let's just put this down  
could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the  
that uh in a sense if you want i mean that that's at least the way i see the that list i have made for my own thesis  
so instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it and the remote control's inside  
and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well  
it's the figuring out stuff that gets harder if everything is purple  
you will as well  
uh  
oh  
okay  
um there are several components of um  
if people are busy interacting all the time and all of our colleagues don't even bother to control for whether people are talking to one another when they're doing these joint tasks because it seems to them to be irrelevant 'cause language is irrelevant  
it should be an even uh scale and five  
so um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
hmm  
oh well that's clear  
yeah  
i think a flip up thing 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well i did anyway  
maybe we should uh <unk>  
ninja homer  
thing is a at the moment it's just really bad for me  
what they might be looking for uh things like fashions what makes <unk> how we're gonna make it special  
the so i will ask you to do some work  
comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something i think  
yeah okay well i gonna redesign uh something now  
mm mm-hmm  
even if you designed it in some in a way that you know isn't a rectangle but still pointed in a direction that had definite points  
'cause she has said several times there must be somebody and she can help with that  
hmm  
my drawing skills are really bad so  
you already have that or no  
mm  
yeah  
i mean i think the reason everybody uses <unk> is that they're they're si simple cheap and reliable  
yeah  
<unk> you could add an extra feature actually  
right  
insert proper whatever the word is  
okay  
well yeah  
alright  
i don't know  
did he not say something about named entities  
okay  
oh  
we can go into that later  
uh i reckon they're sort of they got it sorted  
that's nice and he is fifty per cent so that means the office is not very crowded  
so we have five minutes to  
uh the one thing is the only kind of people doing anything like applied linguistics are the applied linguists themselves and people in sociology with an interest in language  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track next track and play pause  
it's not very promising but you know  
one hundred fifty percent  
the case is silver titanium no  
oh  
yeah  
but my code i've not documented the programme manager class  
um but other than that's really basic i mean that's all i have gotten so far  
inside your hands  
yeah <unk> that's uh very important  
uh  
because we need to investigate the financial implications  
sounds good  
yeah  
things to modify our uh new requirements  
what what kind of information  
so on front  
you ready back there  
so the utterances in the in the representation were uttered by two different parties that wasn't the you know  
export  
uh it should be trendy  
mm  
uh-huh  
after the opening um i am going to  
no  
spicy  
um the views  
you guys might actually have something in common 'cause she does well you know stuff for the video coding and gesturing  
and it's in real time on a reasonable machine  
um i mean those ideas i saw were just for inspiration i think  
yeah and everything is will be like this  
cool  
even even not <unk> just even something simpler  
yeah  
it's the it's the rubber uh  
and well but  
regular is normal  
yeah yeah  
um  
well well but <unk> those are different tracks of information  
yep  
and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera  
yeah i mean it it might be good to  
so the last one is seven  
so i guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do  
uh the well um i think separate channels  
'cause  
so do you think  
well unless sometimes somebody goes there or yeah  
that's right  
those are both both yeah  
so  
i'm a little um i'm a little hesitant about it because i'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside  
uh <unk> does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off hand first  
no  
yeah  
yeah  
the there's also in com com database yeah  
inch  
well maybe uh is is the white board working  
okay odd shape with spongy  
so this is me  
finish meeting now  
maybe the  
but yeah but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting yeah  
no  
we could maybe also <unk> um incorporate <unk> idea of the um slider for the volume with the channel  
so  
that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic it feels good in your hand something like that  
um  
it's a problem  
you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work  
mm-hmm  
you're use the zero  
up  
but if you move it then you have it you don't need to find it  
yeah  
unless people put something on the microphone  
yeah yeah  
yeah i mean i'm  
i confuse 'em  
okay something else nice to know  
no but that it wasn't one word that it wasn't like some proper name starting with m.  
uh i mean i was supposed to chunk uh some part of the ami meetings  
it's very easy to use  
uh it's a sort of intermediate colour i guess  
sure  
yeah  
and if you select those than it's having an  
yeah okay fine  
so we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery  
yeah that would be possible  
uh uh uh double curved  
however one interesting point is i don't know how serious you were there  
yeah  
but what we find <unk> what we can get out of the data easily at the moment is at this kind of level right  
um i'll probably tonight just work on getting a frozen version that works consistently  
i'd <unk> i i'd give it a six to be honest  
uh so that basically means that what a document is about lies on this space between them yeah  
and um power on and off mm i i don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off  
the infrared light at the t. v. and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever up up the top or something  
yeah yeah  
don't know  
but  
so okay <unk> but you have <unk> you need some button to flip this open  
yeah that's right  
should i take care of the web page  
and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or  
then you can re you can uh change them  
and maybe we should use this also as an okay button still  
so uh maybe to list down the things other than the what i've already taken from you  
yeah so at least we have wave files so now we can generate anything in the p. l. p. <unk> or so at least  
um i've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business  
mm-hmm  
huh  
then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations and we ought to do different codes for different t. v. <unk>  
okay  
yeah  
not a whole package of specialty  
but the screen is useful in essence but it doesn't work that well  
the first and the third point they are clashing  
so it's a three  
i think i think their being uh large or small is not important  
mm  
i okay  
it's like very basic internet  
okay  
i've i <unk> i think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller l. c. d. if it's possible  
okay  
smells very sweet  
'kay any <unk> 'kay  
right  
we can rid of that can't we  
if we make it little bit greenish  
yeah uh  
but at the moment it's not so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters  
okay then we'll overall two points  
i are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it <unk> the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for  
the same part the same part is different colours  
but maybe when we uh  
it does it's not part of the basic product  
i think it can  
sort of young professional kind of  
yeah  
yeah  
kinda like holding a  
and uh  
having said that are we allowed to take a copy of the <unk> corpus  
no  
uh they they don't determine the colour that much i think  
different  
it's not possible  
so  
when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your t. v. then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote  
so we're <unk> them about this because that's not the way they're supposed to be doing it  
a able to receive  
<unk>  
it's good to move uh from time to time  
no  
oh  
yeah but <unk>  
uh  
channel up volume up  
sure  
three hundred bits  
and the i th now we are  
ma  
ah well that's good five minutes and uh the meeting's over uh right on schedule  
but it's gotta be some more expensive so i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case  
we had a student here he finished uh one or two years ago but he left his software  
and if we are targeting at the younger audience they will probably watch more channels than the older people  
yeah but mo most of the t. v. <unk> nowadays show the show the  
shape colours things like that  
<unk> oh  
i'll go for two  
we  
yeah  
evaluation criteria is next in line  
i. m. galaxies  
okay  
mm-hmm  
we <unk>  
yeah or  
yeah no temp  
that's for the main functions i think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful  
do you wanna recap on that craig  
um uh the con today is the <unk> today  
for the company and the colours  
so uh you uh will have uh individual actions where i presume uh will be some feedback uh via the <unk> the mail  
i stick to five  
um and um then the buttons  
but i know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on  
yeah  
yeah  
i yeah maybe just yeah furniture or just uh some kind of screen  
ye okay  
you can actually uh place a chip for the l. c. d. screen and at the bottom and and wire it  
that there is not too much silence beginning not too much silence at the end  
we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it  
uh because uh what you get from from the microphones is uh a curve  
so yeah uh th the the main actions that uh you're talk about i think might be yeah built up from the exchange yeah  
by the way my t. v. doesn't have an <unk> <unk> but okay  
yeah okay  
they aren't are they  
with that pen  
okay  
but that's a good starting point yeah  
okay  
hmm  
or at the side  
yeah from and you as well i think just sort of acting as team leader  
to to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that  
hmm  
so we'd have a special colour special form and special material on all of them  
so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal <unk> presentation  
more than a banana  
yep  
operations  
mm-hmm  
but please uh don't be afraid of them  
alerts the visual display and says we have a new time frame and then they all sort of do their update routines with respect to the current level of zoom  
but you're already watching the t. v. you're not gonna watch your remote control  
that's the basic  
but realistically we don't actually have that many visitors coming in  
um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary  
<unk> in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping  
but yeah i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky  
i do hot have  
let's keep it at this  
no of course not  
so we have to make it cheaper  
nothing we can tell  
yeah that's nice finishing touch you need  
yeah so  
mm yeah  
yeah  
so what i was trying to encode at the phases so i just found that uh two bits is enough for that and you really don't hear the difference  
but damped lyman alpha absorbers are th are physical things not <unk> features  
any boundaries for segments at all  
yeah  
just because you know obviously i'm not gonna go rea off and read all this kind of stuff because i don't have time  
i think so  
both the um  
and  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
daniel  
different  
uh channel selection volume and buttons for text and the more um yeah  
yeah no it's too expensive  
but i don't think that uh we should  
so uh yeah if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection wouldn't have to really  
so  
and for other user interface i had um well it's more industrial thing  
not at the moment right  
and then  
they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control  
and uh with the technologies improving if we can get these uh  
also um so as as i told before uh it would be better if it's only for the t. v. um  
mm-hmm  
it's not as fast as you <unk> you know it but it does work sometimes  
hmm  
hmm  
yeah  
i mean they make some kind of processing  
yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit <unk> then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything  
yeah with a grip  
no very small  
no  
um  
oh okay  
so basically for him to talk about what he what progress he's been making and then for us to um for hi for him to describe what work he intends over the next period of the project  
okay  
you know  
yeah  
but the <unk> layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff  
so you have to be quick  
uh  
what time do you wanna do  
yeah  
no no  
yeah  
but is it a significant price on the whole remote control  
got those notes  
apparently we have to choose one or the other  
we're giving them a way to burn off steam basically yeah  
i know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep  
and so it it mi  
yeah it  
like  
you have to look at the audience  
uh-huh  
perhaps that's an idea  
thanks  
but does the recognition  
so we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense that were decision makers  
and then we will have an <unk> document and you just say this is directory one or two  
and i'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour  
yeah he it it's his yeah  
and can you detect if someone is laughing or angry <unk> uh there is kind of signature uh even if we can't really trust it uh uh <unk> one hundred percent of the time  
uh uh  
yeah well  
you know they're gonna lose their place or whatever because uh i don't know  
no no only one of them <unk> and two of them are just yeah  
um monkeys have attitude  
yeah  
right  
we don't want this  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i <unk> i think i think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material rather than per button  
to room  
we already have our role  
i wasn't  
let's that'll make us fifty million euros  
yeah  
and so that would be eighteen hours of talks overall wouldn't it  
and the parental control are  
l. c. d. and our uh our fronts  
that's alright  
yeah  
people may it's people may have some trouble i mean this is a dissolve this is not this should this should be labelled as a transition or not  
and we took another one  
they just mention that they want decision um for issues action items  
we can't fail  
yeah  
oh sorry about that  
i. c. m.  
what does cutest spelling mean  
do you think <unk> really go for that though  
yep  
good  
yes  
<unk>  
yeah  
yeah i was just kinda going by the web page 'cause they didn't give me any clear like yellow grey or  
okay  
okay the tool training  
thanks  
right  
strange  
i think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need  
a ball  
it's an good reminder yeah that's right  
okay  
the single curved in the sixteen  
this the easy one i think we have to to combine them  
okay  
<unk> so in the worst case um you may be able to make an argument if you actually need that week that you can collect in the mornings that week  
so we're here today to to have our first kick off meeting about uh this new project we're going to <unk> to talk about in a few minutes  
uh oh  
you guys  
if you make one big touch screen  
but if we do it in some way that it <unk> when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy  
well i actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote so yeah  
yeah uh well i'm gonna <unk> have a time next next month or in three weeks so i'll try to play some examples there for you and  
<unk> the young the younger people say that they like it  
okay um  
hey everything alright  
the weight  
and there's um get your mar marketing report  
but we can implement it with simple push buttons which is much cheaper  
mm  
so um yeah actually we um well basically the the group who produced this uh proposal is made by susan  
okay  
but i think again it's different no  
and the paging function works well that's good to hear we worked hard on that one  
mm like this  
so it was inspired by the potato so i think it's pretty fruity  
right  
module changes that rather than the underlying data  
alright  
the weight is later  
relevance is two  
um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches  
l. c. d. screen  
yeah 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub titles and things like that  
yeah  
and uh tandem approach  
case what's the ca  
uh these are the things we've looked at  
okay  
i mean you know those you know strike me as <unk> clear things that you know  
overall your department has doesn't have excessive space per person  
okay  
um i  
i mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um  
just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh  
true  
it's a <unk> working prototype  
not helping  
yeah  
i think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward  
or just just a wheel you know  
well that all sounds fine  
so actually so uh this is a very rough idea of interactivity  
yeah probably  
not quite sure what that is but that's the description that i received so that's what i'm passing on to you  
and again copying <unk> kind of for ipod mac apple's uh colour scheme  
mm  
uh yeah yeah that's everything  
that's right  
mm-hmm  
ah okay  
and it can still work and it takes the and the way it look like it it's still tolerant you know  
two buttons  
it looks like it's  
yeah okay that's true  
so  
the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really  
i think  
okay  
no no <unk>  
i didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires i was afraid i was gonna break something actually  
i kinda get this  
mm-hmm  
i appear to have lost my microphone  
so maybe if we <unk> if we go ahead  
yep  
and this is program uh plus  
we can have a duck tape casing  
a and we could use one of these for the uh <unk> what is it  
hmm  
mm  
yeah okay  
oh  
no today it was over one hour  
uh leadership  
if it falls it might crack  
and i can draw  
in settings  
that was on um  
will we go with that then  
yes  
yeah you get  
it's already too expensive  
uh-huh  
yes it's for it's li uh it's just for a little  
yeah  
and they are plug in the on the x. l. r.  
i think it's more like double curved  
we are targeting t. v.  
mm-hmm  
well you know it's kind of <unk> hard to keep <unk> working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team  
okay  
otherwise we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy  
so have we already extracted from all the files  
so right now  
kinda going round yeah  
and the reality is you know for me from an ideological stand point i'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell  
and then we have an extra bit i don't remember so i'm pretty sure people will buy the remote  
like he cannot have he just can speak only through some festival system or something like that  
oh yeah  
okay  
it's it's really a different style of uh there are people that don't put for example outline  
okay  
okay okay  
we can still do that  
yeah  
because of course if you just compute the yeah  
good morning  
okay the other ones are a solar powered cell  
or or curved at one end and flat on the top because i i'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides  
is it in the group directory  
okay  
and with your <unk> left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one you can see channel one  
yeah  
do we want to do we need to take some intern to work on this uh and so on and so on  
yeah  
i've  
a. is on a. is on a. <unk> mouse a. is on b. <unk> mouse a. is on b. <unk> gaze and b. likewise  
and uh yeah so that is this  
yeah  
i've been <unk> i've been wondering about that all day but see these look like they're that looks the <unk> that looks like it would be that way around  
yeah okay  
yeah  
alright  
yeah  
uh what i al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost  
yeah  
like a lot of a lot of what i've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what craig's just gone over  
so you <unk> should leave the menu button out of here  
but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us  
with two uh  
okay  
pitch i believe yeah  
different  
uh i'll agree it's unique but is it really  
basic basic television uh interface  
okay  
maybe <unk> <unk> rounds uh uh <unk> sorry  
well  
construct three right is a red triangle a green square and another red triangle  
it's the only thing it says  
yeah  
so if we stay away from it <unk> you know stay away from it  
whereas otherwise we'd thought like with this one or mix and match  
mm  
no for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip  
but that's what we are using yeah  
ooh ooh things falling everywhere  
hmm  
okay  
oh  
i <unk> you know i'd i'd <unk> yeah as we said earlier i've not never seen that before  
so aside from the usual angst which we all suffer when we go live  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
so <unk> user interface guys is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear or otherwise uh perceive  
just through uh the easy uh design  
yeah with <unk> rubber  
yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print  
right well um from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes  
but it that just covers the type of button we're having  
the first one not really <unk>  
um so i suppose that'll come out in our dev design development  
well  
mm-hmm  
so uh what are we going uh to uh to do  
coming back though  
beg your pardon  
certainly not for uh for presentation  
i've got some other stuff that needs done on <unk> so if you're not there at twelve i can just work on that  
mm-hmm  
okay  
but <unk> at the moment  
okay  
but it is very relevant  
we'll got back on that later  
uh we begin with the functional design then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design  
and they are very useful to human beings  
no just a uh turn exchange yeah  
but you ought to really train and then you're to kind of uh yeah  
yeah  
it might not have been a good thing but you've got two <unk> for it as well  
eight one to ninety one percent uh sixty six to seventy six  
maybe we could something about naming we could call it you know blackberry  
we're including observatory if it refers  
yeah  
um  
yeah i think we will go for a single curve no  
mm-hmm  
well it's just um  
expert don't play yourself down  
okay so  
oh that's true  
you know what are the problems in terms of alignments  
i was not thinking too much about the price  
yeah but we're all familiar with uh uh microsoft <unk> are we  
yeah  
there is mobile phones in which you can change the colour also of the lights  
you know to give you the correct look and feel  
okay th that's yeah that's one euro more expensive  
uh <unk> of the button sizes and i'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small  
if it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration  
which isn't doing much with the data except for sort of selecting a piece piece of it and and displaying it  
hmm  
should we see when the manual comes  
like literally two bucks for this massive i miss yeah good call on that  
true  
hmm  
so it's a keyboard in the shape of it right  
yeah  
so that kept us like basically from doing anything else product <unk> for quite some time in the last days because we were um hunting down that stupid error  
that's something i <unk> for say we're including three or four face plates it's gonna drive the cost up  
okay  
so let me get it if i press this button  
which is getting estimate of <unk> out of m. l. p. uh and then <unk> using these <unk> for decoding  
listen to  
well  
um the chip has to be more <unk> more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well  
oh  
mm mm  
or or do we or do we do <unk> and flat  
um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation  
it would that would mean you'd need a television that has <unk> in it which no no television does does it  
we only have very sparse  
<unk> feature  
yeah so yeah should we go with that  
ma make it with wood instead of rubber  
um you've got a couple diodes here for i don't know who and whatnot  
so the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber  
alright  
once you've been through the passage you've worked out what they're talking about you know  
yeah  
uh i have to  
right  
of course  
is everything going smooth  
well it is important you know  
okay but then you would would <unk> have to stack away your buttons somewhere else  
i think young people and yeah <unk> well every user would like that  
mm  
or should it be larger  
like my telephone it's uh it's sensitive too  
yeah  
yep  
mm  
why not  
but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together  
and we can instead of having instead of having you know  
yes let me just  
so uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given we have to try and incorporate so uh  
it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy then you could just tell me seven  
sorry about this guys  
uh no  
oh okay  
six  
beautiful  
the coding will always be greater than the ones resulting from this analysis in two windows  
hey  
the the idea is that it has to flip up to here  
they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it  
i like crazy ideas  
yeah what do you think  
because before i had <unk> and now we have two more steps p. l. p. <unk> and and and <unk> so  
because  
yeah  
the <unk> the whole window  
mm-hmm  
it's <unk> sometimes a bit difficult  
'cause like if you look at the train it's just very like there's no extra bits on it  
yeah  
with a with a logo like that because it's on a white background  
because in this uh <unk> <unk> this <unk> transform allows you to to find the right balance between how well it fits peaks  
so i th i i well i think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh  
um  
yep  
uh first <unk> <unk> why not to go to l. c. d.  
so it could be like a rubbery yeah uh-huh  
so um by how did you assign the dialogue act number  
'cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down so  
mm-hmm  
i th i <unk> i think if we're gonna go down that route then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that  
okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote  
so the uh building block of that kind of uh structure would be the uh utterance and possibly one of its properties  
so we could <unk> still have the comfort  
okay  
of the other ones  
true  
that's where i'm from australia  
i will  
so we i think we <unk> uh just to to discuss uh  
lovely  
oh  
that's true  
i have to teach h. m. m. and everything  
and if it if it was done yellow which is a company colour  
yeah sure  
uh-huh  
okey <unk>  
we have the the nite x. m. l. framework with all its functionality for <unk> through all the different levels whenever there's a change whenever something's moving forward and stuff  
oh yeah  
i want some you should do some trend watching because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything what people really want  
but you can also do it in the <unk> if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just <unk> there's also a button here  
well then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen  
'cause i was just thinking that doesn't make sense at all but yeah if you if that's just while you're waiting  
nah it's not really only an extra  
that's she would like see  
oh uh  
hmm  
so um it's not quite clear to me what the different kinds of things are  
yeah mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah but that's not it's ugly i think  
but <unk> al but we also have sample speaker do  
i dunno  
yeah  
presently it's it's not known  
thank you  
can you just yeah  
yeah  
ah okay  
this is <unk> floating anxiety  
i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that  
but it's going to be cheap whatever though it was set with i we've got a set price  
et et cetera to to choo well uh a all you you are saying about uh asking about band width et cetera  
maybe we should have a radar uh function  
yeah and possibly even uneven like not not <unk> yeah  
but it isn't three dimensional it isn't curved in a <unk>  
mm  
two thousand four i guess yeah  
you have still ten  
yeah it's one  
try to have that because uh i cannot say we have tried to have  
no  
mm-hmm  
so we have to comment out stuff  
this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product  
it's better if you have it uh  
yeah  
yeah something like on um some radios in car  
on these four inputs you can have only video  
no we we we can't make a docking station anyway  
so it might not pick up the other things coming from there  
these are companies or because it's not scientists scientists just start from p. l. p. and then design the new features  
marketing in this design  
definitely  
i'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext it's like what are we gonna put in  
mm-hmm  
uh uh i really don't feel the whole idea of an l. c. d. display  
there's basically two types of remotes ones that are engineering <unk> and ones that are more user <unk>  
oh  
so i think that should be our priority here  
mm-hmm  
um  
trying to fill in some time there  
yeah so uh  
yeah 'cause i have to uh focus on the on the basic look and feel design  
than on the with yeah i <unk> i mean like uh like on here drawing drawing uh  
okay  
the th yeah the but but  
i'm well i'm working on it  
i just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is i think  
and we will  
yeah  
uh okay  
'cause we always dump it to this other n. x. t. track that we don't need to load necessarily  
no that's not the button we're talking about  
okay  
b.  
a speaker sensor  
but um  
mm-hmm  
okay  
the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise  
and uh parents will see the will see the pro as well because it's um  
with diagonal g. m. m. or with this and with this with uh semi tied <unk> matrices  
just talking about myself  
and uh please put it in the project folder then huh  
yes it basically is the same shape  
yeah but uh then i i <unk>  
but that has nothing to do with the threshold  
yeah  
with a scroll menu a <unk> scroll thing and a l. c. d.  
i'll go back to my own presentation  
and uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a  
t. n. o. yeah  
if you <unk> if you take the exchange stuff it's not gonna <unk> quite do everything you want  
it's it's the whole set  
okay  
the excel sheet and price listing and see if we need to  
open  
okay  
yeah endlessly  
what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have  
just like in usual remote controls  
um  
uh  
yeah <unk> just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh  
a cheap one  
it's cool  
because it's not sure what they want to what the user's tools for reading d. v. d. and so on so  
because uh this will make about uh five seconds for each shot so i think it's very short  
i uh i i i don't think it's worth it though i think it doesn't really add much to the functional  
so unfortunately the people who were supposed to  
yeah you're right you have to  
it didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever  
yeah maybe the shape the shape  
i understand  
i just i just wanna make sure that a wish list yes  
well not everywhere  
mm-hmm  
okay so you yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
you start it recording and it starts recording what's on one screen  
okay yeah  
that's a good idea that's very original and that's can uh improve  
i it's yeah  
yeah  
not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours  
so uh time limited window of a speech signal is uh represented by some <unk> features  
well like four buttons up down left and right with enter in the middle that will correspond to a menu on the screen  
programme right  
we don't have buttons for the menu  
uh so that you know it's  
i'm not sure if there's information available on this but  
no no  
ah visual things  
i yeah  
but i mean in order to get to all of them you know  
even for the marketing  
but if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it  
but how does it display then  
i <unk> told you a whole lot more about beagles  
um  
well the relation names are less important  
yeah  
technical functions  
okay  
just by comparing their uh aspects  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
one is um the well i've called it word importance but that's a really <unk> misleading name  
and it has to be soft yeah  
yeah  
well one  
hmm  
yeah  
and i already talked about the maybe you have a <unk> familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it  
that's one thing  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons  
um will you guys first with your prototype  
fat document those  
so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or  
send  
so  
well i'm actually at the moment i don't see how many people can work on on the programming anyway  
thank you  
i only have uh uh relative information  
yeah  
yeah  
i think you have prepared uh all three uh  
we have to make it <unk> look like a fruit or vegetable  
well these would be the main buttons <unk> you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to  
oh  
we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find  
mm-hmm  
but even all over the recent <unk> <unk> training set in temp  
um and as you uh may have heard the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen  
so  
sheet so so it has the energy source  
yeah  
it has not too much buttons  
yeah  
shouldn't be  
ah just the uh shape of the buttons  
my head is going yeah  
go away  
how old now  
that's two things really uh close to each other  
so material um hard plastic for the front  
uh  
and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps wherever it is  
to we probably won't want to display ninety  
okay  
why you are you doing this  
<unk> oh sorry f. eight  
yeah  
and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up and coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it  
yeah  
so yeah so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the t. v. you know  
<unk> you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen the menu screen  
uh no  
um see ideal ideally i would've liked to have given them a bit longer  
so should <unk> did we have a soft component earlier  
yeah and just say  
i've everything in my head now so  
but did we skip the yeah you could do <unk> but what what i so what i but do you think we should  
mm-hmm  
right  
yeah yeah <unk> but uh <unk> short uh turns uh like mm or something very similar might be the uh <unk> second type of interactivity  
yeah  
i didn't think that  
well we will try  
maybe two  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
very fancy  
yeah okay i will ask you when uh i need the information  
i mean titanium would be great but i think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey  
no i mean yeah yeah  
only basic battery  
i think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider  
that's okay  
i in the file option menu  
which is a fairly significant number i would say  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay  
no no  
um we would have to look at that  
maybe unless something else comes up  
okay  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yep  
yep there's a blink sort of event  
you <unk> titanium it's more uh  
and uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications  
so what you're planning on doing it is <unk> it on one of the <unk> tracks and then splicing it off the <unk> track  
four  
well normal babies  
uh then you can also have like uh th um  
two  
yeah that's <unk> it's one of the most funny thing i mean you can see when you work in this thing  
right  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so it's a good idea  
no it's on the on the beamer i guess  
though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the <unk> apparatus can <unk> its function  
yeah  
and even if the t. v. set would have such a button uh you would have to walk to your t. v. and it's  
uh no there there is not  
uh but or if it was really yeah for the base or if we're going for the retro look  
alright  
yeah ex for your fingers yeah  
that might be good uh track to follow  
you can use a basic battery which we've already discussed  
oh  
yeah whatever  
um what else uh any <unk> i do i'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found  
uh so yeah  
yeah  
okay um then there's um how the case actually looks  
we even saved the ant  
standard maybe like established  
yeah  
just a regular uh remote colour  
okay  
if  
what are you what  
actually right here  
yeah  
yeah <unk> <unk> but when we yeah but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station  
no it's just if i i see the  
yeah definitely  
hmm  
and with and with the <unk> that we can all look at  
they'd have to be easy to use  
wait  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and the main components in there are the  
you're going to work together  
and then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes  
i i uh no i think it  
yeah  
no no no no  
because it's uh like it it's for something very similar  
sorry about that  
but uh th given that the kind of thing is that that this named entity <unk> task is is a much is a much more uh literal thing  
i'm sure it's fun  
oh  
so if you like if the whole meeting is selected it compresses the whole meeting to five minutes  
this we this we buy i think because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves  
yeah  
oops  
um  
no but but i think uh de  
it it it it breaks in your  
so that was something i wanted to add and perhaps some <unk> aspect  
so we're going for plastic yes  
<unk>  
um  
so  
if you have older people or people like me that aren't very co <unk> hand eye  
no  
that's gonna be difficult huh  
un unsure of yet  
oh right yeah  
uh so have i made that clear i'm i'm not sure if i'm explaining this well  
it's good  
so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone  
hmm  
yeah  
i <unk> i remembered not marking nebula or clouds or  
up  
and the design it should differ  
wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something which <unk> displays all the all the values all the channels which are possible  
but yes they are separate  
well uh as i mentioned ready we have some <unk> well it may be possible but uh i figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget  
yeah  
so what we could do is something like an old fashioned telephone like this  
right  
so in that sense there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process  
with f. f. t. you can just uh as i said <unk> look at the phase between the microphones at a given frequency  
yeah  
alright well thank you for those informative presentations  
i i think  
oh okay  
okay we'll have to deal with it like this then  
no  
um  
but they can normally do most things right handed so i would say it's not such a big issue  
uh um yeah and  
and uh just before starting the detailed discussion maybe we you are the marketing guy  
because they just show usually they have a camera on you and a camera on them  
mm  
so  
list of agreements  
oh yeah  
just little arrows that you could feel maybe  
you just  
uh or from nathan and ron and from sarah about what we can do here um and what  
we have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy  
oh  
yes maybe we should phone him  
probably they're just slow at loading  
there is a very small um interval  
so you used uh this  
yeah  
where of a joystick to control the very basic functions and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile  
some yeah  
i see so many of 'em out there  
what's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic  
you're right  
um what are we going to do  
yes  
okay so  
okay  
yeah  
what uh what uh do you want to discuss  
so we have one button  
hmm yeah  
yeah  
there's two <unk> one is swedish one is finnish  
yeah okay  
okay  
yeah  
at the beginning he um talked quite a lot about that  
uh ah okay  
like double value or whatever like one decimal value or whatever onto onto exactly their segments  
well it's not that the word is if the word were the whole word were being used four times  
buttons  
so anyway that is the first user interface could be of more than one type  
because i think that's kind of overdue  
isn't that the answer  
it's on the back  
i haven't  
yeah  
along with the new user requirements  
mm-hmm  
that's kinda  
okay  
i like it brilliant  
yeah  
no no it has to be curved  
we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five sell 'em for thirty but that's something that we can have finance deal with  
or at least yeah i don't know if it's really the scroll but the menu they like most  
evaluation  
i think it it will attract uh  
what's on the uh on the left  
on off  
that's the only  
'cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said <unk> cool  
so yeah yeah  
um  
i guess that is that is that about it  
hmm  
ebenezer  
i mean they everybody acknowledged the the other week that we that we had priority  
hmm  
uh you can draw it if you yeah  
these are uh comfort issues  
so yeah  
yeah well but i since it's made of rubber anyway  
uh  
usually  
i think we uh al already uh been through that part  
'cause she did represent um discourse structures 'cause these were the <unk> scheduling dialogues  
hmm  
yeah but it's it's more about the energy source huh  
um or if is that a function we want in the remote  
you read the newsflash  
'kay  
yes he have a picture of it  
click  
seven  
um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume  
how does how does computers and teletext <unk> how why is one eliminating the need of the other  
too bad oh  
does everybody agree on that  
that's up to you guys  
sixteen  
you're fired  
yeah  
mm 'kay um well yeah i guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah i know that's perfectly viable question  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i'm a bit short on cable  
okay uh  
okay  
<unk> to posterior  
oh go on  
yeah the basics then by a volume channel one till two zero numbers on it oh teletext doesn't have to be  
but just the um uh just in one button if possible  
my method  
right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add um  
i think it's  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah it's got like big antlers yeah  
so we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again  
yes  
f. f. t.  
yeah  
mm  
'cause i could get it backwards easily you know and so it is just as well for <unk> for you to check this  
uh just a left uh  
right  
no the chip composer marketing  
volume selection okay yep the teletext we're gambling with and we're gonna say it's dead the way of the dodo  
mm-hmm yeah  
chip set  
looks good  
yeah it's good  
uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved  
yeah i can bring my laptop if necessary yeah yeah  
you know if it's a female speaker for instance you yeah  
yeah  
okay first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up which was uh current cost of the competition devices  
so the idea was good  
so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes  
no no now it's uh well for the video you saw it wa it's <unk>  
yeah  
it <unk> it shouldn't it shouldn't be <unk> symmetrical  
and then we could like we could sort of use the same thing for um yours and mine  
so you have the up channel  
so um  
two two two two two  
okay well um  
wow  
yeah  
i mean it  
but you could have uh structure it a <unk> little bit more  
it's also round  
mm  
mm-hmm  
do we think <unk> <unk> in the in the wrong folder maybe  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
even though this is coming from us as you know trend watch market research i don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away  
well the speaker and the microphone i think are the same uh little hole thingy  
at the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up which was kind of fun  
no  
uh i think so as well yeah  
okay  
known to lie in the direction of high velocity clouds  
mm  
uh  
right  
i mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function  
that's the claim  
<unk> 'cause floods are more important than dialogue structure i'm afraid  
so i so we want to design uh elegant easy to use inter interface  
it uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore  
the second most important aspect is that a remote <unk> that the remote control should be technologically innovative  
you're the only one  
essentially if you were in <unk> domain you would compress the power spectrum  
to have mm-hmm mm-hmm  
um  
so  
uh oh i've hopefully well i won't hopefully need it for more than another week or two anyway  
yeah  
i bet that'll catch on well  
okay well that's that's in the <unk> okay that's a good to know  
because yeah we have the sketch but  
but uh what i'd thought before was could you get people to evaluate this by by hand basically  
yeah but still  
okay um  
and give it an acronym  
uh  
true  
no so they want us to restrict the remote control to t. v. only because of time limitations  
this is where my people screwed up basically  
and i just uh have one more idea  
wow  
if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be <unk> wouldn't be <unk> <unk> yeah yeah  
i don't think it's gonna take that long to get its stuff sorted out  
<unk> some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements  
and minus  
i'm the project manager  
and where i was living in cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening  
i mean  
no we don't have to but seems it's the trend  
it means that uh  
if it's just like i have arbitrarily long lists from the british national corpus of when <unk> usually  
i don't think that counts  
it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with  
and for <unk> and these things you really shorter like even around less than twenty milliseconds also  
mm  
yep  
yeah  
okay  
so  
oh yes  
yeah sure  
and maybe want to access a a menu or something  
mm  
yes  
if basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad  
that's not really what i meant  
nothing related here to the  
huh  
well one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types  
well i have the i can draw it again and i know what i did wrong  
no  
we have not uh thought a lot about it  
it's bound to increase the cost of it a lot i would've thought  
the closer a network is to being a small world network  
mm  
i don't know  
eco ergonomic  
and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward  
no  
no  
mm  
maybe we can but we have to decide it we can put the the the fancy <unk> look of vegetables for instance  
i suppose yeah  
so  
anything i've missed  
from uh our bosses  
okay well if we can do that great  
again  
yeah we could just widen it out uh  
forgot to say that  
well  
no  
but the new ideas found for uh <unk> with working with this uh software  
okay thanks  
is there mm  
you waiting for me  
it will be a  
but we do have thirteen different dutch channels  
but the scroll wheel requires a mini <unk> minimally a regular chip which is in the higher price range  
and then you can just skip manually through them using i think we should just put one teletext button on it  
we don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up  
uh scroll wheel  
yeah but then you had the same thing  
then if we look at this slide uh these are in your shared documents you can see like  
so i say inspiration so having something beauty something attractive uh something that in a sense will sell itself  
so if you wanna show something put it in the shared folder  
mm-hmm  
do you agree  
so maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal  
mm-hmm  
yeah tomorrow  
i always  
'cause  
yeah 'cause i have there is one dialogue where i think two speakers are french like one is definitely french  
that's um  
hmm  
and i just missed when i was typing the r. r. stands for  
right  
yeah  
oh  
no  
so  
um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good so a bit of imagination  
i think the battery option  
more accurate numbers  
we could also try to do the hinge thing so it could like flip out that way  
yeah  
is that clear enough  
in states we don't have it but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather kind of sports  
so i would say at least two  
so you can  
yeah  
well if you  
okay  
um sorry can we just go back th uh one page  
it's already incorporated a little in that concept  
but it and i think we have to make it quite big  
yeah  
okay  
so if you drop some frame  
it makes a noise there's a button on the t. v. that you press and  
mm yeah  
that they don't go oh we're just getting rubbish from <unk> you know what i mean  
um we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the <unk> that we've just seen  
so external  
don't ask him what happened to the promise that you'll get your script where you can use your own stuff because actually that was sort of ready but then we sort started trying to get something more working and then we got into big problems  
but that would <unk> that would probably be quite expensive  
but you can go <unk> if if you did it from web mail  
would yeah would buy  
and that's associated absorption lines  
speech recognition um interface we don't know that  
um so  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
mm  
yeah well the size doesn't really matter <unk> i mean side  
because that was i th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost  
uh-huh  
yeah 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function  
uh yellow with uh  
mm-hmm  
first we're gonna start off by using our tools  
we need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um  
then do you transcribe more phonetically or do you put uh uh a star of after every single one word  
yeah different  
then th they some you know source  
yeah so  
it con it controls the speed  
yeah that kind of thing  
yeah  
and in case if we're we all agree on the <unk> of um building of this remote control we'll evaluate the um production  
yeah  
single curve  
so this we did  
well uh it i'm even not sure if it's that important to know which person is talking because uh if uh if it i think about a table  
conceptual design yes  
how did you guys enjoy making the model the prototype  
'cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating  
so um  
but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense  
yes  
so um  
okay um i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control  
oh okay  
mm  
yeah  
yeah absorption profiles i'll go for  
alright  
that's a bad bad com commercial for okay  
daniel  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah  
i think it's uh it's a two at least  
yeah  
oh okay  
um  
mm  
at least in no i'm uh talking now about um the meeting  
mm-hmm  
uh maybe how can we if we have a soft thing  
hmm  
sebastian  
but does it uh i then should <unk> just use uh i instead of the stick  
how easy would it be to make it so you can add arbitrary numbers of them do you think  
um oh yeah  
mm  
uh  
um oh yeah and the images are sent to your browser the client to this browser  
but on their side th the the volume button is on the side because you <unk> grab it like this  
okay  
um depends how quickly i manage to get a grip of it how long it takes me to generate them or how i get on with the <unk>  
components  
battery there  
right  
the working bout it uh of it  
first the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work come into a meeting the <unk> design  
everybody happy in their work  
it's true  
mm-hmm  
uh i think they still do their job  
okay  
yeah <unk> around february or march  
the fact that martin is said he would be quite noisy fifty per cent of the time  
mm-hmm  
but i dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product  
um there we go  
two  
with the switch button  
sure  
yeah  
yeah and if if anybody manages to run it down we'll we'll give 'em a new one  
yeah cause i this is a very frequent mistake that no native speakers make to say circuit instead of circuit  
um it's only a very small step to add  
one <unk> on i it's the colours and the  
between this time this time you're not looking anything  
effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything  
experience with the tiger  
is uh isn't that different from every television  
okay okay  
okay then i'm gonna give it a two  
imagine <unk> are you right handed  
do we keep the shape doubly curved or <unk> do we go for single curved  
yeah and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the  
i i thin i think it will not take lots of place we just need a microphone and the software  
and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch  
but it's actually kind of uh well it resembles the design i had in mind for this <unk> you know the the <unk> <unk> kind of design  
is that the end  
we discussed that last time and in actual fact that was <unk> pretty well what we came up with anyway  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah the next not so much so  
what was our target price again  
mm  
whatever cost uh cost uh the least  
maybe  
it's either nathan or participant two  
yeah  
cool  
yes absolutely  
<unk>  
<unk> young people <unk> yeah  
mm  
and i don't think anyone would be too offended  
no  
nine and ten and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock  
that's our only sound record  
so <unk> um i'm sort of getting that you think there is a lack in the uh theory to do with exchange structure at the moment  
um  
genevieve  
yeah  
let's make the let's make the case plastic  
so there can be a triangle which has a. <unk> gaze in the centre and your gaze actually happens to be here  
mm  
<unk>  
'kay thank you very much um i'll take that back  
oh  
yeah  
yeah  
mm maybe with some whiskers  
hey we could have a variety of options here  
and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful  
we can try to ask  
right  
i mean i <unk> i wanted to make sure that um  
uh i <unk> yeah  
okay  
and if they appear five times in the meeting and they have each time a different  
well you don't have your models or do you  
hi team  
uh yeah uh  
then uh one basic thing i suggested even thinking about i mean is exactly this <unk> all these scenarios that can be a meeting  
yeah  
so maybe this is better to send it by email  
the um not the what is the next phase <unk> flores  
nothing true is is everything is chance pretty much  
like effective um circuit including all the wires and everything like that  
mm  
i thin  
mm-hmm  
no  
i mean that that th  
that that looks cool you know so i would actually give it a three  
ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest  
okay  
th yeah most of the most of the time you have the title to do no  
well wait a minute  
um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things  
maybe it's the kind of push buttons  
yeah  
so we have  
we're we will have to find a <unk> a regular standard chip to to do this with and i i um i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around so  
would <unk>  
mm i thought they were local to th a particular meeting  
yeah <unk> band g. s. m. yeah  
no no no no no  
<unk> yeah create all the uh switches and whatever else you need to do  
right  
still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how <unk> easy we can do and within our <unk> range  
okay nice and obvious there if it's standing up i guess yeah  
it's copy  
can you with a small lithium battery  
right so shape of buttons simple  
so what about location and these things people are really interesting on those features  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so  
so um while these schemes may not have they have some es of the essential components that you need to <unk> um joint problem solving  
okay  
shift f. eight  
but in addition with simplicity  
yeah  
it's almost four  
'cause  
yeah it's  
'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons  
uh right so  
yes  
yeah and the light  
thanks for coming today  
okay um  
how did it work  
mm  
six hundred  
some people might like them  
um and then the other thing that we we're <unk> we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity  
um and we're going to calculate the production costs and if they are uh under or at twelve euro fifty  
so it could just  
okay  
and its buttons  
i think that might be a little impractical though  
then i think <unk> we could be able to handle that  
whatever  
no it um i think it's not uh versus the whole corpus  
okay  
yeah  
and then you can uh and then you can interpolate yeah  
or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself or sort of the instructions that would come with it  
and you all arrived on time  
uh  
yeah leadership  
yeah if we want it to be more thin then we'd probably wanna go with a triple a.  
mm-hmm  
oh could it be hard and then something around it  
it's  
right  
to not use batteries and use <unk> uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure  
oh yeah  
i'm i don't know <unk> did you have that information behind the marketing or was i meant to give you that information  
you're gonna get lots and lots of stuff  
so we need a rule for that  
i'd give it a three for this for that  
the <unk> the <unk>  
i had only one document left  
but  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
um  
i only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big  
yeah because you have <unk> but you have l. c. d. screen  
mm-hmm yeah  
yeah  
so it's yeah marketing expert  
communicate  
mm-hmm  
i i think i'm a  
jules from um psychology  
what they prefer what they not prefer <unk> what problems they do encounter in all this type of things  
okay  
uh-huh  
mm  
and you'd come and sit down and ooh the <unk> the television switched on or something  
uh <unk>  
maybe we could have key buttons like uh discovery <unk> like documentary channel and movies channel and  
or one of us will  
uh then we have left  
but  
yeah  
<unk> or more likely  
so that would be that sounds like a really good size if you see it there  
uh yes  
but we save one euro that way yeah  
uh <unk> like yeah  
always the you  
mm-hmm hmm  
okay so what this is is a set up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a  
yeah okay  
so now we're either going button or l. c. d. <unk> l. c. d. display  
the card  
alright  
now we could be really unlucky and somebody would expect us to do that at the real frame rate  
yep  
yes  
if you could find out that uh  
where do you have to save it to  
not special colours an interest in  
yes  
instead of a  
anything which is done in the last two years is the one which is  
yeah that's good  
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen  
or do they annoy you sometimes  
yeah  
so now uh we will have three presentations  
<unk> on and off  
there may uh uh be there in your uh t. v. room this one will stand out i think  
you just you just find out and  
question number four yeah  
and david is a half time  
okay  
but if you <unk> but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure then you can sub group them  
barks  
basically  
yeah  
actually that doesn't seem to be working  
like if you want to jump to a point you need to be able to jump more accurately than half second  
would be a nice idea though  
so uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t. v.  
yes  
okay  
but you will you do need uh also an uh also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well you know  
and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness  
we still need the buttons in the same places thought don't we  
okay  
right okay  
oh just if it was kinda the same way that a cell you know how a cellphone will light up for about ten  
it's not it's not quite a a face plate  
um the second thing is uh  
so that doesn't mean there aren't other theo so for  
uh  
you wanna vote  
we're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area  
a mouse is not too difficult  
aye yeah  
no doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program <unk> other things that i'm not very coherent about  
notice you have a number ten button  
of course and first before um designing the <unk> well thinking about the <unk> we need to know what are the user requirements  
hmm  
<unk> <unk>  
mm-hmm  
we could do  
yeah i think  
'cause uh and i think of voice activated i think of of how many times i've i've lost my my remote and i can't find it  
individual i think so  
this  
user interface right  
yeah but that's a decision we're forcing on the user when we don't have to  
so there'll need to be two separate <unk> videos generated  
european v. l. b. i. net  
now people are very frustrated <unk> with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is  
hmm  
some kind of physical actions yeah  
yeah <unk> with the colour um does it have to be all yellow do you know  
is that at least identifiable  
like um  
we've not hit the five minute mark warning yet but  
um where the button is actually blue but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow  
just the casing  
it means that it can recognize  
alright take out teletext but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people <unk> <unk> some people that want the whole functionality away  
i don't think  
so basically apart from the display module the i the display itself  
yeah  
about mute  
it should be this one here  
'cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button  
mm-hmm  
uh first of all energy source we picked battery  
so i think we should go with that  
it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though  
yeah  
yeah  
because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
tables number  
yes  
yeah um  
i know but but if we use uh like a stick for example um  
that's the basic fu that's what you do i'm not sure who present that again  
yes  
yeah i'm pretty sure it's already there  
but we just have push  
mm-hmm  
or a small one just like in a laptop  
well we could say well this special colour that isn't that that isn't there because the the fronts they will buy it  
reports rep <unk> response to it  
oh  
here we go  
um i hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t. v. like you have to do one for the power of the t. v. and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going  
i think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile  
so i wanna eat my lunch today  
i'm not i'm not sure what what what the sort of <unk> we're thinking of selling the product over is  
yeah  
the like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that  
no probably not  
what it is we're trying to achieve so and then we have one one <unk> theme that we stick with  
no  
in the room  
at the beginning it started out and i felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and i was like had like all this brainstorming i was doing and then suddenly i was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away  
yeah that or not yeah  
but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for  
and after that is and the question is how to <unk> to to to make both card working together  
and i think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh  
'kay  
five and then thirty six and then zero one again  
oh  
yeah i don't i don't see the logic  
so maybe you should go back to your own offices  
one battery  
this is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here  
so just like whatever three means agreement value and then i'd just write something agreement  
yeah  
so this <unk> this button will be used both for the <unk> and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use  
and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions  
oh something coming now yeah  
no titanium  
so  
thank you for the information  
actually one one wee thought about that  
yes  
and else to one and through after that  
i think  
so they say either so there it's really not ambiguous whether it's just laugh followed by an a normally spoken utterance or whether it's an utterance spoken while laughing  
it doesn't in fit the same frequency over time domain  
so  
yeah  
um the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the <unk>  
and then finally we have um the martian or the pear either way  
oh what what is the topic here  
anything else  
would you maybe have like one menu button then you'd use the other buttons maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions  
sorry  
um  
fifteen  
oh  
yeah i wasn't really sure what that was  
but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be <unk> more in the remote  
well we could we could include either here  
you know will be wooden in wood and it can be interesting  
the data from a. b. and c. and so on and so on  
if you got uh a a a base a base like this i won't draw it really  
i was thinking uh  
okay  
yeah remember it's twelve euros  
okay  
and then we could be left with uh fifteen blocks for um the rest of p. p. l. s.  
um we're here to develop uh a new product  
and after that we uh will have the  
you know i mean the typical thing is to do leave one out cross validation with you know eighty nine dialogues  
right  
four  
so once i write an <unk> like <unk> if i write like an algorithm which does a hash um table dictionary with frequency from a raw text  
well i mean yeah  
so we can see uh what needs to be supported  
uh sure  
but uh  
um but i don't know if that's really in our field  
okay  
uh <unk> uh that's the other question  
oh  
but uh  
but you can also get the <unk> short time fourier transform uh and keep it right  
then your user interface would be split broken down into more components right which you have a microphone the v. r. and stuff like that  
and so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye  
that's why i wasn't doing it  
i'm a okay  
um the it's right above draw  
mm-hmm  
because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t. v. on the only specific t. v. remote control  
yeah  
it seems like we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip  
well uh  
it just has to be two guys talking in the two bits  
yeah we  
yeah  
we're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training  
'cause it it's not just absorption  
yeah  
yeah  
because i think it's just the optimal what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to  
they're all um  
the the  
<unk> so like cur slightly transparent case so it's yellow like tinted yellow but you can maybe see through it  
congratulations  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh where you really <unk> if you want to <unk> do a good voice speech uh you'll want to get the lower bands correct  
why not  
um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity  
so  
yeah  
it's quite you know relaxed situation  
i don't know how we'd go about combating that  
and all the <unk> uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this  
like building in uh some kind of pin code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels  
what's the seventh is a <unk> a week today i think  
and do you think <unk> informatics would  
about two centimetres okay  
okay  
um circuit boards  
that one is  
is that okay  
like you think directly feeding  
yeah but you don't need anything from me for that 'cause that's already <unk> <unk>  
why  
yeah  
oh okay right  
that's more like it  
i think that's more relevant to a discussion  
but by just looking at the key frames and so on they may say okay  
so it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes for right and left handed people  
trend watching  
so uh it's it's not very sensible at the moment because i'm waiting for the um topic segments or i'm just yeah  
i think the main thing is we look at the costs  
yeah <unk> according to us it's one  
i mean this is kind of a carrier signal but in different domain represented  
uh the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have  
mm-hmm  
yeah something like no d. t. w. or something i don't know i'm not really sure but he mention that  
i'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though  
the meeting uh  
so i'm happy with that  
euro  
yes i yes i think i can  
okay so question number one  
so the speech recognition was are we going for speech recognition  
uh  
both  
oh right  
yeah  
so so i'll is th it like is this and this structurally then always identical  
'cause their parser is probably much faster than anything we've come up with anyway  
yeah in another room yeah  
regular  
you might thinking what the hell was he doing uh  
it's a wave length region but it's tilt but you're saying between that line and that line  
nay that that that's true that's true  
i mean just what  
well i don't uh gonna explain it all because i think you know uh how it works  
yeah  
so i best for for us for me to do that  
yeah yeah  
absorption profiles  
but you have at least uh next produce  
overall score  
next meeting is in  
so uh i think uh when <unk> uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control  
no not  
this is all pretty basic stuff you guys  
mm  
um <unk> as uh for the buttons simple push buttons  
a parent profile and a family profile and otherwise  
<unk>  
um yeah project project documents  
yeah  
yes  
and you know there's just too much raw frame <unk> frame rate stuff coming out of this  
down here interface type  
um we've uh drawn here the <unk> prototype  
so i suppose sometime after you  
you think  
or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere  
elegant  
i will give it a one  
yeah  
uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it  
we have we have to uh fill  
pretty much kept to the company strategy so i would go for a  
said people didn't like  
yeah well it could also possibly be well is it a more real time information base so we can all see which information is available to one another  
the um <unk> was tested last week and initially we were a bit worried because uh in the old version it seemed to interfere with it  
well to be honest if um our uh aim group is uh till forty  
excellent thank you very much  
likely  
okay  
uh let's see if i can get this bloody thing to work  
oops  
no you can't point to it yeah  
i've been doing some research into the different components that we could use um what's available to us <unk> to actually make the remote control  
yeah  
i think one of  
no we won't but that's um something else  
sorry  
ah so but it looks cool  
yeah  
a very good example is google  
oh  
alright  
so is this all we need to get through  
so it's arbitrary  
um we we <unk> we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh <unk> a boring shape and boring colour  
or j. builder  
cool  
okay so um i'm the interface design designer user interface designer sorry  
true  
i guess that's what it says  
like he it doesn't really depend because suppose if you take your <unk> case  
a pro um a product within the budget  
so um  
oh yeah  
so we got some the bad stuff we got remotes are often lost  
uh pen yeah that's  
reading lists before that though so right  
yeah  
but i think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also uh i think it's also good for them  
hmm  
mm  
mm  
like 'cause frequency would be useful i think  
and um but yeah that's  
okay  
okay  
oh right  
did we make it simple for new users  
it takes <unk> know time to learn  
yeah but how will you  
works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so  
i will give a six  
unless you can think of something interesting to do with it  
for example or something like that  
alright  
right  
yeah fine  
no i don't think very true because the colours  
yeah uh no for su for sure because i'm will now type them out  
no it's  
guys  
what's that part  
yeah  
requirements  
and if it's made of like latex that whole idea that's pretty cool  
so the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock  
uh volume  
uh-huh  
and that would allow us to have all the technical innovations  
but  
yeah  
and of <unk> and they also have a time a time information of course  
but yeah  
something from sam's club  
to eat  
but you don't need a battery  
then you can connect this one or this one yeah  
yeah  
like <unk> personally for me at home i've i've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my d. v. d. player and my c. d. player  
oh no it's impossible yeah  
precisely  
well we were above so we did a little redesign  
um interface type um well plastic rather than rubber  
coating and interchangeable  
and then you say right this stream is like i don't know <unk> point two five seconds behind the other one  
little sleek longer  
the buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times when uh the power button is only used one time  
yeah  
yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which i'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control  
yeah  
i think it's impossible  
you know  
the galaxy or galaxy  
that's what i said it's very difficult  
and then you get to the circuit  
then  
we  
right just make some decisions  
and i would have to stay one more  
yeah  
okay  
but it will be embedded on the t. v. and not on the remote control so  
now <unk> oh yeah yeah  
so that's again i don't think you can use them in a combination um especially the titanium i i suspect they're very fixed to a particular need  
but i think that even if it's very subtle we need to kind of trick our consumers  
i like the beep part anyway  
well let's get a product then  
and then the meeting turned up so  
it's very uh  
no  
i mean uh of course partially because they started to buy some more uh more hardware  
and you <unk> and since this this i mean because this <unk> this this spectrum is al has also line spectrum right  
so we don't want histogram or very precise information  
now that would be one button and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button  
mm-hmm  
well yeah yeah yeah  
we can just go for make it a selling point that it is just the basic  
you know that a push button requires a simple chip but a scroll wheel it it me requires okay so we only need a simple chip  
'kay  
can i just draw the face  
that that that would make the significant difference  
speech recognition  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
'cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain  
it might look like clay  
with only one hand  
where where do you stop actually  
and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it and watches yeah  
a. m. i. scenario controller  
no <unk> no scroll wheel  
right  
so initial ideas  
yeah  
uh eva evaluation  
where you can change the face plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things  
alright alright uh now okay  
i agree  
and we got like a rectangle with two like rectangle buttons on it for a mouse  
yeah  
do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular  
then it should have uh on off and uh  
okay  
the screen and stuff like that  
yeah  
do you guys feel like there was room for creativity  
yeah  
and even uh a first uh uh submission using this work um will make things clearer for me uh writing them down and <unk> for it will help i think for that also  
to make it that way yeah  
alright  
remote  
i think it won't be a big problem  
and then even if we don't have many things to to talk about  
okay so our average there five six eight ten eleven  
ex exactly that product um <unk> we'll go yeah we designed that and no one will believe us  
yeah do you think that's part of the name yeah  
yeah  
or does it i mean no it it has to i mean basically the the form of the word is important right  
i think then we we're really losing ease of use  
and it wasn't uh <unk> i think it was a little bit um confused uh last time we spoke about um whether  
no  
oh  
um well okay  
okay almost there  
uh you'll you'll always get some you yeah  
i dunno if they're maybe a little bit more but  
i don't see it yet  
we will put inside the the remote  
um  
hmm  
what the problem is  
uh it's david jordan  
exactly  
oh yeah  
third  
yeah  
um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit  
sure  
mm  
but i would have to study here for that that long time no  
ron  
this is the basic  
yeah  
yeah  
well if you if you have the <unk> l. c. d. screen you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom  
um sorry that'd be considered fancy  
personally i think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle  
hmm  
um that's on the next i th i think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost  
and i think maybe later <unk> yeah we we can start doing simple  
rather irritating thing  
um but i i think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe  
so we're very old fashioned  
some way that we can attach it to a certain time segment  
buttons  
um  
okay i think  
well you see i was i was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus  
yeah but you don't have any button now  
yeah  
uh i'm katie i'm the industrial designer and i'll just be i guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah  
younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more <unk> well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software  
of what we have decided so far  
no it doesn't have line control so  
yeah yeah  
that's good  
doesn't matter  
okay so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content  
okay uh do you know what actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it i think  
yeah  
so <unk> so what was the circular thing that you were  
background colour  
i don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no  
one standard deviation below the mean is zero and one standard deviation above the mean is one or two standard deviations or something  
right  
yeah  
keeping it nice and slick would be important  
yep that's okay  
three  
to um <unk>  
um you have to keep doing the <unk> the the f. n. and f. eight to five minutes to finish thank you a lot for telling me  
okay  
so i put it here  
um okay so uh  
i think an interesting thing is if we don't combine your two scores in the  
um the the case oops that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype  
if it's within our price  
right  
i think is why i wasn't doing it  
oh  
no  
jess  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so um who has the fir do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready  
nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries  
but is it  
uh-huh  
i think  
maybe you  
yeah  
okay  
the ma  
put a leopard print on it  
i think so  
uh rama  
two or three prototypes  
yep  
yeah  
d. v. d. players  
so yeah  
well  
yeah so for channel numbers but  
ah  
yeah  
and i think th  
oh i'm so excited  
kind of  
and um this one is just pointing out  
you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but <unk> okay that that's not really really important  
and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either <unk> the the word files what you uh whatever you want  
okay and at <unk> it's possible there  
and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can what goes on after that  
to make a base or something  
volume going up and down and then mute  
yeah  
mm yeah  
yeah  
no  
because we're making  
especially with younger kids you know they can pick it up and and  
i mean you know i'm <unk> mad  
so if you are then if we are in a frequency th your source looks like this  
i didn't do that yet  
but uh they are not a very big group  
oh uh but this uh marketing designer  
and then well personal preferences i would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the <unk> a t. v. and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the t. v. they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the <unk> coming future um that type of uh applications with  
yeah  
people one speak and people two and people three and you are just uh subtracting the the level that you you kept in the other microphones  
mm-hmm  
kids  
its it's uh ridiculous actually but  
okay  
a stick is <unk> <unk> vulnerable  
i clean that  
uh  
yeah  
they are better yeah  
alright right  
and you could place  
but it would would be uh more expensive  
mm-hmm  
but  
okay  
alright well that's fine then  
yeah <unk> not quite  
and mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next  
so the whole idea with the l. c. d. <unk> and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like quite the thing to go for  
mm  
uh which one is it  
because if we're gonna tell everyone to email p. g. c. then we have to make pretty sure that we can actually access the account and that it's operational and stuff  
one point six one point  
and this is where  
so do you want for example a  
gonna have to swap them round so now it was function f. eight  
but keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh  
okay  
if you touch the button and then it could be it could be lit up as well  
yes  
okay  
mm i it's not true i think  
so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise so  
so  
yeah  
if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really <unk> more technology and so  
that's very important  
you came on wrong day from iran  
kinda this is so this i'm all in a knot now  
alright  
no actually uh to make it with l. c. d. you make more efforts  
have the power wherever somewhere  
um there's there's a booking system right  
the functionality in the future  
we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such  
five minutes  
i would have to side with that i think the voice recognition is simpler  
yes but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques  
i was just wondering where you had the corpus from at the moment  
yeah  
um 'kay we're gonna conclude now has everyone said their functions and 'kay  
then it should be easier to use than any other remote and then if someone wants to you know  
and yeah  
and  
this would be  
ow  
and this is the uh the on off uh <unk> the stand by uh <unk>  
felt like had a lot of charts  
so um so deadlines  
well that's its current application i would presume that it's kind of they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so  
you're erasing  
i'm not sure  
so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that i found  
yeah  
hmm  
i don't think five is be about th three and a half  
yeah that ha um the second one from the top  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah but what's more interesting  
mm-hmm  
wow  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay so here there's for um each segment um uh that's really all segments i mean it's it can be words or topics or um anything i think  
yeah  
i will write that one  
but our marketing range is uh market range is international  
during the  
oh okay  
i think it's five but you don't say  
i think you should punish him  
but yeah by the squeezing it the  
we can just change the code  
um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and i think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be  
yeah because if you on your average um remote if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve  
so there should not be any break  
oh that's a bit of a problem  
repetitive strain injury  
yeah  
buttons  
i i don't understand how those two things are connected  
mm-hmm  
nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some some varnish on  
wait for the marketing director actually so  
i don't know if this one if we see was correctly uh you see  
because the the latent aspects really doesn't have to match the final uh directory category  
so we need two menus kind of thing  
well um when it splits the topics up it does do it on regular words that um that occur  
celebration  
but i guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap it's not gonna need <unk> quality is it  
and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous because it has um strong antlers and uh  
remember you use uh different colours and different pen widths  
was it hard  
no  
finance is um yeah it's  
easy finder with the a whistle function or something or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries  
okay yeah  
yeah because it is the weight will be bit lighter  
thanks guys  
so <unk> actually you're breaking this down into two steps now  
okay  
i got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so <unk> before you all disappear off just  
that one  
mm-hmm  
yes  
no i don't  
no problem  
so we'll have to mix it up make sure we produce enough of everyone  
uh <unk> well it's no no no but what sort of bit rate do you get  
i don't think so because it says amount  
but i guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that  
so uh sorry that was <unk> i think a big diversion  
and on this feature extraction stuff and so at least if you make task simple focus  
which is made of some transistors and amplifiers  
they're not just standard buttons  
well actually dave da dave dave dave  
either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover i'm not sure which which is easier so  
so it it it's like it limited one  
yeah or for example uh what happened for example in one of the meetings is that <unk> people were um <unk> the the results of the previous meeting  
quite obvious very ugly remote  
right  
yeah  
because we're not doing a scroll on the side it's still push button  
i mean we could have well i guess you need an on and off switch  
yeah  
i'm just thinking this is not my department but i i'm not sure what this is gonna cost to be able to <unk>  
yeah  
and uh we calculate so what do we here  
<unk> <unk>  
um was there uh enough room for creativity  
okay  
um  
okay  
i was thinking rubber wasn't special but according to this maybe it is  
yeah  
i i don't remember  
yeah yeah  
uh it's two double a. batteries  
and we've got to think about what that might be  
so but also in terms of providing environmental safe products uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues  
it'd be nice if we had some demos here  
uh topic <unk> topic segments i meant  
mm for both it's the the same innovations  
the logo  
okay  
anyway uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions  
yeah  
this is slog but this is the slogan this is the the the the type  
yeah i <unk> i don't know what to <unk> tell you about <unk> um certain speakers  
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it  
channels that only these children would watch so it's like they <unk> watch you know the c. <unk> or something like that  
blue shifted  
let me one more space  
except if if you are far from the t. v.  
yeah but uh  
okay  
second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion  
so just do normal battery  
okay okay  
wood wood  
you'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh  
and it's gonna look sexy  
is it  
the project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh  
right  
yeah that you could do  
okay then okay good  
yeah just to reading this part yeah  
but you were allowed <unk> creativity  
um or not meet our budget but more um like what kind of uh selling range we'll be looking at  
alright  
it's uh curved in two dimensions  
yeah you can have that as well  
yeah  
but  
yeah perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there  
yes sir  
okay yeah  
yeah  
mm  
um well at the moment it's just a an old file  
uh so let two people share this with uh sort of a yeah a place where we have a sofa maybe and uh and some books  
so  
yeah like when you do this  
an energy source <unk> probably just be uh your regular batteries um we don't wanna have it  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
and i don't think we'd be inviting them  
yeah  
you're waiting on <unk>  
okay what does the interface look like  
so  
might be seat floor rather than person  
i  
yeah  
<unk> yeah  
it's a lot cheaper than doing dialogue act coding in the first place  
okay  
and that's just in the loading stage right  
okay  
mm that's a that's a tricky one certain certainly  
um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um  
right  
mm-hmm  
so then we ca yeah  
okay  
line in  
should we put this back in our rooms or uh  
uh you could see how many buttons there are  
uh-huh  
left or right  
'kay  
so it's completely impossible to do it with full <unk> matrix  
okay  
you just touch the pad yeah  
sorry  
you can have a look at it and  
okay  
um  
so what do you mean by buffering  
cool  
well spongy that's where  
okay  
okay  
um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting i don't know if it was sent round to all of you  
but <unk> <unk> are you arguing not to have anything with object in it though  
yeah  
and it looks like <unk> looks like i'm coming to end of the stuff the stuff list there already  
hmm  
'cause if you don't you won't sell  
how do you want it to do then  
it looks like an uh  
the base frequency of the  
yeah  
yeah okay so that that may work  
ever yeah  
it's a memory yeah  
so  
this will think this will take more time to develop also  
yeah  
um can i just put this on  
ah okay that's good  
uh because after it depends i mean if you give only one key frame per shot after i mean it's one hundred seventy images  
uh i don't know i thought were you gonna use that in the end  
yeah  
but  
i think you might have to disconnect rose  
i think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the l. c. d.  
yeah on a separate menu uh option  
and then <unk> have new ideas about what's needed or about these post analyses you know the and then and we can add 'em in  
so we need the average here so we got  
especially since the younger <unk> obviously the one that's gonna keep growing so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about  
okay  
so um the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life  
oops  
yes  
yeah but  
so there  
mm-hmm  
and you probably don't have time to read all this collaborative <unk> problem solving  
um  
forward  
no vegetables  
sorry  
uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space  
yeah  
you use your <unk>  
i think uh  
the materials for the case the different energy sources the different types of chips  
yeah uh on the other uh on one side i would say yes and the other side i would say no  
uh-huh  
so let's celebrate  
or right okay  
they want these features they want these high technology features  
you know what what we need in the in the <unk> um in the output format for the for the task you know  
not really no  
yep  
electronics  
if we're <unk> trying to keep it  
yeah  
and it should fit the hand  
thank you  
well i <unk>  
celebration  
the the lad has plenty of toys  
next button  
so um weighing those factors  
shall i go back  
it has to be also some somehow  
yeah  
and you could ask things  
yeah  
well young people <unk> li  
um what are we going to do for that  
yeah  
uh ask hynek  
how about names that somebody says the name of somebody and you think who  
'kay  
you're an s. l. p. person  
yeah  
uh  
mm 'kay  
i've put some uh new things in the in the map  
especially when we're all from the same general region  
do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices  
what will be the autonomy  
yeah i <unk> i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these <unk> uh secured areas um  
so we can say low cost uh uh um uh good design beautiful wa da da da da da  
yeah uh a <unk> i think a two  
wow hmm  
in the existing segments file  
you can only re erase  
yeah  
great  
well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually  
so wanna spend some more um i think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually which is good  
ma  
so um you know  
yeah  
your mobile but you when you choose a new mobile you choose the one with voice recognition  
right  
mm  
yeah exactly  
up to  
a specific piece of fruit but just you know like a fruity thing going on  
so so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for d. v. d. player or v. c. r.  
you just have to draw it  
so what we have left on the because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements  
but it it it's a it's a both a <unk>  
lisbon was good um little bit bit mm  
well i'm i'm doing one on segment similarity in the end yeah  
you can  
oh  
uh no  
and also <unk> uh heather you mentioned before um like how it should be accessible to everybody  
i think so  
if we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then  
yeah  
um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one a regular one or an advanced one depending on what our other needs are  
bye  
thank you  
mm-hmm yeah  
mm  
yeah  
'cause the first construct was triangle one and square one okay  
that's funny  
measure it sort of just going by  
um <unk> right so um just to close up i'm not sure how much time i've used mm next time right project manager sorted  
yeah  
yeah  
but then again i <unk> i don't know if this is within our price range or not  
plus five  
right is there  
okay  
yeah  
i like the rubber the stress balls i think you know that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and  
but if anybody  
there has to be a on button on the remote huh  
um and then as far as the way it's shaped we can do standard boring flat  
but uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy  
uh  
um  
mm-hmm  
i mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there  
what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example  
but here you say you want to use i uh <unk> technology  
i mean uh it was last year and uh i think hynek  
it's like a cat so i guess it's a cat  
and okay so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it  
so and you want to be able to  
think that's about it  
um but then across speaker turns you can have things like correction or i didn't see any examples of agree or disagree in s. t. r. s. but i there aren't  
but i'd say what <unk> price are we looking to be able to sell something like that and what <unk> price can we make it for  
well i don't think i have anything more to add at the moment  
right okay  
oh right yeah  
so you get the auto correlation coefficients  
so we can just  
i know it's not really a scroll wheel  
in c. p. u. you mean  
if you want to turn you can't use it and turn  
so you you would train it you this is this is <unk> <unk> all all those links are known  
huh  
it's very true because we designed it to be very fancy so  
<unk> to go  
i don't know whether older people will use it but  
yeah  
and that's just an optional uh device  
right  
yeah  
ah that's for the it's kind of a l. e. d. for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside  
okay  
control  
yeah  
yeah  
tonight i'll try and um i'll either work some more on uh the t. f. i. d. f. <unk> or do the audio thing  
sixteen to twenty five twenty five to thirty five thirty five to forty five something like that  
i don't think the outside would be called as a curve really  
oh okay  
i was gonna choose a dog as well  
i suppose that you can have this  
okay  
so yeah it we just start everything after the <unk> been created  
x. ray b. l.  
which is a pretty basic function that <unk> we've opted out of  
yeah  
hmm  
get it i in the  
hmm  
i haven't used it before but  
problem is this is what pedro immediately said what if you have a page that looks like this  
because uh i mean if you look at the way that p. l. s. a. and all those kind of models have been evaluated  
okay  
okay  
but you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound right  
okay yeah  
you keep losing them  
second criteria new technology  
these days there's a <unk> <unk> things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic you know  
mm  
just design wise  
could be  
mm-hmm  
okay well  
mm  
mm  
with that you could <unk> or a mobile phone or whatever  
<unk> yeah ten or five  
yeah  
why  
so i think  
yeah  
and then uh through a uh transformer  
but i mean <unk> just those whistling clapping key rings you have  
so yeah  
okay and what kind of chip would we need for this guy  
i <unk> i know the only <unk> i mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it <unk> you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability  
mm  
oh what i could do is um work um further with um what i've got now and then just when i have my um um yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
so even if it goes wrong and even if it has a million words be  
okay  
yeah  
one or two  
i'm not sure new ideas found  
but i i figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion  
okay  
it's gonna be your call in a lot of these cases  
that's your part of the job  
here one at the middle and at the  
okay let's go  
nothing related to the database has been disturbed  
mm-hmm  
well if we're gonna do that we should try and store everything in in an x. m. l. format as well  
so who want to start  
uh i see i see  
this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i hadn't time to <unk> <unk> the information yet so  
don't worry about it  
it's  
my pen didn't load um the information  
yeah  
looks weird like like in those hoffmann papers where show you columns with words or things  
the drawing board has to be integrated into <unk> so that you can just easily  
okay five uh  
um today we once again have uh three presentations if i'm right and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts  
it's maybe <unk> you don't need to do the whole uh complicated <unk> but  
that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production  
thank you matthew  
so yeah  
uh  
so i think that can be an <unk> good option  
i looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are  
like could we make a <unk> like could we make a spongy remote  
um well <unk> does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all  
yeah the <unk> at  
um  
i don't think so because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh  
yeah okay  
oh  
mm well even if we kept the regular standard size of remote  
<unk>  
well it could be red  
yes  
yeah  
i mean you know  
uh rather th uh to to to sell for real reactions  
displaying on the l. c. d. screen  
and then in the same display where we display the search results from the search  
to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so  
or you do  
uh so we need to evaluate it um try to do it in a <unk> way and as much as we can  
oh we have so let's move to  
like statement statement reject accept you know something like that  
work harder  
i know we're getting into some i hope some big money on this thing but  
we chose the buttons to be uh teletext okay button favourite channel and the mute  
okay  
smaller without yeah  
no  
i if it if it would be perfect following  
yeah  
it's talking about the species that the emission lines are coming from  
because  
they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium  
or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves  
but but would the information density algorithm still make any sense if you split them up  
i guess something like that where you have to move it around very frequently is <unk>  
transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t. v. <unk> centre which interprets the signal response accordingly changes channel etcetera  
so is why not save that  
oh sure  
oh oh here we go  
hmm  
um  
ah no we have to do all those hours again  
you can have it cheap or you can have it quality pick two of three  
you know a bulb and an infrared bulb so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside  
but  
yeah  
um uh it's <unk> road isn't it  
you <unk> you still  
you uh uh  
i don't know  
too much colour i it uh when you got it in a living room it's too much maybe  
okay  
this you you so did you  
yeah  
oh  
so  
the  
keys and things like that yeah  
well we can <unk> sacrifice more function for a better television remote  
alright  
okay so if you flip the circuit board this is what it looks like  
and <unk> there four hours thirty two minutes  
mm  
so yeah right now i have the feature extraction part where i can get the phoneme <unk> and through the neural net  
yeah  
yeah  
um and uh although i th i th i'm still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that i guess but um we should go for the  
sorry a little bit of <unk> little problem with computer  
no  
now second concept  
oh yeah and that would now be yeah that's that's within the budget  
mm  
okay  
uh let's say excitation signal or that carrier which yeah because broad bands right  
you want a microphone to put in the speech <unk> you don't wan you pay less for the system you see  
okay okay  
oh i did learn something new play doh is useful  
oh  
and then goin following the company motto following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well  
i wonder <unk> which cell do i want  
or well uh to to uh at least the basic  
okay good  
or we can have one or the other  
also  
no  
some little eyes  
well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh  
just to explain uh how  
we should make a  
yep  
this is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for  
<unk> um one below and one above the <unk> the uh the main sort of grip  
yeah  
it's it's also more <unk>  
yeah exactly  
yeah something some code  
the the their collection is much uh uh like they have uh r. t. n. <unk> and all those thing  
okay i like the volume control that's good  
and yeah i think we also thought about combining that measure with um the measures i get from um <unk> uh hot spots and so on  
two four  
but we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the user  
mm  
so the younger audience  
uh no uh personally as a marketing expert i don't believe that because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits  
the front is the most important  
yeah  
what else have we got  
maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap  
shall  
so you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries  
shall we go for single curve just to compromise  
we want a possibility to um to get um  
<unk> yeah  
i suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down which i will do  
back again for another wonderful meeting  
these cables suck  
um well yeah as you already told give some feedback  
yeah the the silver black are our main colours  
yeah sure  
it's not fashion it's new  
yes okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire  
yeah  
yeah as much as possible like but yeah definitely you have to assume some <unk> uh like minimum and maximum sizes of your own  
the whole feature to everything  
excellent leadership  
okay  
um  
let me just tell us so what you know already about uh i don't know how far you are with the <unk> features  
a possibility to get the extra functions  
sorry  
the thing now is to to sell it  
which we don't have yet  
mm-hmm  
oh right  
no it's not  
mm-hmm yes  
<unk> functional requirements or trend watching  
i was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the t. v. unless they've lost theirs  
so then i think i need yeah  
mm-hmm  
are we allowed to leave the meeting now it's started  
so it could be any button that would be pressed  
so i think it's the moment uh for you to really <unk> try to to have a realistic uh date  
kind of like a potato  
is it my laptop  
well i agree with you  
yeah  
and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
the slides the high quality measures we have here we've directly yeah yeah  
yeah but only the the financial parts uh yeah  
yeah black i think is is the standard  
will it be done by then  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
ready for the next slide  
wow  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
so people can can use it without any  
yeah but last time i pressed that key combination everything went wrong and i think i'll be able to do it just fine on the screen  
limited number of buttons  
uh-huh  
also good  
right right  
um  
right  
but i didn't see a clear distinction between these so i think what we have is okay  
okay  
but it's just two and we make a clip  
okay  
yeah  
lithium ion may be a good one but you can replace it with cheaper one again you pay for what you get  
twelve euros not even twelve pounds  
we want to <unk> make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um <unk> across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent  
i draw like i'm in grade five  
hmm  
and i am <unk> the industrial designer  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
you could always insert yeah  
um that would be best but i i would have to look if that  
yeah  
yeah  
of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost  
so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without l. c. d. and without speech recognition  
no  
but  
you can't it's not very uh ni yeah well a lot of documents are yeah  
obvious yeah uh okay that's true  
mm-hmm  
you can reply to the same message  
but if you're really switching between two channels you won't have time uh to <unk> use the other options  
a set command whatever that happened to be  
no no  
yeah we have battery  
and if one of the largest uh or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control  
yeah  
uh-huh  
curved  
we've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly  
we wouldn't you think that if we just write the programme the way that even in the <unk> way that it displays everything it still leaves those out  
huh  
yeah  
yeah  
and i have to write very fast to make the <unk> min minutes  
yep  
yeah  
i mean the <unk> just because like ones that i've been to as well um  
well that's yeah  
it's a ticker tape idea  
uh such as an uh l. c. d. screen uh speech uh acknowledgement as we uh talked about earlier  
i think stop function is very useful  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company  
yeah  
mm  
so chances are they're gonna have some p. h. d. students that uh are interested  
yeah  
<unk>  
yeah  
um i don't actually have any price information no  
like a tracking device or or like a a  
when you move the stick to a to a position maybe uh a light next to it can lit up  
yeah it really does  
<unk> that's fine  
okay  
i know  
yeah  
no hand dynamo  
well we make it more expensive to buy  
yeah she said it was one  
but when it starts up it should just read them from the default place  
but ho hold on  
so that was very i thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody  
uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe  
yeah alright  
yeah but i think <unk> it's really a celebrating object  
but he didn't he ultimately he said it wasn't a problem  
i will that would very nice  
yes  
yeah  
yeah  
um you've got your presentation now is it on the is it  
yep  
well it i mean you can use as many harmonics as you want  
yes  
two  
we sort of have an open policy where if there's no one in there and you want to have a discussion then that's fine  
just to give it some extra special feature and uh i know it will work  
well in in three months  
um  
uh  
so um i will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design first rama then mark and then sammy  
hopefully appear in a wee second  
so we could stay with <unk>  
so these are the criterion uh i'm i thought were important  
yeah  
interesting  
mm uh  
i think so  
a hard to lose is good  
what about you  
mm i think we all know what we need to do now  
which one is it  
no it's our job  
yeah see that would just irritate me  
yeah  
but aurora is  
i just think that it's it's gonna cost more and i'm i'm not sure it's you're gonna use it  
but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design um even if the design kind of changes  
i think controlling is not the right word i think the interactions are very structured  
and uh rate of speech  
i'm not sure  
yeah and that's a problem  
just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection volume control and teletext browsing  
where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and  
<unk>  
yep  
unless this unless this part were raised so say the cover flips over and covers that part  
i think  
yeah that should be out  
also location to identity  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but uh  
because we couldn't we couldn't do something i don't know what  
uh  
so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem  
you can also include clip art  
great  
<unk>  
okay  
and i'm beginning to think that this is quite a good idea 'cause i worry about not doing the stuff people expect of me  
you say the point that if you lose one uh so uh so the thing is that i have to recover means i have to recover through the <unk> no <unk> segment segmentation to <unk> segmentation  
real reactor  
but it's it's better to have in the front this kind of shape because it looks nice  
pen  
we'd have one special colour and one special button form  
great  
maybe i can switch slide uh on your request  
or  
no  
so it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user friendly  
it kinda does make sense doesn't it because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background  
yeah but you um i think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them wouldn't you  
yeah we're to sell two million then  
i think it will be a few minutes and first uh i will tell you something about the findings what i discovered about the remote control  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
i figured that would be best 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one  
so <unk> do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality  
are there enough technology  
uh okay  
yep  
so what the wireless remote control  
so let's go for a small l. c. d.  
but i'm not sure  
then it's a lot faster than the wheel but you've got a lot less control over it  
yeah  
uh  
mm mm-hmm  
yeah you don't get that  
yeah  
when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it  
glad we're not doing this for real  
yeah we can relate it by advertising or  
uh okay so method method of our design i think i just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this  
it's the it's the dynamic regions that uh i think might cause a bit of trouble  
okay  
you <unk> you weren't in paris  
yeah  
here  
so we do one one <unk> yeah  
yeah that's true  
it'll it'll be always at top somewhere at there  
mm-hmm  
um to be evaluated and to be reviewed and to get feedback and come back  
well  
mm-hmm  
maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we <unk> i i thought of i thought of rather than in terms of concepts i thought of it in terms of um like  
and how large is it  
yes  
and this  
uh-huh  
okay so that's a one  
mm  
and this is  
what  
actually yeah we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount yeah  
so we should keep that in mind by uh <unk> <unk> during the development um because uh well those are important numbers  
no it's uh  
mm  
so basic idea is  
um i'll give it a one  
uh uh with big buttons  
screen settings which means brightness colour etcetera zero point five times an hour  
uh the whole idea of this meeting is that it's not me who will be talking all the time  
yeah  
so  
i'm a student but  
<unk> just because um damsel doesn't give you the right sort of representation between speakers  
but i mean my understanding of exchange is is that the initiating move introduces a goal to the discourse  
yes  
and then score yeah it this was just for showing it  
but mm  
yeah well you see each made one we didn't have enough yellow dough  
maybe  
it's not doing any fancy analysis  
that's it's down it's quite close  
we have to delete the the sample sensor i think  
you can't point at something on a spectrum and say that's definitely a <unk> damped lyman alpha some i <unk> and i guess it's because they're <unk> of this source type  
so it's it's probably always gonna be a question of looking at it and saying okay  
to use  
we we were we were thinking about yeah  
so  
yeah but i think actually like at the moment the integration comes first i mean it's sort of at the moment the building the browser comes first  
mm-hmm  
okay  
real reaction future r. c.  
mm possibly  
what is that  
<unk>  
making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do the functionality of it operating all those different things  
yeah  
so some some things i had in my presentation they already told so  
so you just have another <unk> computer more or less you can use but you can use it with your your own mouse and keyboard  
me too  
true  
cover  
uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control  
alright  
it's a great idea  
mm <unk>  
let's do that  
<unk> so then it depends you are to  
i only have one question with the material but i don't have information that  
i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the <unk> slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time  
but you can you can go for that  
'cause i really do have to go  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
we it's not yeah  
that's a number pad  
it's nothing about <unk> yeah  
it can be <unk> no problem  
those really sounds very good  
yep  
yeah  
perfect  
and even if you use uh four microphones to get uh not good  
so speech recognition well l. c. d. it's okay because it's common nowadays to use l. c. d. so i agree on using any kind of l. c. d.  
oh i see  
we have the more advanced menu uh setting right here  
this one was cooler  
it's when we get satellite  
i mean there are thirty relations  
um  
it's a  
so  
yeah  
but those people will be really few no  
i prefer the <unk> i prefer the human touch personally  
because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product  
and then using this uh uh <unk> posterior estimation method to design hierarchical uh speech recognition system which we're which which the goal is to have a better  
cool  
um  
um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set so this quite straightforward  
um <unk> well still some question i have about how to incorporate those ones  
uh yeah  
it's not important anymore  
so i reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber  
yeah it's just information that um like television timetables what's on what's on now what's on next on every channel and  
it'll it won't have teletext  
i shouldn't have done that  
okay  
will have to decide uh  
so you have half an hour to uh think about what you want to present  
and simple  
uh but i mean for instance it should be linked to the other stuff that you've been doing on um call routing for instance  
i dunno  
sort of um  
so you can have a remote control full of buttons a hundreds hundreds of buttons but if you don't use them yeah it's  
so  
okay  
no  
yeah  
well maybe i have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that  
yeah  
um one thing i wa i wanna do is save everything in the right files because i don't think everything is saved  
um whereas the right remote is much simpler it looks much more user friendly  
hmm  
so each remote with a special colour  
oh <unk>  
this is actually the volume up and down but they both say v. on them which when you first look at it  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah i to uh just we need to see uh how well we could work out of the utterance to utterance  
mm mm mm  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's right  
yeah  
yeah okay okay um  
<unk> that is yeah  
well how do i know what it replaces  
especially gamma full models i have  
alright  
it's one word  
um a mute  
four  
yeah  
okay thanks  
yeah okay  
i know it's weird  
yeah <unk> and it depends what application you are using it for  
people are not there to talk very loud but they can sit and relax and uh still look at at the mountains  
and this is false this is just like  
alright so <unk> <unk> if if if we're <unk> if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback  
alright  
mm-hmm  
yes  
yeah yeah if the meeting's over then yeah i guess so  
okay  
yeah you know and then you just <unk> i mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly  
yeah  
we can just extend it to any device  
well uh will there be some uh user requirements later on  
and i have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end  
so what would give us your ne your design would be the lights would be on top right  
no one else can read that sorry  
probably plastic  
so  
yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends  
dumped the data  
length  
cut some of the prices that way  
but same part in different colours yeah  
for <unk> or whatever else like all those <unk> and transformations  
you'd yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah <unk> that's so true  
so the flash get allows you to hand <unk> them later if you need to by stripping extra video off the front  
no we don't have any <unk> tags like they use  
yeah yeah yeah  
that's worth thinking about  
or not  
but it looks really not really good  
um  
so you you can select only the links which are within the article or within the categories or it's it's it's well structured it's it's uh easy to manipulate and  
i see  
yeah  
yeah it's there like i used to find bus numbers from book only  
isn't hard to lose  
i mean if it's a simple chip then we suddenly got two euros and thirty cents  
well  
which it is uh i think  
mm-hmm  
that's what figured out  
i don't know how to call it  
and play doh  
okay  
yeah  
oh  
this'll take forever  
something that would be different uh separate it from the other remotes out on the market  
no okay  
right  
four  
for example as there are not um f. zero values for every speaker or on sometimes not for every meeting um how will i count that up  
yeah because i mean if even looking at <unk> right now those trends the smaller the hotter it is yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and what we  
so don't change case  
so not to be focused on  
mm  
one for like cost and the one with like higher end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them  
so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it  
okay  
but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these l. c. d. screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices i suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions <unk> different functions on the screen at different times  
it shouldn't be highlighted  
i mean obviously there are gonna be ca  
and my family guy d. v. d. <unk> but we don't need to write that one down  
very good  
yeah  
um the biggest user frustrations as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere  
so  
but would that not happen at some sorry i'm <unk> jumping in  
okay  
make it more appealing to guys  
so you might see it's is more less like a line  
so we're going for <unk> okay  
yeah  
sorry  
these are already in use  
it'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording  
yeah  
i mean it's it's it's you you're almost assured it's only gonna be a single speaker on the microphone  
it's okay  
so uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also <unk> as an icon  
well i dunno i i guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are maybe  
so we could say that was our target  
it turns into a duck and starts <unk>  
okay  
why did you pick square  
'kay  
yeah i know her  
it's diffuse  
but is just to know in the sense that really uh this <unk> this mm thing has been stop now for quite a long time  
ah  
something like that  
it's like double r.  
he is the whatever  
um again i'd say this this is a physical process not a <unk> feature  
because then we could do <unk> and and <unk> probably in the same scale  
what do you think  
so that's the thing we uh discussed  
it  
yeah i guess  
so perhaps we should we should focus on that l. c. d. screen  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
right  
god forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective very always dependable  
okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines  
yeah well <unk> well let's just start  
um yeah so what we ended up with  
um as opposed to a functional look and feel is our number one priority  
so let's move uh let's move on  
and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance  
mm-hmm  
we can't just replace the word by an arbitrary string  
yeah  
project  
and um  
hmm  
they're not going to be as  
i think we did pretty well as team work though  
huh  
and if there was conversation in the room at the same time although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television  
wait what i <unk> got in mind  
was was able to  
yeah yeah yeah so uh um what so <unk> what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery  
but it's  
okay  
so basically we've got andre and nancy at the top  
yeah so you're right  
okay  
yeah i mean mine are only more but they have the same start and end point  
but uh shall we make a basic remote control uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more  
what was it problem  
but  
so like you have to have them somewhere 'cause you're gonna <unk> need those special functions occasionally  
could i just could i just jump in and suggest something quickly  
i wouldn't but you would  
no as in the height but what about the width  
but like you know if we get more complicated then it's gonna <unk> be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size  
okay  
yeah mm  
yes  
uh  
okay  
yeah  
and the second one is for the software  
so i could uh can uh um use that in the in the report  
don't worry  
so now it's  
yeah records and stuff like that  
so there's no way to like predict what our 'cause we had a we originally had a  
so most people want to have a a remote for their hi <unk> and t. v. and stuff like that  
we just wanna make sure that we've taken into account yep  
okay  
and i know from experience at some point you also get negligent  
yeah uh  
we may not need it  
i usually <unk> crap it's one thing to do you know set up a party with your friends you know  
channel up and down  
yeah  
so um all the remote controls must have our um we'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way  
t. v. and v. c. r. and this needs a needs a advanced chip  
that's great thank you very much for that <unk>  
so um i've been here for fourteen month i think  
hmm  
yep  
redesign our uh  
um uh another option i saw was to drop the buttons one through nine  
mm-hmm  
uh first we have a prototype presentation by g. and g.  
well i i i think especially in terms of growth i think this would be a very smart group to target  
to change covers  
mm  
that is true yes  
yeah  
okay  
aye i see what you mean yeah  
right  
mm-hmm  
which is the same um parser as the redwoods tree bank was made with that alex talked about yesterday  
so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh that means on my own i yeah it should be  
mm-hmm  
right  
but you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control  
your index finger is channel up middle finger is channel down ring finger is volume up your pinkie is volume down  
uh mainly th there would be some experiment to check how the system is robust against these uh tuning factors like uh language mod uh language <unk>  
yeah  
yep  
we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button and l. c. d. display or multiple <unk> wheels  
but i was hearing stuff but i <unk> there was nothing on my wave form  
it doesn't matter 'cause all the <unk> done off line  
what size battery and  
but we haven't done for the whole thing  
that didn't help me too much but you can use this little slide bar to adjust the resolution  
so you can cluster those  
i'll take it to different i <unk> i don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down  
yeah  
we don't got the button supplements  
but i'll i'll i better i'll i'll remind her yeah i'll i'll i'll do that  
oh yeah  
okay ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh  
rubber material  
and the <unk>  
yeah i think it's it's easy for that where are you but then it says i'm here  
uh for that we will use um uh  
next point  
mm  
um your individual assignments are for  
yeah  
so what exactly we are looking at is this like the front of the remote  
and hopefully i hope next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could  
yeah  
but you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and so you'll <unk> probably find yourself turning the volume down considerably  
it can't be curved  
if the <unk> on reasonable power they always seem to work fairly well  
yeah  
but it may be a bad idea  
so  
but yeah  
so cost like production cost is twelve fifty but selling price is is that wholesale or retail  
mm yeah  
but  
mm  
um  
oh really  
but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look  
i mean so and uh so i mean this is uh this is one of the issue as well  
yeah  
so you know just <unk> looking at what what craig um craig's i uh ideas are <unk> <unk> tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this  
if you go down  
yes  
right well i i i think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you  
yeah it's true but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost  
yeah you just concatenate them together  
yeah okay  
well if if sarah's keen on a spongy feel  
mm  
purely feel is is is very good is very good in your hand so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel  
are we going for a special colour at all  
yeah  
or maybe something is uh maybe there's something <unk> in in these  
'cause uh i haven't been i haven't read the <unk> in my email since i left  
yeah  
yeah  
i was thinking titanium i was thinking it's just i have been influenced by pictures of <unk> and they're also minimalist and shiny  
uh i think it has to be on the on the solar energy but i don't know  
okay  
so it's uh speech coding  
uh i will open them slowly no  
so i think we can <unk>  
'kay  
if not more yeah  
yeah  
right  
so it's not too bad  
well it's all to see how you know how the participants were furthering their tasks  
if he wants to pop in for five minutes the the windows machine is free for him at the moment  
damp lyman  
okay  
i would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the l. c. display 'cause it's about what really separates us  
no they said people are talking about tasks you know  
mm  
not so much  
but um so they'll they'll uh they'll tell us something about that  
we're  
we could colour co <unk> them li  
yeah  
not everybody  
okay  
well that's the thing if it's gonna take more than like an hour or something it's not worth it  
and lighting a on his office  
oh well never mind  
project documents  
again you get your three <unk> to see what you came up with  
now this is the simple version  
very good  
well we can uh erase an animal i guess  
if we have only one button  
try give the user these pieces of paper to get an idea of what these topics are that's this p. of w. given z.  
mm  
okay  
that's the lock button has a l. l. on it and then the m. is a mute button  
what was your last conclusion on that one  
i'd say that  
'cause it also like in english it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might  
that's just i mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a  
uh  
if we want to uh integrate information to say these people has uh spoken seventy percent of the time in the five last minutes  
uh i think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in english uh  
and so the <unk> then you have uh predictor is fitting actually this compress signal  
exactly  
uh <unk> yes i will just add something  
okay  
yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas i mean  
uh i i think it wouldn't as it occurs i mean it would be it occurs in every meeting  
has anybody pressed okay it vibrates  
aw should be nice in your  
and there was something else they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons  
mm  
sure  
mm  
yeah  
and so mm-hmm  
okay for some strange re reason i had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh  
okay  
okay  
hmm  
i dunno actually  
i would say i would agree with you on the colour because that's an extra option  
mm  
um you guys worked together well as a team  
i have some kind of pictures  
but  
yeah  
two function buttons and the l. c. d. just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum  
no  
i think the <unk>  
and the functionality of the  
physical  
um  
yeah okay  
we we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy  
like those p. l. p. and m. f. c. c. <unk> because everybody knows that di it worked somehow right for any kind of data  
so you know there have to be these other scripts that add any um data transforms um not data format transform forms but data transforms  
okay  
so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition  
the remote that knows you  
but all  
oh good point  
okay  
sixteen  
but that's what i want out in the end  
so we can have that lot let's just throw it together and do what we can  
okay  
i think that's true  
to keep you informed  
it's okay  
i'll put it online  
change case colour  
mm-hmm  
but um how much time did we get for this meeting  
<unk> violent t. v.  
<unk> oh we do we do  
and that pretty much sums it up  
and true is one  
exactly  
yep  
i go to ninety nine  
yeah  
maybe not  
yeah but if you have the near the l. c. d. you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio  
remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume  
um  
it's not quite a scroll wheel but  
yeah  
<unk>  
yeah  
right  
<unk> some kind of be i've never seen that before and you make it uh um be uh you see it with uh the mo the <unk> nowadays  
so  
what do you mean every sequence of the same  
um so i'm making sure that i can take get that information out of the g. d. f. as it <unk> state of the moment  
but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more  
mm-hmm  
so that that solves the whole mute issue  
i thought the uh the <unk> the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
is it  
ah ha  
and then yeah i could easily make it throw out three different dialogue acts  
hmm  
oh wait somebody <unk> <unk> somebody explain that slowly to me  
well we could also use a battery that's a bit  
okay  
easy to use  
okay  
yeah yeah <unk> yeah i i i'm looking for parametric yeah scheme  
mm  
you need <unk> more things  
i mean that's just something that isn't tested so far  
a and i'm <unk>  
right okay um  
and we'll turn to the next presentation  
we don't want them to look like a calculator  
okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or  
mm-hmm  
well you've already got that  
yeah hmm  
i guess you could keep it then  
yeah  
um this is fashionable  
it it might be 'cause that's our corporate colour isn't it  
um so we want something to keep it from getting lost  
okay uh my name is uh danny <unk>  
can you find it as a j. peg  
yeah and if if we  
so you can't see the alarm but it would light up  
so there's load of ideas that i had about this uh in that if you can tell that two topic distributions are close to each other  
but of course uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of  
basically out  
okay  
well i mean there's also the cachet that um uh the japanese make great products  
but um  
something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit  
all right  
it's not  
okay  
mm  
something special to our uh remote control and it's possible but it only cost a bit more  
it's for the lighting yeah  
so that's not cool either  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
yeah i know this we are <unk> <unk> talking about today short term if you want  
mm-hmm  
there maybe we can see  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah tap it on the desk yeah  
uh uh yeah  
mm 'kay  
yeah but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that you know  
yeah i have one too okay  
i think it's very easy to i would say seven  
oh yeah  
these are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of <unk> what people would pay more for a certain feature  
just a little group group decision application  
yeah exactly  
i would say to  
so three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic  
okay well this meeting is officially over  
ah i see okay  
i yeah  
i don't know just think okay that's that's a good idea we'll keep it  
what i was thinking is whether if we replace the word by something uniquely id identifiable then it wouldn't make a different which order it is  
um so uh for different person this might be quite different  
yeah you would never you would never lose this one yeah  
okay  
and if that is our <unk> uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls  
mm  
yeah  
um that's not um i'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice  
oh  
yeah something like that  
and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa  
should it  
you it  
okay  
it we can make it yeah no  
so anyway it's just just an idea  
plus red  
so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas any um  
you're our project manager  
and the other  
uh if it if it if it's wireless i could just uh put it in the  
<unk> i i got um or or three things basically um relating to the remote being only for t. v.  
or because it size is going to be that yeah  
it's fruit  
no  
yeah  
yeah  
we have to think about um space in living rooms too like 'cause they're i mean would you put it on top of the t. v.  
so we're having very very few buttons involved but navigation around a menu for most things  
yep  
okay  
we have that one  
ah the bleep we'll find  
we'll call it e. f. um do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow  
line yeah we took blanketing out so i don't think that should be in  
okay so  
question i'm working on  
something important about a <unk> uh no uh which <unk> uh should remind us of the remote itself i guess  
is two two third  
and then maybe you'd need some sort of correction to um to correct minor phase <unk> at some point in time  
i already talked about the cameras and microphones but they are not of uh much use to us  
okay here it comes  
kinetic powered remote control  
plastic  
okay the uh th this looks better  
so that's uh that close your investigations  
that doesn't really look like him actually  
that's a bit uh much  
yep  
uh uh uh  
like i said uh use one button for instance for <unk> multiple functions  
it going  
all it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one  
um  
with uh  
this or something  
yeah twelve  
so  
no like  
yeah  
can you all <unk> <unk> mail me your <unk> mail addresses  
yeah but i li i like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons <unk> buttons so  
no that that that seemed like a novel idea as <unk> as far as i know  
and writing text uh yeah you've gotta really do your best to write some  
yeah but okay  
see  
mm-hmm  
the global usage so if people don't have the technology  
whereas if you do um fancy things with it you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that  
that's no problem  
so <unk>  
ah okay  
things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things  
hmm  
and the biggest problem currently is that the carrier is actually not <unk> but uh something little bit more uh uh interesting  
so so things like fixation the number of <unk> a and  
i mean i the meeting actions is just gonna be a segmentation  
you like the rubber uh <unk>  
so um  
yeah  
yeah and <unk> and and we uh need <unk> and what is this  
i think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one  
you wanna play with that over there  
we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly definitely  
oh so we do yeah  
and you know it's easy when i go back over i normally <unk> like go back to the beginning  
uh so then then  
and uh basically you can look to the standards of other  
real reaction  
right right  
hmm  
so you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh but i think it was a very uh very good uh session uh gentlemen  
is  
sorry  
mm  
just the l. c. d.  
you know in the end it this is gonna li i mean we're gonna present it and say yeah so this our it shows disagreements  
so it could be <unk> a few centimetres  
yeah  
c. a. t. h.  
but the point is that the z. the the the aspect like the z. are are are come <unk>  
so uh yeah  
i don't uh hear a bell  
not the summaries  
i think i ha  
mm-hmm  
hey yeah i said ninja homer  
but you only started here  
yes  
mm  
or is it okay to <unk> make it be kind of this spare space that gets used up a little bit when you need when you have some extra visitors or things like that  
yes  
mm  
i'm not sure how how we'll <unk> uh determine the costs i will have a look at it  
yeah  
uh  
yeah yeah  
okay also  
yeah  
yeah  
uh it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what i already said  
so uh and that was a project i suspect similar to this  
uh  
yep  
yeah more like that  
okay  
and uh if we want something fancier i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice but i don't know if it's worth the cost  
i mean the shape is trendy  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
no then uh there will be only one conference in three years or something for speech because  
right  
i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy i'd say maybe aesthetic  
cause uh i must say i find it slightly surprising given that you know mobile phones incorporate voice activated <unk>  
um i'm not sure how how that  
not a lot thankfully to say  
all the similar segments in uh across meetings and separating by uh some things like  
okay uh that's probably it  
th  
i had some problem with the pen i think but minus your <unk>  
if the remote control would look fancy  
have to think about the question you know 'cause it's i think that you know you can always you know  
yeah buttons and strawberries  
um simple designs like the last one we just saw not too many buttons and as raj pointed out  
mm  
i guess our i guess our main um  
but if they're whatever it is that one is looking at if the other's looking the same place they're in good shape  
and then across turns she used damsel right  
mm maybe  
so we know you know somebody will have gone and by hand and sort of marked up <unk> something <unk> like shallow <unk> kinds of things right  
mm  
when you use titanium silver is fancy but when you use silver rubber it isn't fancy  
thank god  
okay  
okay so this is very it's a bird i think  
um i can't think of anything off the <unk> top of my head but there are certainly things that you buy  
um that would are willing to pay extra  
mm  
ah  
if somebody wants to buy it they can have it otherwise no  
but what about home directories or he also kept everything in uh temp  
um and yeah the reason i like whales is 'cause uh they're well first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious  
and one of the things they will want to know is an event series after some critical event right  
yeah  
didn't somebody say that actually like a lot of agreements have have actual words which should suggest disagreement like  
yeah  
yep  
it's <unk>  
it's quite modern actually  
okay well we can do some user test with scroll wheels right  
they can go block by block and look into it and try to recover but um that matthew will want to go or not is the question  
um and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report  
advanced  
uh-huh  
mm  
right because it's sort of like it's just a time window  
um  
the what  
good  
hmm  
so  
mm  
yeah the <unk> <unk> video  
uh yeah i dunno  
and the advanced we'd have to go with a l. c. d. <unk> display  
i'm getting a bit uh specific here  
and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and um  
uh i think usefulness is <unk> as as i rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than <unk>  
and um well it should work uh i've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of <unk>  
yeah  
people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on  
oh pity  
or  
um would be an awful lot of these would be like what  
well <unk> uh let's do that  
and i know all your names again courtney <unk> and amber  
uh we're <unk> using kinetic yeah  
because a <unk> yeah smart minute is all the process of capturing the minutes automatically  
mm  
true  
um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing  
flat spectrum radio <unk>  
mm-hmm  
thirteen point seven  
uh in the same colour as the side  
um the components of a remote control are of course uh the case  
feel free to ask any questions or comments obviously  
oh  
or a you know  
rubber which is good for this r. s. a. and then uh titanium  
how much it will cost and  
you you got a wind dynamo yeah  
so  
uh oh  
right <unk> right exactly exactly  
oh no  
and um um areas you see that uh could be improved in your experience with them  
but maybe a door that you can you can <unk> remove or <unk> have on would be good  
yeah but it ha doesn't has the digits  
you only have one yeah  
well maybe yeah you could when that's when it's too costly you could probably skip the <unk>  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yes that's it  
uh below i believe  
it's a frog  
but if there is no no if they cannot recover they they will send it back  
that would  
okay  
yeah  
millions  
i  
um  
so before you're applying uh power spectrum  
yeah true  
mm  
or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day  
okay  
um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating <unk> of the user  
i don't think that will sell very well  
i <unk> something like that  
maybe we should do the design evaluation first  
uh we go back on the decisions later  
it's quite cheap actually  
enable us to complete the project in time  
oh  
it's like the news  
mm yeah  
if you said the <unk> dat  
that's where they are  
examples  
is it the  
well maybe a two because of the menu button or something  
no no  
yeah  
we're no we're deciding now so  
sure  
mm  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design  
but <unk>  
okay  
yeah i mean if it's just for one meeting it's really not too big  
isn't oh those are just regular buttons  
yeah just use oh there tho uh there's no <unk> there's no <unk> pads  
so you may not be uh  
so i had a bad uh  
like a double curved in rubber um you know each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options  
if motorola or nokia gets hold of this uh tape then we are in trouble  
and you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something  
that's trendy  
moment  
so  
we put the fashion in electronics  
that's scary yeah  
yeah i'll say two  
mm-hmm  
cool  
and they're a special material  
yeah  
okay  
i think if we go with the um design plate thing we'll have to  
um <unk> another new development is a scroll button which was also th also already mentioned  
no  
well the laptops if you have them out front of you you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation  
by accident  
hmm  
yeah or there's gonna be something  
<unk>  
i mean  
yeah  
i i think we have to fill in a questionnaire again but  
well i personally did not have that but  
but i don't see yet where it's written down that you can't mark nebula  
cost  
but it might <unk> i think it might not really be worth it to be honest  
yeah i don't have any other questions on this  
okay  
but it was very no innovative <unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t. v. apparatus or stereo  
your name is name  
what will be the topic of my thesis the subject of my thesis  
okay that gives us twelve point seven  
so so let's see what what else you've got  
so yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside  
i don't  
but for the utterances i've just got one meeting so far  
mm-hmm  
so what is the compression factor we are getting here  
uh f. eight  
mm-hmm  
but then i'm not fashionable so  
mm-hmm  
uh yes  
yeah  
it's it's more an instantaneous um this is still instantaneous  
to email yeah  
a wind up  
yeah  
play doh won't last very long <unk> go like oops it's gone  
hmm  
moving somewhere else or is more likely to be uh  
mm  
right  
yeah yeah yeah  
and uh <unk> did you do something with evaluation criteria  
<unk> we will uh we are thinking about the visual grammar meaning that when we have an interaction event that is uh fired  
what's your talk  
so uh you can get pitch rate of speech  
so like in my opinion the for now at least the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so i'm gonna say it's like a three  
it's over  
yeah  
nice to meet you poppy  
but we can only really judge that once we have sound files  
<unk> the actual thing might be smaller  
well he's <unk> he's physically here  
a design is basically for industrial design and the user interface  
yeah  
i would do the arrows here kind of thing  
i <unk> the mail but you don't  
yep  
the remote control is easy to use  
i see  
so  
yeah  
good  
yeah  
so  
speak change speak change would be yeah  
i like the appeal of it being like a big <unk> in your hand  
okay  
maybe because uh there's there's some <unk> uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that  
and we could maybe think about using speech <unk> recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room  
it's too much integrated in the other  
you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout  
you can do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff  
you can understand very well  
but again two times less important as the technologically <unk> of the remote control  
wait th that's the second point  
so uh i think we have decided on the things that uh from janus the energy the combination between battery and kinetic  
no  
okay it works  
fairly enough  
shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after  
mm-hmm  
right um as we remember i opened the meeting the four of us were present the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved  
we have no idea  
so that's a definite one  
i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly  
mm-hmm  
and um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on  
rank each of the following things and then i'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that  
yeah  
and then it switches on  
so maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves  
i don't know about powerful  
yeah  
so  
in which case they are usually words which tell you quite a lot or a very general word which usually doesn't tell you quite a lot  
yeah sure  
in a word uh document  
yeah  
yeah  
i i probably get instruction on that how to do that so i make another presentation i guess  
or uh or <unk> or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh  
no  
'kay  
five minutes before the meeting's over  
we then have  
so over any one second they eye's actually <unk> fixing on a bunch of different things  
yeah  
um well i use <unk>  
um  
okay  
<unk>  
yeah  
so you got email  
no  
yeah  
right  
that would be like a mid class um yeah  
just  
uh the concept is okay but it has to be quicker  
why do you think it's better at the bottom  
mm mm  
so this is too expensive  
okay so th um so that really means that we're not throwing away absolute <unk>  
it's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway  
yeah okay  
on screen display  
you can just reuse that because the name is the same  
okay so we could have keys that are like a <unk> like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them  
yes  
yeah but <unk> what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this if you have an object  
how am i doing  
actually  
hmm  
hmm  
well it yeah uh there's nothing i think it's pretty basic  
you take your remote control with you  
no no  
success  
um  
rubber  
it's pear i guess  
mm-hmm  
it's  
yeah  
what do you guys think  
so she likes uh buttons which make click so it has to click  
because even i suppose even with the ball  
i um is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber  
you know using that kind of theory at some point  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
the l. c. d.  
yeah  
yeah  
or several segments for each category  
maybe maybe we can go to to your presentation uh matthew  
black all black  
alright  
process  
i sorry  
did you get the same thing  
mm-hmm  
oh right  
but like especially if they're sparse probably individual named entities which describe what a what a segment is about would probably be quite good  
what about things like the clock and um timers  
the mood of persons the fashions uh  
we didn't use the <unk> at all  
yeah i looked up on was uh the l. c. d. displays  
i'm pretty excited  
i mean i  
then i'll move this one  
well with that achieved our last slide is our closing slide  
okay  
yeah  
like some soft green or something  
what what do you think craig  
mm-hmm  
but  
how they and so this is important  
speaking about robustness if if somebody has an accent that you can only really understand what they're saying due to world knowledge yeah it what they say  
yeah if you're really lonely it is it's  
okay  
it means cool features like  
it's the most straightforward  
'cause you know i if you're <unk> told use the booking system  
if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process  
international  
textured feel we just talked about  
that's my opinion  
<unk>  
i'm not a designer  
but ho hopefully it will run smoothly and yeah i can relax  
i can't write  
it's it's yellow  
oh yeah  
well just with the with the flexible plastic uh  
so i i <unk> i will uh put it on a story board  
yes  
yeah my name is name  
no i i don't move my uh my remote control very much seriously  
so well we have sin one curve a design  
mm  
yeah  
uh i i didn't got it  
mm  
mm see  
it sounds quite reasonable nine megabyte  
yes  
yeah  
just something else than than black or white i think  
look  
okay  
<unk> but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to  
so our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well <unk> not exactly the details  
just do it on the arrow  
just long  
yea uh so <unk> actually you could make an l. c. d. screen but no mic or it could make mic but no l. c. d. screen when you look at that  
we should really maybe we can do that together at some point today that we check out how the player works  
it was it <unk> it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first and i'm total t. v. new anyway  
yeah that seems reasonable  
mm-hmm  
because i think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions  
no no you don't have to <unk> no it's uh when you when you stop <unk> uh when you stop the  
and then um look for cases of mis transcription  
and <unk> um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost large buttons for the essential functions  
there's <unk> it also depends on the country  
which haven't really been used much on remotes so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert  
sorry  
mm-hmm  
i don't really know  
um i'm just gonna have a little <unk> presentation for us for our kick off meeting  
whistle tracking  
so he has things like you know adopt um so basically it's to  
i think it's gonna be too much  
yeah  
for this meeting  
mm  
send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes  
and well the recognition it depends on you guys  
uh i thought about uh the l. c. d. touch screen which is uh is easy to clean too  
yeah  
yeah  
and then yeah  
so that's <unk> uh different  
who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding  
so it's it was a problem with the time code  
but  
okay  
i don't have  
it's the entire screen is just running information at random  
yeah  
and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that  
no i've no idea  
well sometimes it's very difficult so focus usually there is no problem  
uh pretty accurate  
like that  
mm-hmm  
yep  
i dunno maybe that's an idea  
t. v. at the lounge the <unk> room separate  
but i guess if you're picking out a <unk> feature even with a broad band or narrow band then it's still a <unk> feat feature  
mm  
uh not uh scale <unk>  
no  
the bit it often goes missing especially with children  
um  
so it looks like  
how long is the meeting  
oh that's it's very ambitious yeah um  
yes volume and programme should be there i guess because you hands <unk> uh <unk> your hands will be in the smaller part  
i thought it was a process and that it it wasn't included  
as long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour  
mm  
just about  
okay  
it's not really true  
so  
mm  
um solar cell is interesting  
if you use traditional controller you have to put a button but now you don't have to put button you have you just turn the turn the ball  
i think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that  
yeah  
yeah this one yeah he's getting some improvement <unk> uh this is a yeah  
i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough  
i think speech recognition was  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
um  
yeah  
safe uh <unk> uh safe assessment  
right  
but i mean if you're fro from two  
ellen might be more persuasive  
yeah there's there's always a  
it <unk> if it's not a fashion  
okay  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i'll rub the features and let the drawing stay  
the icons on the arrows as well you mean  
would you like to make any comments about next uh  
alright  
mm  
the mm yeah  
like i don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves a fifteen year old you know  
so <unk> you cut it out  
yeah okay okay true  
and uh for the others it will random  
so you can squeeze in it and sorry  
<unk> 'cause any sort of error in that in that line is is transmitted is <unk> in a net as a phase error right  
and then is it the integrated or is it  
which which scripts  
um i think we could because the l. c. d. panel requires power and the l. c. d. is a form of a light so that  
'cause i would need something that marks the end of uh of uh is is yours segmented by topics then that like is there any information that you have to the topic  
okay  
energy we've decided on kinetic right  
that's it  
it's a nice beard  
yeah  
uh  
uh-huh  
or should we  
reaction real reaction  
most buttons are not used any more like you said teletext is outdated now  
so i made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the <unk> requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings  
yeah um  
so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use because it relates to the overall image of the company  
it could also work with uh with the stereo because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing  
probably  
yeah  
and just a last thing  
mm mm  
okay  
uh  
yeah  
well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you <unk> your television yeah  
well you know <unk> like some special feature  
right  
it's like a very simple uh paint application  
it was about the working of the remote control  
uh i'm done  
and and you  
at the back yeah  
obviously we need to uh to know that it's the same people  
oh no  
so basically the um i'm just gonna just recap uh what i said at the start  
yeah  
yeah  
ooh  
uh no not too much i think  
the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative  
and one full day a week  
no no no no the in the the gap to find the the good number of clusters is so sensitive uh  
uh okay that's it for me  
latino  
yeah  
um i agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun <unk> to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right  
yeah  
what you see here is is the basic part  
yeah sure <unk>  
no no no  
so what are we going to do  
yeah yeah  
something like that in the yeah  
so it's so uh so the main idea is like first to take the some some window  
um so i will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation  
yeah  
um  
because uh  
mm  
hmm but like this  
yeah that's the <unk> yeah i don't know  
mm  
is it easy to use  
yeah that  
uh well uh  
they're actually just plastic that's textured kind of a little bit like  
and uh i <unk> what you said to us  
<unk> <unk> shouldn't we integrate it  
and here again  
that's the easiest way  
mm-hmm  
or here  
well i wouldn't bother to mark all of those instances though  
true  
uh <unk> so if <unk> okay  
most uh  
um this is um i'll just go over your head if that's okay  
no but you have titanium of course  
yeah th it's a yeah  
yeah why don't you just <unk> i think just clip on clip do you have a belt  
well that  
so we believe in providing international market with fashionable products  
apart from the the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape memory alloy  
i mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once  
yeah  
yeah  
yep and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a d. v. d. player  
um is very good  
i'll rub that out  
good  
mm-hmm  
indeed  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic a rubber latex type thing uh wood or titanium  
there  
so  
thank you  
if it's defined by a <unk> feature we should mark it  
they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat i've got six remote controls for a stereo system  
yeah that's for things marked with and  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah right  
oh i don't know how that got there  
one domain yeah  
how these questions may have been worded and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology <unk> <unk> ease of use is necessarily the right ranking  
yeah  
um anyway yeah this is what we're gonna do afterwards  
yeah  
yeah but without any extremes like <unk> not of this size not too large  
mm-hmm  
yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore and i think that's one of the things we wanna keep  
twelve fifty  
or combine uh both with a with one uh  
by just making like it <unk> read write for everyone  
because i think it when when there <unk> was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source  
so he's coming  
mm  
mm  
the rest  
no  
this one's <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
that's the thing with trends  
true yeah <unk> more more environmentally friendly  
so i'll i'll go for four  
very fun  
when we can down to it  
yeah  
that sounds pretty good yeah  
yeah  
yes  
uh  
yeah  
that's the digital panel  
whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that  
well i <unk>  
do you have any data on how much um different prints cost  
yeah  
well we can work around that um  
yeah  
we have <unk> yeah yeah  
under the shared folder i don't know it might not even be under yours as well  
mm ye  
it's not quite that they just get harder  
hot  
at which point if  
yeah  
might be difficult  
hmm  
yeah but not r. and r. yellow i think  
yeah here we can see that yeah  
i can probably just implement like a five line java hash table frequency dictionary builder and see  
mm-hmm  
okay  
more complicated design that <unk> uh sorry raj um  
well it is to us because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine  
but that uh we'll discuss later  
like at in the experts view you have a lot of more buttons  
design enter  
mm  
seven is false  
how should they how should we implement that  
okay now for the really interesting stuff the interface  
okay  
but it <unk> it might <unk> but it might sound crazy in the player  
then check the speech regions  
that's me  
mm-hmm  
the sample speaker is two <unk> wait <unk> <unk> four points  
uh  
very handy to know  
and the sound  
a bit more  
and the we we can decide decide between th those designs  
um  
okay  
now there is simple ways of doing tool tips over a given element like if you have a button and you just give it a tool tip text  
mm-hmm  
um and the good thing about claire sending it is she's probably got a psych email address as well and it it might look a bit more relevant to them  
yeah  
yeah yeah definitely  
cheap  
yeah  
okay  
yeah stuff  
right  
so i find it quite hard to believe to be honest  
kick it out  
it's okay  
and then  
and it it <unk> linger on every time you see it  
mm  
but you the see that in the v.  
yes definitely definitely  
you have to pay  
eh both of you you know  
and maybe we wanna make it something that's <unk> to do other tasks  
so i think we can we're okay  
we're one big happy family now  
and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the t. v. to the right channel  
because they don't have anything to do with what you see  
okay thanks  
okay  
kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones you have a page button and it goes could we do something like that  
yes 'cause we've got to think of the instructions and sort of basic introduction to it all as well  
mm  
yeah sorry  
from top to bottom  
oh true or false  
that should be there minutes  
yeah i mean it's already got a kind of cool shape so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out  
so um i dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both  
yeah <unk> will be back and he's not in vacation but he's in italy  
yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights  
at the side or something like that  
the good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra red  
yeah  
yeah i mean we can process it in chunks if it gets too big basically  
dash  
check with the <unk> r. and d. department the capability of <unk>  
and so i did a little research and unfortunately all i had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before  
mm  
but generally speaking we've kept the other attributes to the  
right  
uh-huh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
uh-huh  
in itself  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
true  
yeah  
i'm not sure  
okay  
i'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens you know  
ooh  
but uh  
conference thing haven't they  
i mean it it it reaches a different market uh  
mm  
is it just the t. v. or do we want to in  
the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had  
because it cost nothing  
yeah  
um slow repeat program mute and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of <unk> one example  
it should be light okay  
uh-huh  
um oh beta yep  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i hadn't thought about the i was assuming we'd just get one and one licence both of us  
so you have to come up with a components concept yeah  
so what they say on the side is put fashion there  
oh it's a little bit  
mm i'm not really sure what i want  
in trendy things  
yeah  
yeah <unk>  
um this is a rabbit  
yeah  
uh i just  
and overall in general it looks like it's coming up to par  
sure  
but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been maybe just in the way that we we use it  
things like um um  
yeah except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so  
well <unk> marking up exchange structure if if it's there and if um if you've got a working scheme for it is relatively cheap  
well we are a design team we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point  
be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that  
yeah  
do we have to <unk> adapt it  
um  
a smaller device that actually fits into the big one  
uh for turn turn the ball  
no we don't use an electrical cable  
yeah  
and then there is a training uh with m. l. p. that's taking some context of these p. l. p. coefficients  
yeah you can't  
yeah  
looks like a <unk> look likes a a <unk> a tropical fruit  
it's it's fully featured everything you might possibly want to do is there you know it's got forward  
so we should take that in consideration  
mm-hmm  
and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of <unk> the the the team member so  
okay so i think i will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh  
uh i'll i'll do a search  
yeah  
you know if you're suddenly evaluating against chunks that were done using h. p. s. g. i don't know about grammar but it you know it  
the only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons  
and i'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well  
on the coffee table and then people would always know where it was  
th think about the button as well  
yeah  
then it's okay  
doesn't look great does it  
hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now  
oh um doesn't oh  
'cause i don't  
we can go through  
that's true yeah that's also  
<unk>  
we wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway so i mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation  
i've never seen it before in a remote control  
right  
mm-hmm  
it was my first <unk> paper ever  
yeah  
you could say all of that is damped lyman alpha  
it's uh <unk> the <unk> so i it's the working design  
when you <unk> how do you zap  
so  
are we supposed to say nice things about jen now  
uh four point two  
yeah  
i am sure that we could do that  
to <unk> your own remote control  
concept  
um  
yeah think uh also in between  
yeah but we would <unk> ma we'd do it in taiwan and so it's not gonna be that <unk>  
i think as i discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing  
i mean or twice in the morning once in the afternoon  
yeah but then you have to choose the this always with <unk> universal remotes you have to choose the code  
uh i don't have any personal <unk> uh preferences uh so far except for uh the materials to be used uh light that they are light  
okay  
mm  
the only problem would be if but you know  
okay  
that to have such a system wouldn't require a six months of work because basically their own code is there to some extent and uh the i. v. c. is something quite standard from which we could ask i mean even we could even pay maybe pro some people from <unk>  
i see right  
although teletext may become outdated <unk> there's no <unk> logic in not having it in there anyway  
um and  
i'm number four  
yep  
etcetera  
okay  
yeah  
but  
well  
okay  
and kind of let it work in to get ideas about  
mm yeah yeah  
back to the uh the cost the material  
as in five six you know number where where the <unk> yeah well i yeah  
so there's no this uh look and feel thing though that's not a technological innovation  
i mean it depends what sort of business you're in i guess  
yeah  
you know i it could be you know if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device i mean  
just with the environment is a difficult thing  
you can imagine it in the water  
yeah or <unk> special form  
yeah maybe  
yeah  
i don't know  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and it is something that is not just saying i'm going to do uh this this this and that  
very good  
um  
so something like this  
yeah  
yeah  
did you work well together in there and 'kay  
but it's becoming out dated now because of the internet  
so what i'll do is i'll copy it  
so well i mean  
mm yes  
mm  
it was a big issue but  
and otherwise no sweat you're happy  
hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote  
uh these lapel <unk> are trouble  
you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken it's the inside  
yes that's true  
banana  
well this is just the working design um  
yeah  
i think everything has it for and i guess  
but we already have the scroll wheels the <unk> uh the speaker uh the speak recognition the rubber  
yeah  
oh so even if we know what that word means we're not supposed to right  
and if uh also a finding but not very <unk> applicable here that sports and gaming devices such as uh  
there are a few buttons connected  
uh well yeah i i read something about it but  
could it talk back  
yeah that  
yeah yeah  
sure  
yeah we don't know but that's uh that's that's that's more market research  
maybe later on  
mm  
so you're just doing the face  
especially when there's many buttons and it's a you know a <unk> a a <unk> interface  
so uh i noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling  
i did the same thing  
that's uh that's true  
<unk>  
continuum i think should be in aren't they  
so i also <unk> hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other  
ah  
that may or may not be a good thing  
you know  
is he integrated  
mm  
i think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own  
yeah  
no  
yes  
still opened or uh  
no  
um i'm not sure that's sincerely correct  
and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user  
the <unk> i i don't think one one one aspect or one latent topic has any sense by his own  
so the labelled one okay  
mm  
but right yeah  
okay okay  
yeah  
so  
yeah  
i mean a although it does seem uh interesting  
and you both agree for that  
next slide please  
okay  
and uh the <unk> is uh useful but the the pen is i uh not user friendly i think  
well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah  
so mm  
uh yes  
mm-hmm  
oh it looks like paint actually  
scroll down you'll see <unk> all the files  
mm  
uh this for <unk>  
so  
because yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical  
but with the same thing i mean  
<unk> it's banana vision  
um  
i think we shouldn't have too many <unk> for my part  
which is what i'll <unk> plan to use that as the basis for it  
mm-hmm  
yeah but that that's just the same as the the led  
fruits kids  
uh one on each one on each side  
yeah  
these are just thoughts  
mm-hmm  
then you  
so we can have a look at the working design first from participant two  
titanium coloured plastic  
yeah i mean sort of taking upon that idea  
well <unk> i don't know  
mm-hmm  
so here  
yeah this is the easy stuff  
yeah yeah  
so  
um for ex um i i compared it with what i did for the pause um duration extraction  
um know that if you are changing the menu structure here um  
so do we know the difference between um we broke it and it went away and um it's now part of the construct  
so  
right  
i'm uh i'm just curious do the like the <unk> meetings do they have anything other than the audio  
electronics simple chip advanced chip right  
okay  
so first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple  
<unk> to the remote  
yeah  
okay brilliant  
mm i suppose it should depend on the length of the segment  
cats don't really like me so i can't like them  
so do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us  
yeah yeah yeah  
oh no th that's what that's what i thought but maybe maybe it doesn't  
a certain phrase  
right  
page rank of z.  
and uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes i hope uh we can end this meeting  
i know  
mm-hmm  
so let's not use the <unk> any more  
no i think that's not if you go to control panel  
no  
you know it would have like fruit and <unk> is that we actually make these spongy  
yeah just galaxies  
alright  
'kay  
th th those two have yeah they have to be large  
it's definitely  
i had to do this really fast  
one is most  
yeah  
yeah  
so apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market  
yes i think  
well and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still <unk> through menu options in <unk>  
no like i said we have a <unk> hybrid kind of thing so it's not gonna charge the battery it's just  
or suggestions  
okay okay  
but right  
yeah  
th this is the base  
alright see you all soon  
and uh what you get is a messier version of the argument structure because not everybody has the same argument in their brain you know for this  
uh uh mm  
mm  
interface industrial  
so  
project evaluation  
or emission from h. beta is is a process  
uh we found in order of importance people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool  
that was that  
so the  
but um i just worked um i mean i just calculated the values values for um the average f. zeros and um they're what's <unk> i mean i didn't have a look at the data yet  
uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now  
<unk> we've we've gotta find a balance of course  
so you know it might be that we only get say fifteen anyway  
yeah  
although it does still have a battery so i'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that  
yeah  
huh  
like with the data structures i'm just like over these vague ideas of some trees i'm <unk>  
yeah but we want to make uh the wood colours uh that uh  
wow  
which goes goes out through there  
but what we need to know is like at what stage in the eye tracking stuff where it does that and whether that gets through so that um craig gets it automatically in what he's translating or to g. d. f.  
is that the value or is that the word  
yeah  
okay  
um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design  
okay let's say that seven is the best  
um  
and uh we know that when we put a computer in front of them uh it doesn't help focusing on collaboration  
but it's no worse than any of the other <unk> remote controls we have  
yeah i'll just i'll just keep it there  
something like black and red  
and um then in the chunks of text i found looking for word patterns and so on  
yeah  
i think if <unk> if we market it as as not as not well this you <unk> you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing <unk> schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool  
no  
okay yep  
yeah does  
as the previous meeting i will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision  
welcome at the functional design meeting again presented by <unk>  
chip senses the connection chip produces a morse code infra red signal specific to that button  
there's my dog  
yeah if we build rocket ships why can't we build left handed and right handed uh remotes  
yeah  
tall  
okay  
now it's coming computer no signal  
yeah  
yeah that's it  
'cause you you know you're sort of you're <unk> it  
so  
you could keep your sample sensor and you'd be looking to take out point two  
uh they'll get a shock of their life  
and i thought we said that in the meeting before we wrote the report  
but this idea of the kinetic that you don't have to replace and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work  
so there will be some circuit uh for the power  
and it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes  
uh  
it is isn't it  
no six  
yeah  
it's no it it's useless  
so it could be that if they only they hadn't had a blink just then they would've been i don't know what  
i'm thinking if we go for say  
uh for this i'm not uh i i don't know the solution but one solution can be something like putting uh <unk> password or something inside the wave  
so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote  
cool  
okay so i'm the first one  
so let's  
hmm  
yeah it's better  
yeah  
we <unk> oh not quite have the scroll wheel unfortunately  
well that's excellent  
uh-huh  
yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want  
mm-hmm  
uh i'll write down glow in the dark  
no no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something  
it's not an easy field to to play you know  
maybe it can have more components you know different remotes  
yeah that's true maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good t. v. remote and have it be um  
right  
yeah  
the interface specification what people um how they interact with it basically i think  
and if i am a german then i would like to have the my options in german  
alright  
and  
like th if you have pistol you have it so  
so  
so we have to look on this  
yeah i'm going there now  
divided by four is two point five  
suggestions that you may have so far a um your personal experiences with remote controls  
just put back my laptop  
okay cool  
and there won't be any crazy scores anymore  
yeah  
yeah we'll come  
spongy  
the plastic is is the colour you want it  
thanks  
mm  
but but how does how does the remote uh report uh <unk> uh give back to the user <unk> in what state it is  
yeah  
um so i'm gonna <unk> basically i've got a the <unk> <unk> the base the basis for uh um ascii to g. d. f. converter  
mm  
we have some connection and here we have some input  
uh  
suppose technically we should have two because it'll be two machines  
yep  
so at some point he was using all the available memory by any mistake you know  
yep  
yeah  
think like vanilla and banana would  
<unk> okay so i'll show you the the two prototypes  
so um i'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo but i'm going <unk> i'm not going to  
they <unk> they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume so it's easier for them  
yeah alright  
yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy  
yeah  
so uh let's well so this is a speech  
not a lot for us  
so um no presentation for me  
you don't you don't need me involved in the pilot do you  
um one hundred respondents were involved  
okay thank you  
you don't have to hurry we've got plenty of time  
did you plug in the power cable when you come back  
and the meeting actions are meant to <unk> uh become more um semantic and more theoretical than the kind <unk> have traditionally used  
mm yeah  
because the on off also goes you know like on off like power not on off sound  
yeah uh i mean it's just a question i wanted to raise  
uh i <unk> just uh a question on the the organisation of the m. m. m.  
yes our your favourite  
okay  
um  
mm  
i i think we will be finished this uh  
yeah  
<unk> my favourite animal is my own dog at home  
yeah  
yeah  
i  
yeah  
and but then i <unk> i would  
mm-hmm  
she's not here next week anyway  
it is pretty curvy  
okay so they have too much  
um  
i  
mm  
right  
oh okay  
i mean maybe it's too much  
okay  
mm-hmm  
maybe some less  
see you  
um uh the lab has been block booked again  
mm  
yeah yeah  
mm  
yeah  
uh  
i in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a <unk>  
are there only any other <unk>  
uh i think for for the current uh proposal i think that it's just for distinguish between dialogues and monologues  
okay  
unless <unk>  
i know  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
well maybe a little bit expensive  
yes  
so um i i will uh i will so i we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email i think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent  
yeah  
you have to do different things and you know you can't necessarily  
on the sides  
and um we got an email uh from i think it's the the research department  
that they only use ten percent the buttons  
oh <unk> uh oh still oh it's gonna get more expensive with  
i know i think at the very start of today i like wrote a whole load of stuff  
well i have it here  
yeah  
yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations  
mm-hmm  
but i think these segments are perhaps not exactly what we are looking at because that's just <unk> one tying all the others together  
yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah <unk> i have <unk> the screen functions if you know what i mean  
so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable or whatever they like  
but yeah  
and otherwise no matter how may buttons we have we're gonna have like you know  
yeah i'd like push buttons with  
so uh basically uh well  
so uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours  
mm-hmm  
but but for for example v. c. r. that's better example in this case  
i don't think you really need absolutely to do that  
right  
yeah it's done just yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i got this mail  
to improve on the design  
i mean <unk> computers is going to  
uh channel settings so for programming uh your channels in in the right order  
kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed  
okay  
i is it if if this is from the side <unk>  
yeah  
for example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support and what are <unk> <unk> features of uh current and future televisions  
yeah  
you lose information  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
okay okay okay okay  
yeah i think i i think that's i think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment  
and then you can use your thumb  
that i <unk> i thought that would be under yours  
put it back at the charge  
okay so good guys so see you for next uh successful project  
and  
quite what uh no what uh he was doing he was using it for speech recognition  
oh man  
yeah yeah  
yeah a three  
yeah  
uh-huh  
and the third thing is it should be easy to use  
using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti r. s. i. you can as you squeeze it you are not only <unk> yourself  
yeah  
mm yeah  
you know i think i mean if it <unk> if we get a major television manufacturer to say <unk> oh yeah we'll have that  
because because uh of the quality of the the  
right  
to a power  
desktop project documents  
um <unk> we've given her two person office for two reasons one is because there's a spare place there  
so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together  
okay  
we got a really good market expert  
programming them can be a right pain  
yeah  
yeah for drawings  
yeah  
any other questions or can we have the lunch  
and us yeah yeah so these measures are a way to quantify that  
it just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day  
uh it was bruno right  
yeah we just put a good battery it it  
mm-hmm  
yeah my husband's at home with the baby  
did you get the little buzz buzz  
and then amplitude  
yeah  
um  
like the priority is exactly the pipe line order right  
and you find yours like you said saying the same thing over and over and over  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there the room  
it's always better than making too much compression to start with and then being out of unable to go back or yeah  
you have to 'kay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
um so  
oh  
<unk>  
hmm  
oh yeah and it's easy enough to dump stuff into an into separate track  
there you go  
and um i would say ignoring <unk> ignoring power for the moment  
it's hot i mean it's a mango come on  
mm-hmm  
simply to the segmentation information or  
but in the traditional controller how do how can you control the scale  
no maybe not  
so i will say two  
the wheel doesn't work  
you're kidding  
programming part  
that's what i say  
uh  
i think for us it's just like a normal <unk> but they'll be recording what we write down  
that marker smells really bad  
because  
the base  
uh it's quite decent  
so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back  
so  
yes  
yep  
okay  
you just use the control button uh  
have to remember it  
the the thing with the the round with the four  
mm mm-hmm probably  
but the turns were actually quite short which one would it be  
yeah  
just connect it my kingdom  
well why don't we do it like a mouse then  
let's get started  
but i think that's pretty much what you're gonna do right  
uh so it's uh wireless technology  
mm well my my personal view is uh <unk> when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it  
ah  
which maybe doesn't get used as often  
see this would be good  
adjusting  
but but yet i understood that the market is different  
it's the functional requirements  
yeah that's true  
uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions  
well it is quite it is quite quirky i think  
alright given that information  
mm-hmm  
that doesn't go in and that's okay  
so if you want to have a bigger stuff so <unk> would be kind of very small with lots of <unk> in links  
<unk>  
uh i'll i'll come to that in a second point  
yeah the the fashion do  
ye  
sure  
yeah  
that was good  
uh-huh  
okay  
yellow  
um and try and <unk> um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on  
and it's just page rank is just a simple algorithm for doing this over the whole big network  
yeah definitely  
it speaks for itself  
it's kinetic reserve  
<unk> um i'm quite happy to to to do that i it's good when you do uh something that there is someone using it  
you  
uh that's that's too complicated  
yes  
and this is  
well they lay there all the time  
hmm  
is it fancy enough  
and then it measures um which words are typical for a certain <unk> category  
well it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow  
yeah  
entirely explained  
yeah sure we hmm  
four i think  
<unk> do you want to start  
yes it's  
well the rubber push buttons  
yeah okay  
yeah but i made  
okay  
yeah uh  
mm-hmm  
ye i i think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option  
okay  
<unk> about fifty euros  
yeah  
yeah  
but  
oh okay okay  
like this or like this  
uh well the sub component i suppose that you understand what a sub component is is <unk> in this example it's the button  
okay  
yeah i guess but uh i mean most votes count right  
well then the residue will be very low  
a battery  
most of them  
but rubber  
yeah  
<unk> left top or right uh top  
we can try to to ask  
mm  
presentation is exactly in two weeks  
um and the case it's more of a single curved case i guess would be that be the general  
mm  
uh-huh  
ooh  
uh line emitting gas i don't like yeah  
in  
how important it could be  
right  
when i view image when i say view image  
but yeah but it's more towards industry no  
and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button  
it's hard to know  
oh no no no i was <unk> i was saying <unk> just give them a bit longer to get back with the title  
one  
well titanium <unk> i was saying that titanium if we're being restricted then  
i th i think so yeah  
but we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea 'cause it's the most of the <unk> the <unk>  
uh that's what rainbow does  
f. f. t. is only a tool  
um did you wanna comment craig  
it would be relevant to like the overall goal i think so  
we need a straightforward interface like ian was saying simple not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra red signal  
hey  
four  
i <unk> i mm  
don't tell me it was a feature  
yeah we can take it from there  
two  
mm-hmm  
you can go down of course  
the utterances  
we got a couple innovative i  
i believe so  
mm yes  
okay  
yeah  
i didn't know  
but then again people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda so maybe maybe we  
or  
so i think there's no hard clustering  
oh man five minutes  
no but  
mm  
the cost would be le reduced  
mm-hmm  
television uh itself uh  
after five minutes uh  
and in marketing  
project process  
it no you can do that  
yeah  
oh everybody is not ready  
you're welcome  
next  
so it has to be uh a modern design  
like as a backup for something  
so we probably we don't even have to change the utterance document  
um the first one is a standard battery  
twelve and a half  
so i think it's important to keep um that in mind  
yeah it depends but  
not any p. four or whatever because it's safe it has been working for twenty years  
what should i draw  
to have something new and so we i think we should still thinking about it  
because just few few days back i took a backup of my laptop fearing the same thing  
um could you maybe draw something  
yeah i used it to <unk> to yeah it did work pretty well  
and after we ha we have an an average and uh we see  
so um what else is important before you run  
so we  
we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um  
would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal  
well for <unk> martin if you didn't mind working with martin we can switch nancy and martin here  
well is it maybe there's another possibility  
and maybe we can all think about it  
and you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger  
yeah  
yeah  
okay no no problem  
it's gonna need some th th thought of how we  
yeah  
i'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size  
oh okay  
you want the  
oh sorry  
okay  
this is a residual for me  
right  
okay  
so uh um i mean i <unk> <unk> for slightly different well no i mean it's if you you  
okay but uh think about that kind of things  
the yellow uh rubber telephone  
very nice  
so we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis  
mm  
so frustrating  
yes  
is everyone here  
up to three but don't exaggerate yeah  
it should be  
so yeah for interactivity this is a very weak definition yeah  
um  
oh  
uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices a set of buttons for special navigation in space  
so i guess this is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it  
you can sell for twenty seven and a half  
what what overall things have we not decided on  
i i am  
um  
your  
yeah and we <unk> we better also like have in the representational list of par like even in the n. x. t. up translation a list of parts  
yeah  
what's the use for that  
um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again  
mm-hmm  
yeah 'cause they're pretty and just like  
well nah  
yeah it's funny for a week  
that would be our case  
um well the interface type supplements  
fifty cents for one single stupid button  
i mean that would drop whatever is below or above  
yes  
yeah i think that's the better one because  
cool  
hmm  
i'm the marketing expert  
that should be the design basically  
uh-huh  
and <unk> to  
no but i i i think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
if you look at this  
i think so  
maybe maybe later maybe we can uh  
you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation  
uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button  
<unk> yeah it's safe  
yeah  
strange  
uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie  
voila  
yeah i understand  
yeah  
in <unk> these we can consider what what things what's good about them  
because when we don't need a <unk> a docking station then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip  
yep  
for example this page there's no text in it will set it very low in user information for the links  
it's not  
and then  
it's  
<unk> that's a one i think that's definitely a one  
good call  
but no they need a they need an account on this machine to actually to use it  
anything else  
okay  
if you look closely you can see  
yeah that should actually be fine especially in the worst case we just introduce a small hour glass  
um what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project specifically the <unk>  
mm-hmm  
well i actually did um  
yeah but more like twenty minutes or more like an hour  
now is to  
okay  
yep  
but  
yeah and then if you the maximum is sixty millisecond frame for him  
<unk> oh i see okay  
two  
so so essentially there's there's um a. e. is divided into t. r. one and c. and other stuff okay where c. is the construct the existing thing  
right have you you tried cold calling her  
something like this  
yeah okay  
it was them just <unk> uh forgetting to um define an attribute they had to  
yeah  
we are busy with something  
no  
that's fine  
yes you have to  
uh the <unk> the screen is okay but the board uh that's the problem  
so like you say tactile might be better because it'd be more available to everybody  
in the market uh  
yeah  
yeah it's like um yeah it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it  
no no  
yeah  
you know  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
a and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object  
yeah  
just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results  
um  
yeah that makes sense so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra  
but uh i <unk> i don't understand some way exactly  
i don't know  
yeah but for i'm just wondering for the whole thing  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
you know so on a scale of one to ten how important is that and  
four  
basic  
mm-hmm  
um okay cool e. okay  
let's keep flux in because it in most of these cases we've put flux in  
voila cool  
okay  
tap  
alex was showing um yesterday well without knowing the head word of the utterance at the leaf  
um uh no  
if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important  
mm-hmm  
thank you  
we could just sign up an uh remote if we liked  
and uh with the kayak you have one problems you don't have the real media so this is another thing  
anyway last <unk> last <unk> what discussed last time you all remember that that we have to keep the electronics size in mind  
um  
what which which do we suspect we should hold <unk> we should hold on to  
yeah  
no just kidding  
um for technologically innovative we've talked about the tracking device  
okay that's what we decided earlier on  
yeah  
hmm  
and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic  
obviously  
uh uh that's the other yeah  
so it would give the buttons here  
uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work once again uh thirty minutes  
no but  
yeah yeah yeah  
um this is the  
no when <unk>  
yeah  
which one  
yeah exactly  
i think it depends on the function  
yeah  
yeah  
sorry  
but uh well thank you very much for your co operation and i had a very nice day so far  
but this interface are kind of confusing  
uh  
if there is backup  
<unk>  
uh yeah  
yeah  
is it easy to get lost  
yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's t. v. and you can just walk away you don't have to be near the t. v. at all  
'kay  
yeah yeah  
the mono stereo option  
so the more topics you have the more th they're sort of squeezing into the space of what things can be about uh and things are kinda pushed out  
mm 'kay  
then you have or you have to cut this off  
and we say everything uh yeah  
yeah  
uh  
right  
nah  
yeah  
try to press oh okay yep  
right okay  
so it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no that's  
okay  
even easier to use then  
so uh we have to uh start winding up  
yeah  
the energy source would be a battery simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere  
yeah something like that yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it bounces back from the floor where you throw it  
okay so i've got something on the twenty eighth  
okay  
the plus thing needs to be worked on  
okay  
yeah  
um i like dogs because they're very loyal  
but so the so the real <unk> the real question then would come in  
and that it is altering the spectrum isn't it  
um thing i love about edinburgh  
yeah  
the fact that there's one word tells you about what would be the next word  
it's your rat  
shall we save the point two for profitability then  
so that the the a the ends and the  
yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now  
but <unk> uh the phase no you <unk> it's a phase or you can encode it like a carrier  
mm  
yeah  
yeah true one  
what was <unk> your one  
but may maybe we could go more directly i don't know  
um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the  
v. l. b. i. network image  
okay thank you peter  
so maybe anna you can have your presentation  
yeah  
then then you don't necessarily wanna do it  
uh  
and the diva it was uh something different  
it's three days  
you just apply some those uh triangular windows or something like that in order to to get a li really like just fifteen bands right  
okay  
complex  
oh a way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product  
<unk> <unk> sorry  
line width  
wait like like this uh a bit  
than the cost you gave the sixteen euros  
remote control will be bought by  
no  
so our big questions here really are  
where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device which is quite a ni a nice and neat one  
a digital box a d. v. d. player a video player and t. v.  
i think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well  
they are as as much as ultra luminous galaxies are  
you can for example if you use another array uh you can intersect lines of direction  
so i think it's worth its price  
yeah  
<unk> could we put it here to make it as straight as possible  
when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t. v. so yeah of course we haven't actually got a working model yet  
okay  
so only words and words and times  
next  
yeah  
he got bored  
yeah  
yeah but i mean because it's not like it's a pen you know left handed people can't normally write right handed  
yes so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment and the way of communicating with these equipments  
and we'll yeah <unk> let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several <unk> um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen  
okay  
we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features  
it seems like it should be more around two  
it's like uh it's a very  
can also mix these  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
so just average the score of those items so  
yeah you maybe you have some international standards where you know if you can use one is the other are or almost the same so the sign  
i wanna make sure everybody's okay with that  
okay well we have a single curve which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good  
you never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the t. v. you are asked the the command the t. v. com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
yeah  
then teletext is useless for them i think yeah  
if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things  
mm-hmm  
i is there a matter for a new remote control  
oh dear  
lot more modern  
i think that's very innovative for a remote control  
a yeah that's all from me  
yeah  
yeah  
because i think even if something has large buttons as long as they are not <unk> large like even technically  
mm  
are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television  
i mean i we  
the other the other two uh frustrations are far more important  
but if you put push the the menu button  
so we if we have an an event yeah that that yeah the second line then for the second before it  
um  
yeah  
your thumb might get a little bit uh  
okay that's it  
yay  
yeah  
or they can design their own cover  
there were six true or ones four um pardon me  
um something like this shape you know  
so maybe two  
but i have now  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
we didn't sign one  
yeah  
then it's  
we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read  
mm-hmm  
for other task it can be uh it can be uh helpful  
okay so the number pad is 'kay great  
but you will be here until almost until end of uh  
right  
then what he says you know the way he <unk> words sounds nothing at all like it it should be  
it has to be different and familiar at the same time  
we will <unk> we use titanium  
um  
i think we're gonna have to skip the rubber  
but practically it's not  
and looking on the budget not too expensive uh material  
yeah so  
i've <unk> i've been saying everything's the new black  
mm-hmm  
just disconnect it from whatever it's doing and then have that set the length of the summary or something like that  
yeah  
what the <unk> and the  
okay it it works like this  
yeah i mean that's what i'm already doing with my <unk> uh separate  
so  
yeah i guess so  
um  
i think  
i think we needed a larger budget  
oh i haven't had a look yet yep  
it's for the t. v.  
um if we are i mean most of the uh  
so you can't use the theory  
a logo  
uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here  
uh what is the place uh the the central i mean where we change the bus to yeah in the yeah maybe you can check the booklet  
i think you all <unk> basically have an idea what's involved  
that's fine  
something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore  
because because the the range where you can use it is fair  
fancy as fancy as the one on the l. c. d. maybe even better  
so do you think  
i mean ho <unk> <unk> <unk> are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use  
i killed the four  
one we'll try and get done today yeah get get windows back on there  
mm  
mm-hmm  
three three  
so if we're if we're aiming to make this an international university universally accepted product um and for all the other thing is like age market  
yeah  
your part  
and it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit a chip  
and just make it red now  
i'll i'll i'll just add uh uh i put a big summary here so we could discuss it a bit  
uh  
but what do you think  
uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used well very much but it's it is still used  
on uh yeah one battery  
and just to have uh an idea do you think you as the  
okay so can we close that  
<unk> yeah  
how it would play out yeah  
yeah i'm quite keen to do like most of that  
uh solar power will <unk> also not be a good idea because then they have to keep <unk> their mobiles outside in solar energy  
well uh what i <unk> propose is that uh you know a remote controller i it could be a cube  
'cause it was sixteen buttons wasn't it that were  
oops  
for any object you measure you use for uh a reconstructed signal and uh  
oh where would you like to put it  
the pitch was really good i thought  
yeah  
yeah  
mm go  
yeah  
no i yeah  
yeah then you go one down one up  
yeah i think so  
and then if you plot them on the screen where where they are at the moment they seem to <unk>  
yeah  
alright  
there you go  
yeah yeah  
i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the rolls royce of remote controls basically  
yeah  
um on off  
yeah  
what <unk> uh <unk> what did you think about the <unk>  
which buttons are wanted uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable  
we can we can <unk> we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it  
have to take this away also  
okay  
i kinda like your  
well  
yeah a little bit  
uh right so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal  
production costs  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
so this will be t. f. t.  
and you have to speak the so that it can understand  
sorry what's the yellow one in the middle i forgot  
okay  
<unk>  
where the logo is and if we have the replaceable section it's like the top  
i don't know we have to ask these question  
uh i think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order  
so  
and then <unk> all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around  
um and then we need to  
so we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to  
the  
i don't know  
here you compress the the th this th this i the what <unk> yeah of d. c. t. of of the signal right  
um okay and i thought i would just quickly show some of them that i found  
yeah  
what's this one on the side  
'cause i've not been sure if there's an if the <unk> been cutting everything off  
it's a giraffe  
yeah think so  
but you're our marketing expert  
uh you just want to know in in which corner of the table uh speech is coming and not uh which person produced the speech so  
uh <unk> solid yeah  
maybe uh we can go a th matthew's presentation because  
yeah but what i mean is i i i i i if i if i put the same video with the same name instead of this one  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah i am sort of <unk> uh just the fruit does me in i mean uh it might  
is it  
not on remote control  
we had line blanketing just now and we included it  
sorry  
maybe that's why it's it's not working because it's more  
yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing i think  
if we can get stuff like that it might be a good idea  
technologically innovative  
so um  
i mean if it's in <unk> and they know it's foreign does that matter  
but this this isn't a <unk> yeah  
yeah okay but uh at the moment uh teletext is  
the most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay <unk> alright  
uh  
like it doesn't have to be you know <unk> that was just an idea  
thank you  
right  
so  
right  
functions  
they don't support the team working together you know they're still very individual tools  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no absolute numbers but it's just more expensive and takes more room i suppose in your in your design  
format  
i mean <unk> some people actually are stick very carefully  
it depends if we like if we are concentrating on like a fruit design  
and numbers and uh that every culture in uh yeah people in every country can <unk>  
yep  
mm-hmm  
well at the moment from the dump file it's just got them uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh so if if we can have the the three presentations again please and uh um <unk> perhaps you'd like to start uh <unk>  
my executive uh big room with the with the panting  
th th yeah  
'cause i think the reason they're long is yeah  
uh  
i think  
there are little um uh sensors so do not grab it here but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end  
to a sequence something like morse code as you know uh with a different sequence for each key  
mm-hmm  
well if it's a trendy original um aspect we're going for  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
no but that's that's okay  
if it's a really small t. v. maybe  
interesting  
i re i know you i i i i i get the idea you really like it you know  
okay  
yeah  
i am busy with the end report right now  
yeah  
and we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is maybe you know  
why  
alright  
and the buttons obviously are rubber  
okay  
no  
gotta plug you in  
no  
scuba that's an instrument  
it yeah i mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different  
um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six  
so that's the most important things  
then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts and finally we'll close  
ah okay yeah yeah yeah  
um  
that's a great elk  
um  
batteries  
there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included so there was no we could be like yeah it has it included  
i th  
mm  
yeah  
well the <unk> the average prices i think that this technology will cost i dunno around eight euros so  
it's plastic  
we yeah  
so did you  
uh colour  
yeah  
yes  
i'm not quite so what it did you want to do it i you just wanted to assign  
and um yeah it wants to look fancy fancy look and feel  
we'll give them a special form  
uh  
yeah  
oh  
well we obstructed you with that  
uh is that uh are there restriction for the range the operating range too  
yeah  
so um  
um  
okay well this is it  
twelve euro twelve euro fifty  
one of us  
then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want  
now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand  
yeah and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of  
mm-hmm  
and then lastly it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include  
would make a <unk> study <unk> one point eights  
um and a spongy feel  
mm-hmm  
and they're always happy so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited  
those were my uh starting points  
yeah  
oh but there has to be  
right  
yeah  
yeah and in n. x. t. there's no cost right because the <unk> the uh you just don't choose to load those  
excess buttons good buttons  
yeah false  
you can all or we're all uh  
mm-hmm  
but if pep people really want speech recognition then they must be prepared to <unk> to pay more because it's cannot be done for this  
i don't know if it's a  
other functions like audio settings video settings sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used  
and also it helps in terms of people not losing this you know they they're saying oh it's i lose it in the couch  
uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types  
if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter  
and and what people just think about well i'll never have to buy any <unk> batteries again  
well one could argue it's it's a field that's quite a sort of a niche these days isn't it  
small round  
i mean it would behave strangely in the eyes of the user  
okay  
styles are just plain awful  
okay  
can someone read it out  
but that's definitely a possibility  
you're scaring me with l. c. d. man  
mm-hmm  
for instance i mean the test of looking at their entry goes point by point  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah you can have tree setups uh yeah  
okay  
<unk> <unk> come on <unk> a remote control has a battery  
am i correct  
so it's basically more or less how we would like it with a big volume control big channel control and mute and power yeah  
yeah  
i  
so um  
oh then it's good you know like we don't really nee  
maybe it's a  
<unk> for the l. c. d. menu right  
could it run off of two  
is that  
sweet  
so we will uh i will first present what we are going to do in this meeting  
yes  
hmm  
because she has a good position because she has a friend which is starting who is starting a lab there  
then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal which could be uh  
power is again like yeah yeah yeah yeah it's time like yeah  
i got some ideas by the way  
and we have the company logo here and this will be the  
yeah for me it's better if they're by meeting  
i just lost my microphone  
good question  
on the price yeah  
mm  
hmm  
'cause i'm off all friday  
somebody makes the first move  
may <unk> you know maybe even  
yeah  
yeah  
change the volume uh yeah adjust these settings adjust the brightness  
oh two  
um depending on the <unk> amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and <unk> and <unk> you know how much power  
so yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
sports uh they're uh that uh are accessible on on your l. c. d. uh window uh-huh  
uh a <unk> the shot key frame that is the middle here  
mm  
yes okay  
so now the user interface designer  
yeah on your computer or the  
i i mean it's not on here but um  
i will delete this one now because we don't use it yet  
yeah  
yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the <unk> <unk> exact channel numbers ex exactly  
maybe like a touch screen or something  
so this is a kind of service i don't know either they give it for free and uh  
yeah  
uh like  
thing is inside i think sometimes remotes have too many buttons so maybe as simple as possible um as few buttons inside as possible  
<unk> might be one citation for example if if you take the nips arch archive which is available  
um  
mm  
so <unk>  
<unk> <unk> <unk> that  
yeah  
no  
one moment please  
yes let's  
initially there there is a lot of effort yeah  
yeah  
there we go  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
fair enough fair enough  
okay so  
right  
large  
um  
i'm marty um i went to uni at uh u. c. santa barbara and i'm here working on a p. h. d. in psychology  
hmm  
very artistic  
yep and um the user interface design so this is where the trendy stuff comes in  
the cost is probably kind of important  
well i <unk> are now quite trendy and they come in different colours  
i presume it must have been not not spongy last year  
could be raised  
and you know then when you haven't batteries around and probably for two weeks your remo i've experienced that that  
but like i said like i don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily  
mm  
yeah the shared lounge the the assistants with their professors  
well  
it's quite expensive yes  
mm-hmm  
furthermore fifty percent says  
thank you  
uh for the use of different uh devices  
um i uh i go for the positive  
oh i totally  
yeah  
that's cool  
so um at the moment i'm just whenever it needs to be repainted  
you are two  
yeah yeah  
okay so i guess we need you know something that can fit a banana  
then maybe we can more or less use the same code and just make a few ifs and stuff  
no  
uh-huh  
but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends  
if we want to attach to each of those segments one number for now  
yeah  
i really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work  
<unk> dinosaur  
uh sorry  
no no no  
ah right  
so and it's more less or less the same what i'm doing  
mm-hmm  
it's better i would say  
alright  
it looks likes a banana  
i have to tick and tick  
right  
and uh <unk> a reasonable choice for that right  
i don't know  
doesn't matter  
i just don't think of remote controls as <unk> something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits  
then the case do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved  
could we use like a jog dial like a nice just sort of round somewhere on it where you just roll it  
right  
i don't know  
so you have buttons for your favourite channel changing the volume  
hmm  
yeah  
mm right <unk>  
okay sure  
j. and j.  
uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim  
yeah  
but i'm just saying like with that thing you would easily have an algorithm which at the moment provides you for each word with a score which we can use  
we've evaluated it and we can say that we came out with a value of three  
no  
so like uh well i dunno what's it like  
silver has to shine and rubber doesn't shine  
now if you wanted that you can't do titanium  
i don't really have any  
there it goes  
to look at the demos that are uh i with the what they call the s. d. k. uh software development kit  
so what the user requires  
well the next part uh might be a little bit  
uh to come back to your question i think uh and the people in milan and paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard  
and that's <unk>  
uh it's <unk> uh okay  
but it's too  
um any questions before we get started  
like <unk> uh you you you say we can use speech  
yeah  
our case design  
if we could do something like that that displays like a five line summary when you you're about to open the file or something like that  
yeah that's about it  
excellent  
well yeah  
i want to watch uh i. t. v. one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five  
yeah  
okay but <unk>  
but i don't think that's too bad because the first thing is there's a good reason for inviting everyone in p. p. l. s. because we are in one school  
oh well you should be able to set which t. v. you have  
but but th but okay but you you can incorporate the <unk> if <unk> if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and <unk>  
but personally i wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control  
this is a kind of lower point but uh it kind of it crosses over with deciding  
well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board  
i i isn't there set up involved in changing around for somebody else  
so uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options or screen options to change the brightness  
um okay  
oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode  
hmm  
the button has also colour  
what's that that's creeping over the other screen  
um first about my role role of the industrial designer  
yeah you give it a sample uh one  
um  
is to be uh something useful uh i'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature  
um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative  
<unk>  
okay so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again  
i think something like that would be good  
you can uh but i don't think that uh  
and we have twenty four hour news channels now too so those are our new product requirements  
great  
i've looked at looked at a <unk> uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles  
but i think according to my information this would be two curves  
sorry i i shouldn't intervene probably  
you can still um build maybe the the same argument structure over the top of the basic um acts and <unk> content that's there  
hey those <unk> arcs why are there for  
oh industrial  
so we're gonna have like a menu button so that we can access on screen things then  
yeah  
but perhaps later so uh  
in my experience what you usually should have is some kind of um what's it over head <unk> um beamer  
and now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen  
well <unk>  
i think that would be a good idea  
so double or triple  
and that would be quite convenient for a lot of things because then we can sort of have a lot of information in the display in the in the way that just when the mouse is over it  
yeah i mean these these ones on the side are curved kind of so  
no and it doesn't give any added value  
okay yeah  
rather than having a functional look and feel uh good  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately  
you know <unk> <unk> each turn so if we  
it's a really crazy dog  
i'd say six 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one rather than the way you've got it  
of things for each for each like sort of time sampling slot and and calculate a value for this and once we have this array  
because we would need four extra buttons to replace it up down left and right  
yeah  
and it makes you different you know  
i'll get back to my thing then  
yeah it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap  
we compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool  
it won't talk back  
i've got <unk> uh one thing to check and one person to ask if she'll volunteer to be a head  
mm-hmm  
was the percentage overlap and that made the score  
okay  
print plate  
which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses  
we could do that  
putting things together um <unk> transform the data into uh <unk> into the format to to uh to communicate with the t. v. set  
i can't whistle  
good  
lapel lapel lapel  
mm-hmm  
yeah <unk> which buttons you like or not  
escape  
no  
mm  
um  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
f. eight  
mm-hmm  
so we will close uh this meeting  
right  
it it has no function i agree  
you can put it in that in that way  
then <unk> you may need to poodle around a bit looking for something  
mm  
more or less covered what we need to cover i think <unk> an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the <unk> moving on to the prototype  
no only  
it's  
different  
yeah  
okay  
i think it's really cool  
yeah  
but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down  
since now all yeah  
yeah  
my name is <unk> montoya  
but you're generating p. l. p. <unk> from  
hmm  
light light please  
is it okay  
but yeah exactly  
we also discussed that  
mm-hmm  
fashionable people will buy it  
yeah  
so i think that's about as much as we could do to have an hour and a half then have a coffee break  
yeah  
so so yeah  
and then you have the <unk> and then you have to do m. o. s. um testing and  
yeah  
if we have the <unk> no buttons if we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons we would have uh we have thirteen euros  
we're good  
yeah  
but i think the <unk> difference might be that we want just want to have um the words  
for every single word  
yes  
um  
okay  
well with the interface it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh  
but even we can have some uh l. c. d. display like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go <unk> because  
like the nokia uh the removable covers uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one  
well i i think so because um when you have a <unk> newspaper over your remote control you cannot see it  
well we think so  
mm-hmm  
yeah so then you have a bit more freedom to  
you always try to find a good button and click it but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
yeah i understand  
yeah but i don't think room is really an issue  
yeah  
okay  
so  
um but let's just wait for this to load up and i'll show you  
i think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command  
okay  
that was your evaluation uh show okay so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results  
well i can i can uh  
looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that i didn't do  
could we have look at the <unk> the the prod the <unk> the cost  
but i plan already  
obviously yeah  
my leg  
yeah  
oh  
it ta takes a little  
you take one  
uh you can see that it could go to seven hundred and when it's there is nothing it's can be zero  
and older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus  
so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display  
yeah  
eh um  
it may be like a cow or i dunno whatever  
mm-hmm  
yeah you can put that on the side if if we would like to  
so five seven ten sixteen twenty one  
yeah  
those points um  
yeah  
hmm  
i should know  
they synch up for the purpose of evaluating the data  
yeah but uh likelihood that's something and something  
i'll say five  
yeah  
the speech signal yeah  
yeah yeah  
you could place a um uh this this would be the button  
hmm  
i'm gonna give a seven in everything so  
first for example fifty percent of the words in any kind of text are stop words  
it's just there are too many t. v. <unk> out there  
yeah  
so  
and they want maybe an uh l. c. d. screen um to to look it um <unk> what's on every channel uh and uh what do i want with it  
now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t. v. <unk>  
yeah  
mm  
um so this is one uh step  
oh well i'm gonna draw it on the board then  
three to one  
i think it's more or less the same as we had  
it's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna  
twenty five euro  
so i well i i don't know  
um so we'll be  
like i think that would be in a as in like in for the design sorry um  
i know where it is  
the user interface is easy  
uh uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons  
oh sorry  
like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style but  
uh no they're they're they're the same size as the as the original blobs basically  
yeah that's nice  
yep  
so here um for those who get a <unk> that get a very high score  
mm-hmm  
yeah how much uh  
let me just get this going first  
oh really  
so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted  
sorry carry on  
do you think  
people sorry  
mm-hmm  
universal  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
if you make it uh just a yeah <unk> give it a blue colour then it's just a neutral colour  
and the recent fashion update uh according to fashion watchers in paris and milan  
<unk> it yeah  
that adding this whole like p. d. a. pen business is only one more thing to lose so we're gonna have to be careful with what like  
yes  
no  
so being able to answer questions like um were there any counter proposals to the <unk> you know banana shape or whatever  
uh well you know it's uh this <unk> uh gamma posterior is written in terms of forward and backward h. m. m. <unk>  
'kay  
oh we have a one  
'kay  
um and  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
um spongy material  
tells me uh something about uh the sim the the fact that they could be on the same category in the the this end end label categories  
no so that's mostly red and green i believe  
that's it  
you know what happened to me today like i forgot about the <unk> i'm not sure if we had that problem before  
i don't know  
oh yeah uh-huh  
but we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful  
and it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with  
and that is the critical thing that we're missing in order to be able to um understand what's happening in these meetings  
thanks  
and for a t. v.  
so yes so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market  
no  
of impending doom  
but otherwise it's superb  
i think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting  
and so uh  
yeah okay  
you select a function like <unk> like uh bass  
hmm  
it's cheap yeah  
you there it is  
ah i  
right  
then we should probably find some abstraction model  
okay so um project process  
that's possibly it  
having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always  
um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade off between um uh size and functionality  
i don't know  
for this guy here yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
more things  
so it should be when you save  
uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have <unk> <unk> to do  
um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions  
well you found that then  
so that's what the market tells us  
okay mm-hmm  
yeah  
right  
if you find if <unk>  
uh-huh  
i think it's uh we defined everything according to  
yeah and you use these buttons the most huh  
okay so we can talk about finance now  
that's really low  
but is everyone's called functional requirements  
mm  
but we we  
budgeted  
right  
typically a remote has either two double a. <unk> or four triple a. <unk> sometimes three  
um because it can be replaceable we just kinda went with the colour  
and the <unk>  
we have for now if we just do something which for every  
yeah  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
for <unk>  
oh yeah  
hmm  
you <unk> uh you said you are currently in uh implementing the idea  
um any other com what what are we missing here  
okay  
yeah  
yeah 'cause i've i really don't know um why that would be  
and and the buttons should they have colours  
yeah  
we are doing just the television  
we're gonna have a beep  
right  
yeah and we should probably make some logic when it displays it that says if there's ones very close together it just centres it among the  
yes  
seven  
i think definitely doing something different  
yeah  
but if we do go with the with the speech recognition then it then our scale goes up quite a bit i think  
well we have uh <unk> you have to have a bit of <unk> in the in the discussions too because it becomes too too too too <unk>  
but it's something at least identify something that we'd hope to get out of it you know  
i thought that was what you were doing  
and then uh if you're if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more  
yeah  
format  
wow  
mm-hmm  
so here i'll give you the so this is the cradle unit and this is the actual remote itself  
yeah but do you see that as a  
yeah that's twelve point three so we're still  
yeah <unk> it's like that yeah  
it's okay  
you can just preview your <unk> you can just preview your page in the in the programme  
uh the shapes and they can have different assembly  
that counts  
of course  
um i don't really know what to talk about  
okay  
now our design team research team  
uh user interface type  
well it seems like i dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um  
they group them into <unk> they colour them and uh they have different forms as well  
different <unk>  
but  
is there anything we can do to improve this  
actually  
but  
um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it  
yeah i would imagine  
okay  
<unk> they've even got things like that  
now we kind of have to come to some decisions um  
yeah  
yes  
oh one thing that we've almost not talked about at all my apologies for that um user interface  
um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings  
um i think that it i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now  
was there  
no  
we can also make it flat  
new materials new <unk> uh this fancy strawberry design  
mm  
it's it's uh it's but listen this is a science  
yeah  
yeah  
maybe  
is it not is it not only two days anyway  
so we uh we will wait for anna a few minutes  
okay  
but and it is a kind of other design i mean  
one means absolutely not true seven means true  
like uh <unk> uh give confirmation or something  
yeah it <unk> could be difficult yeah  
well it's it's it's pretty new pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really all this flipping open thing and  
but i mean yeah  
yeah  
i i sort of have always taken the view that um that well people aren't very good at at this kind of rationality you know  
oh yeah that's right  
maybe five percent you know and how much  
and then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes  
that slide was like that  
oh so you haven't put a hyphen there  
draw  
uh  
yeah  
and the a. a. t. is an observatory as well isn't it  
that's it  
yeah yeah for a specific  
type of <unk> maybe another market segment  
great  
let me check  
mm-hmm  
but even that's less of a big deal now right because all the little um i. <unk> yeah  
should we quickly look at the last slide  
so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just <unk> bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion  
yeah  
yeah  
ah you did get that in then mm-hmm  
crap  
did you get the email  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah  
or  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
because then i think in chinese is different written volume is different written than um swahili or something  
it's about the working of the remote control  
it's good for group spirit  
you do you know what i mean  
mm  
all of them of course  
yeah they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down  
use it  
mm okay  
so i know i know where i used to live here  
so we're still in meeting aren't we  
that's an add on  
i think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn  
yeah  
but maybe it's a better way um so what i mean by that is that sorry i'm trying to process all this  
okay  
i would  
good morning  
no  
yeah  
change the colour so  
oh that one looks almost com just you need to  
after i mean if you make a durable remote they are faded you can just buy a new cover  
very good  
okay  
or fourteen seconds  
it's on the <unk> booking system  
and clearly yeah touch screen you've mentioned  
<unk> the target group  
but we're talking about the <unk> the continuum though  
i don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included but i think it's an interesting i think that maybe shows more about uh  
and how  
alright  
yeah  
to not yes to keep hubble  
yeah  
um  
is practically sound  
but you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down so that there's room for the for the interface  
sorry  
and no internet  
the right hand corner far right  
um  
no  
well i <unk> uh danny danny i'll do that because i draw the uh  
oh i i  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
oh this is is frozen frozen okay  
so i'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know  
because it's a task breakdown  
right  
yeah they will just i will just take i would uh take over the names they have anyway  
so i mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh i mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably  
yeah  
so those are what um we'll <unk> construct the remote  
that information is also not there  
so that's like all the analysis that you need to do to things  
uh he's using uh twelve point five yeah twelve point five millisecond  
ah that's why it won't meet  
mm-hmm  
so but there also some variations which i call complex exchanges  
oh nee oh seven is it  
um and that they say that's used zero point eight times an hour which is actually somewhat high  
do you think it's important  
a lot of <unk>  
uh also the case material uh i think that plastic is the is the best with rubber because uh wood or titanium  
'kay  
well that's right but it solves the problem of having different noises  
okay  
so okay  
uh no just escape  
yeah yeah  
mm 'kay  
i'll give it uh a one  
or forty  
with an e.  
and  
that's cute  
and uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product  
<unk> i think the <unk> easier if you have a lot of options but if you don't have a lot of option then  
yeah yeah  
or even like you know notes about um what you wanna watch  
so um  
so channel programming  
we we can we can we <unk> yellow  
mm  
um  
you respond to whatever you get huh  
try it again  
yeah uh not really  
i'll say one  
um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well  
right  
yeah  
uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here  
so i guess that would be solvable if not  
um and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design  
new ideas found  
a novelty  
a four and a three together  
yeah you know so you have to have the remote control  
okay  
so no d. v. d. no <unk> no stereo  
uh it's an apple  
uh  
uh logo  
i would say maybe a two 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
alright  
sure  
aye  
that's not a scroll wheel  
yeah we'll  
okay  
i know i was thinking that might be a problem  
yeah  
yeah the interface maybe can  
okay very very quickly  
uh-huh  
it might be possible to do it in the <unk>  
okay  
you could you know you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages  
yeah  
so that's that  
yeah i mean initially i don't know why there is a a shot detected  
so maybe we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller maybe try to mix them these two concepts together  
maybe we could go with a square or something  
yeah they're <unk> it's a kind of lizard  
this is so i <unk> i heard a creaky voice and it was audible of the level of the rest of the speech  
i'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting  
some people have a habit of just reading what they've got on their slides and some people are com are are well  
and uh well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour  
but our our our what's it project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets to customers that are younger than forty  
so i couldn't whenever i got cable i had to get a new t. v.  
yep you're right  
but um maybe that comes up i don't know  
so you could be exploring the figure or you could be just somewhere in the region defined as the figure but not on it  
yeah  
um i started filling it in but of course these are provisional so we have to go down  
is it five <unk> is it almost two  
okay  
okay let me just try to get them all to a different screen  
wood do you think wood will be a good idea  
right  
yes  
i don't think it's necessary  
no itself  
mm-hmm  
european yeah commission  
you better get started  
okay  
so i mean i we'll put three but i think we actually reached our goal  
<unk> <unk>  
yeah but then you run out of time  
i'm the marketing expert  
it's small and that we've got like the the <unk> slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side  
i guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well  
no you you can carve it into the titanium at the back  
in fact uh that's uh it's another thing this optic  
because we're working with different types of television so we're going to work with that  
yeah  
uh  
yeah  
and the contracts say eighth of may which is longer in advance than which is a greater amount of time than six weeks  
yeah i'm sure he'll let us uh test it out before we do it  
okay good  
yeah okay  
um so the the what i would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a <unk> a less complicated um design  
so uh  
mm-hmm  
no no you you should not wait till the end  
yes this one  
yeah  
yeah that's important too  
okay let's go with five then  
the the sort of circular section because that seems to be for a video as well  
well most the time to to <unk> yeah  
okay  
yeah  
uh yep  
great  
oh  
this time it should come up both  
yeah i know i know my pen vibrates  
so i have to look if that's possible  
the  
or have have you discussed with them  
mm  
uh  
yep  
okay  
yeah  
only use ten percent of the buttons  
okay  
so really um  
yeah that makes sense  
you think that yellow it's kitsch  
mm  
yep  
well the good thing about that is that then you know that when you go through and parse you'll be getting the same chunks as when you do this process automatically  
mm yeah  
mm-hmm  
um  
okay well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about  
what new ideas have we found  
it almost helps you <unk> keep a grip too 'cause it goes in between fingers  
work for that  
well you can pretty much read what it is that i'm doing  
okay  
and the demographics of  
mm-hmm  
dang it  
you can  
and on th and then uh <unk> a base unit underneath it  
you also  
but still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional so uh  
okay  
what are we bringing in to take the place of this and we have to <unk> in my opinion we have to double up  
ho not that pen  
yeah  
i'm sure that'd be fine  
i mean it's but i would say there is more too much red  
yeah but the topic isn't it  
i mean is it gonna  
yes yes  
mm-hmm  
getting the external power source yep that's quite true  
but okay because there is no motion in fact between the two shots  
i agree  
so no speech recognition  
what does that mean  
twenty twenty eight  
and the other people  
but let's not focus on the front  
um i've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um i would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting  
then you'd probably be right in this case right  
so there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy  
ah well let's go  
is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology  
so still um we can't uh <unk> encode a speech  
i just thought um it didn't work anymore  
the <unk> the result was no  
made out of plastic  
oh cool  
oh that's just great  
okay  
wow  
i noticed that uh uh the interaction degrees of interaction in the meetings uh varies from parts to parts  
no i mean no good idea good idea  
um  
alright  
but that's not in the trend  
uh pepper  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yep  
the functional design the <unk> design and the detailed design  
we can use a regular <unk> presentation  
and then just only a back button  
um okay so these are my personal preferences  
but you don't use games when you're <unk> when you're making a telephone call  
and which one uh probably the first one  
from i think should be in there  
three four nine  
one curve  
um  
mm i see  
yeah  
so you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery  
mm-hmm  
ah i dunno  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
so it's thirty two millisecond frames taken each  
or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one we go this way for the other  
mm-hmm  
no it's okay yeah i understand  
but don't put sugar in it it's not working  
that's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button  
no but but ma he's he may be linking to matthew i guess because matthew got the <unk> files  
so you kinda take it up one at a time  
yeah you can <unk> that's in a menu  
yeah yeah  
working design  
oh i think um  
it's alright  
if maybe if we <unk> that there's massive differences in in gain or in something  
and it's fire wire  
but i presume this is <unk> i presume this is just for television  
i think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer  
uh  
yeah that's what they did  
<unk> everybody <unk> was agreeing every yeah  
i don't know really how it works  
why not you know you can this is you know i guess we can have a little bit of fun with it  
it's good yeah  
you know  
mm  
that's only part of the picture about what of what the page is really about and the links pointing to that page are also part of the picture  
ah  
and  
close your laptop  
there are ninety one percent of uh the people or something like that  
yeah  
uh i have to say though that um another <unk> come up in my head  
i'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures  
well  
seven eight oh  
no no  
a bunch of little routines that take the the g. d. f. without this information in it and add new information into th sub script versions of the g. d. f. file that contains these post process analyses  
a curve mm-hmm  
yeah  
and say we just put in the money get exchange structure marked up on that entire hub or you know  
i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to  
yeah if if you down um  
um  
um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the <unk> to the market  
tech  
no for continuum  
is a bit more impressive than my rabbit  
um  
okay i go but next time you'll do something i'm sure  
they ca they each can see it <unk> by their data and the other one is the static one  
you have to wind it up  
<unk>  
yeah  
this uh these are the l. c. d. screens  
so now  
mm yeah  
mm-hmm like the middle button  
mm mm  
by content or by channel  
mm-hmm  
oh it doesn't have to be bold anymore  
as well for the for the older people  
yeah yeah  
yeah rate of speech is also possibility  
yeah but but but  
okay  
beep beep beep  
okay  
you we can check the <unk>  
do the penn tree bank and then create the chunks off that or you could chunk directly  
um my own preferences i prefer the the clunky one  
tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was  
yeah um  
width  
um  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
sure  
comes to that later  
so yeah  
so he doesn't really care about the band widths or he want to have the quality no like  
it's very necessary  
yeah  
oh no we don't need that  
that's what i did uh  
well hopefully some people have people coming <unk> over to <unk> to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room  
and um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have  
uh and i think the most  
mm-hmm  
so you can tell what it's meant to replace then  
mm-hmm  
um  
uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case  
this ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work  
like a other colour than this one  
round but square  
so that's it  
good  
hey but you can erase that  
uh  
taking all the credit  
not much  
okay  
the feel of to be spongy  
but i think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um  
mm-hmm  
you have some in in australia right  
that should be highlighted  
region where people have more than one television in a home  
yeah  
our design  
okay so basically i'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control  
uh and it's a threshold but still it's adaptive right if i remember well yeah  
the chip is advanced because we have the advanced features  
mm  
so okay  
users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven  
so on a scale of one to seven  
i thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped  
alright  
mm <unk> yeah  
and um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext  
mm-hmm  
so i think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead  
no  
if not sure if it what it does to document it would probably make the yeah if if you have segments for that probably the  
yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user  
maybe in a circle for example like we like in this example  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
right  
i dunno  
he's going to do the future  
my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high tech a design which looks high tech  
mm-hmm  
i think it would be good actually  
me too very chic  
mm  
pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip  
i think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their t. v. remote they need another one that'll work with their t. v.  
speak uh yeah different task and  
okay so i'll just meet you in in eighteen a in the afternoon  
yeah so there you <unk> again see the list  
yep  
then skip it because it's probably something with a dot in between which is usually not something you wanna have and  
mm-hmm  
i figure i should do something like that but i'm gonna do something much more difficult  
so that's what we don't want  
oh right okay  
yeah  
um and the technology has definitely been a help it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff  
oh dear  
and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway aren't we  
okay  
the <unk> the case the case alone is is is uh  
i'm just uh  
mm-hmm  
i think it would be cool if we could check the nite clock <unk> code or whatever code it is for this component and see if we can access those rate things and and do something useful with them and get notified when they change and stuff  
yeah right  
well it's quite different thing and uh you don't really get uh a name for it  
yeah  
so  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah but it that doesn't have to remind you you know like explicitly of <unk> our <unk> of a of a specific piece of fruit  
um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it  
you do need them  
all of them should have r. r. yeah  
might be difficult to find that out  
yeah  
not to worry  
alright  
exactly  
we can pretend  
i have maybe a silly question  
but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions or you take out the smaller piece  
so you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool no  
true  
um yeah it could be either be here or make a double microphone  
well  
two  
okay  
not rotated  
<unk> <unk> what kind of new ideas  
yeah  
no wait a little bit under six  
like are used in high tech watches where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up  
yes  
alright  
mm-hmm <unk> <unk>  
so uh this is just one um thing i one parameter uh for mm-hmm  
okay okay okay  
yeah  
just one  
but so is h. beta <unk> uh emission as a process from h. beta  
yeah  
right  
what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material  
so uh that's gonna particularly be a problem for j. p. right  
um  
yep  
you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b. b. c. one and it goes to that channel  
<unk> where i've got my information from is a survey where the <unk> lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire  
presentation three  
i agree with that  
project method functional design individual work another meeting conceptual design individual work and a meeting of details design individual work and a meeting  
but  
mm  
yep  
except you're not hooked up to the great  
yeah  
it's yeah it's easy to learn <unk> and uh  
to make something new  
yeah  
so  
mm  
mm  
yeah yeah  
and i think that's what we <unk> yes  
yeah  
so  
nope  
i think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous  
take precedence yeah  
because who is the one who makes who actually uses what we <unk> try to do here  
so i'd be up for seven for innovation  
yeah and maybe two or three other options but not nothing more than that  
why is that is that the right thing to do analytically  
so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
um  
export h. t. m. l.  
um  
so it's not worth spending the extra money  
yeah yeah  
but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it you know it's weird  
real reaction  
make them make them think of fruit yeah  
oh yeah they might be movable  
the average  
packet  
um yeah  
yeah alright but then we we won't get there  
uh again seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot  
is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours  
for example if you add two more <unk> then better you add two more buttons  
i suppose having that would complicate it a lot more  
okay  
but  
yeah  
well personally i like walking into a shop and choosing a colour  
yeah  
we could make a little r. and r. on the top of the machine  
and uh in fact <unk> what we we are doing now we project um another screen on on the table  
okay  
ah you didn't draw it yourself  
but you know the whole  
it's just phone recognition or something like  
yeah  
if you <unk>  
why is that  
uh-huh  
one uh impulse there or <unk> line for  
yeah  
no but i i because we have to use the special colour anyway  
okay  
yeah  
right okay  
i think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice  
<unk>  
hmm  
yeah yeah sure  
alt up  
yeah  
okay yeah  
we have to find cost  
right okay  
just total it flipped uh in in a mirror image  
if you have questions  
um 'cause uh you know audio settings <unk> point eight percent  
yes  
um this is what they sent me  
okay  
mm  
so we need like several of us need a dictionary  
right  
and the other columns are showing the performance of uh different kind of gamma  
i mean if you wanna go back to the last slide  
volume is true  
um  
yeah but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons you have to have uh channel setting if you wa if you have a new t. v.  
it's gonna cost twenty five euros  
this is a real hassle and a oops  
yeah yeah  
so okay functional requirements  
uh i think i can uh make it uh difficult but we all  
yeah things like screen settings and audio settings i would generally  
well uh who who else thinks like you  
uh it's a it's a beginning  
mm-hmm  
i think the buttons i <unk> i prefer you know  
maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please where are you  
yeah  
yeah make it a two  
um that might be an issue with people are bringing laptops  
the infrared is like that's considered a  
no well something trendy and original well that that goes hand in hand i guess  
mm-hmm  
likely to buy it  
yeah  
yeah  
i don't feel like it's been that long  
yeah  
not just in terms of no longer having recognition errors whenever silence appears  
yeah  
um i think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah  
they liked the wood a lot  
and if you if you do need to argue that these two kinds of group activities uh can can only be <unk> if you use different analytical mechanisms  
yeah  
no no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the <unk>  
but it's on the same lines in that uh have have you guys seen this uh correlated topic models work  
with with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing  
ten percent each  
if we choose this we cannot use titanium  
we wouldn't have line ratios  
okay the case will be <unk> and flat or a single curve or a double curve  
it's very wrong  
but uh uh i think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority then we should as i say  
anyway results are not very important but they should be within a range of uh acceptable numbers  
but we don't have that so fast  
and then you  
yeah  
<unk>  
where  
mm-hmm  
that would be a nice way to use it but i mean yeah i'm thinking big already  
well that's interesting  
or get your mouse  
<unk>  
yeah so no it's it's one  
keep it simple and look more at th  
so  
yeah but you <unk> you said that that a lot of functions aren't used  
my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the l. c. d. and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be  
and basically one thing for example we're trying to do and and again this is something that can fit huh  
h. v. c. is it this  
i mean there probably are a bunch of issues like if you've got a hundred hours of meetings and they all talk about a lot of the same things  
and  
we have the sub menus and stu stuff  
simple ones  
twenty milliseconds  
we'll use the the basic functions for a television  
uh it it has yeah  
hmm  
and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext ignoring everything except the t. v.  
mm-hmm  
oh okay  
the links between some labelled document and <unk> document  
if you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can  
spongy  
you can probably just make some simple simple <unk> but that really depends on how much time we have and and how much is necessary  
like duplication of effort and stuff and um yeah  
yeah  
people tend to kinda come and go from them  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh no i don't know anything but maybe uh anyone else uh yeah  
plus that's a nice wee design touch  
<unk> okay  
that when you drop it it won't break  
no  
um  
i don't want a banana on my living room table a banana remote  
yeah  
so the the good thing about that would be that if you simply say that whatever  
a fox yeah  
but still  
right  
mm-hmm  
so everybody's agree with an uh three on it it's  
nope  
yeah  
um i have some uh a method a requirements and scale of  
so we have to put stress on this uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design  
it's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing but never mind  
yellow rubber  
so in a sense that's the point  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so what they do is they've got a distribution that maps uh a gaussian and some space into a distribution on this thing  
well three to three to five  
okay  
um for for innovation so we've got the speech the speech thing and  
mm  
okay  
yes  
um  
but we are not sure to to buy it now  
i quite like the shape  
that's quite a yes  
okay  
yes because for example for part of that time both b. and a. are probably looking at the construct okay  
how high is it  
definitely when when i first filled out the questionnaire i was marking it probably higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed over it and then by the time i got to the last one i was like  
i'd say we go two 'cause like <unk> the fanciest would be the double curved  
damped lyman alpha systems  
my <unk> and i were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and i was like i need to get one for everything  
but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting that that worked in terms of  
yeah but again  
yeah  
so the shape now  
yeah you really need buttons for changing a channel  
it's more important that first we want to to have some events like two people are talking or one one started and another started and uh well  
that might also be a good sales pitch again  
so  
yeah i think that would be best  
why  
coffee  
oh  
yeah  
uh  
it has relatively few features with  
i think we did pretty well too  
it need maybe some <unk> further work but it's  
oh  
and uh  
yeah  
yeah  
i i don't  
when we if we discuss with franck uh franck <unk> or uh uh frank uh <unk> and we'll see okay and go and try to see  
or not  
uh i i would i would actually agree with this sounds logical  
and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable  
yes  
you still want me the presentation  
uh i uh draw i i've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence  
and this here represents the screen where you where you'd go through  
cool  
that would be evil  
uh  
yeah be the screens  
is this okay  
yeah  
you could just like sort of zoom back out so you got the full text for that segment or that meeting rather than a summary  
mm-hmm  
i i used it it it was you can use it it's quite handy i think  
tho yeah those  
hmm  
might be but <unk> that's not gonna be such a costly feature  
would spend more money if it looks fancy  
mm-hmm  
we're under  
it's all automatic  
so i call the meeting closed  
mm i see yes okay  
one thing it goes on to talk about which is interesting is the hang on a minute  
mm you have questions  
and i was to type up these minutes and work on the final report  
yeah  
yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use we uh we make  
there we go  
so i think it would be a good point to to <unk> to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost  
okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls  
hmm  
i it it is <unk>  
i would say that's ex excellent  
what's your <unk>  
but we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes  
um alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality  
true  
uh i'm i'm sure the <unk> se  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's just mo changing it a bit  
if they like the way it looks the way it functions so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it  
i am the industrial designer so  
yeah  
and you get a much greater degree um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one five in one <unk>  
yeah we need the chip for the for the l. c. display  
ah  
so what are our findings  
agenda three  
'kay  
do them on the actual television itself like here you have a  
oh i'm sure it'd be quite straightforward some of the tasks we have to do  
fifteen euros  
yeah  
yeah it doesn't say  
is th is that similar enough that that this same method could apply that we derive chunks off the h. p. s. g. output  
end of march might be okay  
so it has to be made in the buttons i think  
no the power cord itself  
so um we could use titanium wood or plastic uh or uh  
mm uh-huh  
so quite small then  
a repetitive strain injury  
group  
mm-hmm hmm  
zero to nine  
so uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it  
we already decided that on the previous meeting  
okay  
materials that people find pleasing  
they <unk> yeah yeah  
we can use a hand dynamo  
um  
i but it does have replacement  
oh right  
yeah even the panel discussions <unk> i think one is really held in small room so people were really crowded  
if you know what i mean  
<unk> there the sample sensor sample speaker thing  
yeah but i so i  
but results from <unk>  
right  
yeah okay  
yeah  
yeah  
so here's an agenda  
no it's it was uh not enough  
yeah it sets if you look at set select that's essentially what you wanna do yeah  
like cutting corners  
and i'm gonna use the <unk> just 'cause we haven't used it  
a fish  
uh-huh  
okay well i guess we have to  
yeah  
it's almost every piece of equipment um  
but once that's figured out it should be fine  
um yeah so yeah  
in general we haven't if unless it's specifically saying it's a line but i guess the question is just as specifically referred to a line  
see everybody in a half hour  
like with the with the browser as a whole and where the data comes in and  
you you have two representation one which comes from this link uh stuff and one <unk> this one is not based on p. l. s. a. too  
most the most used uh buttons  
if we mm-hmm  
uh  
which  
so much for the the workings of the  
uh is the the event that is detected is um will be uh a sum of uh small parts  
working design  
but  
yeah  
uh depends  
this is just more like a <unk> <unk> yeah  
so the cost is in the budget the evaluation is okay so i th i think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party  
yeah  
it's not because it's functional but it's just to add to the design to have it flashy  
because i had the information uh you take uh the remote control you pick it up at least two times a day  
m. p. three player like any electronic devices  
because uh i don't know which which um what i what is running where uh if it's <unk> or which uh approach this is  
yeah  
apples  
so you have to decide there's trade offs there  
um  
yeah is that  
we just have the  
on the remote  
with the the <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
so i already tried it once and i'm sure they gave us a password  
okay  
twelve point five  
i think th i think the yeah the layout of the screen and i think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the  
ooh  
i mean we can stick it in in there i think  
okay  
right  
and uh my personal preference is yes i would like also preferably to use r. w. circuit  
okay  
okay  
well  
i think you did an awesome job  
well <unk> <unk> <unk> you could have but uh  
and then you draw a topic given that <unk> distribution and then you draw words given that  
yeah  
yeah maybe maybe may it's the next prototype maybe we <unk>  
yeah i was wondering that because i <unk> i agree that there <unk> people with uh how can i put it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no no no no i the end point system is different thing no  
so maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation  
mm-hmm  
i tried to code some stuff uh it but uh i'm not so confident in the way uh it is uh coded  
so these are the slight problems  
um it's only if they're used in different contexts  
yeah yeah  
mm okay  
yep  
ye yeah  
so if we want to do a special thing that probably runs fast it may be easier to do it directly and uh yeah  
thank you  
oh god  
that should be nice  
you start something and then eighteen months later you pick up to do the last ten percent of the work to finish it off or whatever  
we have five minutes left for the meeting so  
so last slide  
sorry  
you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television  
then i've uh had a few findings made a few findings  
you the user interface and management man uh  
yeah  
so there are three kinds of designs that's all  
um yeah  
that's what yeah  
because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental  
yeah  
use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work not like three <unk> worth of meetings  
i was because  
mm-hmm  
yeah so you always lose the special colour  
um in that case the the <unk> tends to be very bad  
uh  
yeah  
focus on uh the i  
so basic remote operation runs as follows press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit  
uh  
okay okay  
yeah you might nor really want to be creating a new one every time you move the mouse  
when you click on a segment it's gonna have like words or whatever that are important  
so meet say five till seven that should be enough time  
i we maybe you should present it on your laptop 'cause we can be really sure it's running before we come  
okay  
yeah but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it  
okay  
right okay um  
yeah that's well it's not reading that in yet but that will be part of the data manager as well  
yeah that's it for the working design  
so of all the things that were on the <unk> do i need to pull up the <unk>  
hmm  
yeah  
if if it's uh just some kind of back channel or it's just a signal signal the <unk> the speaker is listening or is understanding what's going on yeah  
okay that could be <unk>  
okay  
uh display  
i'm not so <unk> display huh  
but then weak yeah okay nothing at all  
yes but five is between four and six  
right  
see the cut  
i think it's clear  
no prob  
don't show me that tip again  
okay  
isn't hard to lose  
okay which is  
so got a bit of  
most of the users  
yes  
just numbers  
it was the fact that sometimes professor have to professors have to discuss sensitive matters about projects and financing  
but the but the buttons have their own <unk> or not  
but it it's <unk> nice for young people  
yeah that's a good idea  
okay  
it would be the i imagine that's the tricky part  
um how how well i guess i led it um the how well we worked together as a team um the digital pens the <unk>  
you know this is a way of finding the remote  
th that's an idea  
mm-hmm  
it's not perfect but  
uh-huh  
i didn't for the first one  
difference is uh is that if i just uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
right right  
you wish  
right  
it was crazy  
how what were making for the prototype  
so i'm doing the user interface design  
mm not like the uh basic exchange uh exchanges yeah  
but but there must be the sense right  
i would curve the whole actually  
yeah  
th i think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements i don't <unk> uh know who's doing <unk>  
um the vertical zoom you can adjust that as well so if it seems too flat for you or you can't really  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so this were the findings which we found  
mm-hmm  
somebody would try to solve a very similar problem where they also had two factors sort of and they want to weigh them together  
and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take  
sorry  
uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control  
yeah  
um we'll discuss what the <unk> what functions the the product has to <unk> and so and so on  
um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty  
did you have time earlier to to work on that  
alright so i think it it's  
so  
consider that it can be difficult of course to find them et cetera and so on  
and uh we implemented the <unk> the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping your favourite channels functionality in the scroll  
yeah okay  
no  
okay  
okay  
okay so then if we use double curved case then we have to <unk> choose rubber push buttons and that's fine  
but you still can know obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten  
going on to personal preferences i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote just because of the size  
the speed up doesn't seem to work  
yes it is important for the remote control world  
um  
do you think one would be enough or such as  
uh buttons not too small  
<unk>  
from gross and <unk> and gross and <unk> came all this stuff about shared plans and how you really can't understand  
yeah  
no that's certainly not necessary  
okay  
no no no it's uh or <unk> i'm not sure  
but this is a bit uh how i thought it  
i don't know  
yeah  
i think it's very important to use it uh because it's use it uh  
a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us  
or an isolated magnet or something like or you know something that wouldn't interfere i don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah i like that  
because it says here <unk> features we're now referring to a type of source e. g. quasar  
yeah  
so adding some vocal commands  
i guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before  
that's maybe the cup holder  
oops  
nope  
i <unk> i'd say two i think  
yes  
um  
so the general shape should be like this  
yeah  
okay so we're not focusing on this  
yeah  
it's clothes  
hmm  
okay  
he's very famous but i thought that he was the author no  
look and feel de  
it's  
maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive  
so which is uh good because we had a price gap of twelve point five euros  
bright yellow  
but there's uh also one problem with this i noticed  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
one colour  
the the lemon  
so right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel  
but in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone and it sends a message to the t. v.  
yeah  
uh-huh  
alright okay  
the l. e. d. use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons it's all <unk>  
we cannot really put him with <unk> because well they wouldn't feel very nice they they made a joke about that  
yeah  
mm  
well well there we go  
sorry  
so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls  
i feel like voice recognition would be  
yeah you could do  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you wanna have both options  
well it really we shouldn't even need a flag  
right  
so just have a look at the okay here is the  
um well we've still got the kinetic energy  
maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't  
and a screen  
widths  
i don't see as there's any need to  
okay sure  
i think the scroll button is something also uh new  
would it work as well  
can turn it maybe  
<unk>  
you don't need the carrier  
we're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their <unk> remote control every few days  
that's a stylistic thing as much as anything  
do presentation ready  
mm-hmm  
it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty you know  
yeah  
the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in paris and milan  
it's low weight  
we'll discuss them in the <unk> lab  
its a sort of bunny rabbit cat  
<unk> uh quick uh to my favourite channel <unk> what i uh so the remote mu must see or um  
but um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market i uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market  
and then uh  
that's cool  
ebenezer um marketing expert  
to integrate you know yeah  
so so you are to use the uh uh yeah  
no  
what kind of <unk> fruit would you like to to control your t. v. with  
so you can uh use your television and your d. v. d. player with the same uh remote control  
black and red  
oh okay  
the master class  
but um now let's look  
and i mean <unk> and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting  
i can go back  
and i mean <unk> multiplying two integers or doubles or whatever shouldn't be the thing that slows us down  
okay  
i actually live not that far from there  
oh i didn't <unk>  
actually i think i'm not gonna not gonna start that now because that's probably gonna take too long  
mm  
okay so look and feel innovation  
yeah  
i was thinking that like a flip  
but th uh uh i think what is very important here is the <unk> of the microphones  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so uh i so uh okay  
i'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there  
but ninety percent who <unk> an l. c. d. display and only sixty percent that <unk> speech recognition  
and yellow  
i agree  
no but no  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
hmm i'm not supposed to move this but  
when do you think you'll have um like a primitive segmentation by some ready made topic segmentation by some ready made tool ready  
but that's good you know  
oh okay  
or and you'll have l. c. d. display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least  
yes  
um alright yeah so um i'll just do my presentation on the working design uh  
or is that  
that might be an option  
we can  
hmm  
right the with the non interactive more <unk> mono logic sections of the meeting um you have to uh <unk> them using something akin to rhetorical structure or something  
maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example  
well the logo would be more um <unk> on the actual thing  
well i couldn't find a the picture of the ipod <unk> only linked to a web browser  
yeah  
i have to be here for three years so i might as well get the terminology right  
yeah that's true  
huh  
i thought it was a kind of thing to put it on and then draw right lines or something  
well the kinetic battery  
right  
mm  
yeah but since we are focusing only on t. v. remote controls so we can have more functions for t. v. uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices  
how does it work out with the talks  
yeah  
yeah the segments are made up at the moment but the code's there for integrating real segments  
mm-hmm  
um  
okay  
right i agree that that can go out 'cause that's a fitting thing  
and there are uh a lot of uh wires uh which um connect the components in it  
i think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological <unk> yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery  
no like uh  
okay  
we must use a rubber push buttons to uh the the rubber double curved case is a is a <unk> uh three dimensional uh curve in the in the design  
good job team  
yes  
yeah i don't think we should do that because that would just be <unk>  
as is normal in dialogue <unk> like map task or like your  
um which is the the first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is  
i don't care  
device to help you find it  
mm-hmm  
uh you've got  
but we'll we can try that  
yeah but it should be an agreement you know because even if you can think of the wireless  
yeah  
want to change my <unk>  
yeah  
two  
okay  
so they're <unk> obviously uh the most important buttons  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
commands words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers  
okay  
so we've got more than a thirty minutes  
um well i'll start with the presentation again the agenda  
has uh the signals sent to it  
<unk> is sometimes an issue i think  
<unk> we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're  
the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean  
uh we didn't allow iron spectrum  
we don't need that then  
diff you know like five different face plates  
ah  
so like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control  
yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve yeah  
yeah yeah  
to programme the channels  
are the cost under twelve  
i you know i'm i'm i'm with it i'm up to date  
huh  
sorry six  
there is a functional design  
seventy five percent think they're ugly  
not me  
it might be cool enough  
but you've got keys so so you should be able to get in during odd hours if if you wanted to work  
yep  
uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button  
well i got a better one here and i will um  
it takes a second doesn't it  
but you can't put three desks in the two person rooms  
'cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system  
uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give  
uh this is was uh the evaluation  
mm  
but then both the the separate channels  
i was just writing really big  
yeah  
yeah okay  
uh it's i think it's basically the more you move i it it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it  
you would've thought so but i dunno  
uh because of course first the process is going to be easier and it may be just a few signals that we have to align on the other parts  
okay so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours  
so i'm working on the technical functions design  
mm-hmm  
just repetitive strain injury  
i will yeah  
yeah  
no  
that's kind of strange  
it would be easier on the hands  
yeah  
but uh for some part part where the interaction is very weak uh just uh like the uh chairman or project manager is mm  
something like that  
what  
then the gauss traps  
ooh two  
uh and uh uh  
so yeah that i don't think that is the best way to work at for such project  
and uh not to forget its tail  
i mean do we do both or is it the same thing  
ye  
free  
mm-hmm  
th that's a bit uh waste  
okay  
no the they the the the  
okay but do how do why do you want certain words  
ooh  
it's with cameras  
uh okay  
but you have to think the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so  
oh just the switch no <unk> not for the t. v. for the t. v.  
uh so that's it i think about the concepts  
i think you're right there  
you think bananas are a safe thing to use  
so uh i'm been think about uh if we could come up with some kind of more principal scheme uh taking some of the uh information in the uh uh uh in the uh interaction uh into account  
okay  
um there are cameras  
so a four  
how much data do you need  
don't know if it's that <unk> yeah it might be of help  
huh  
you 'cause the thing is it depends if we want to have it display the whole thing at once  
um sarah you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand held  
okay  
the front but not exchange uh  
or do we have any buttons  
yeah  
that doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though  
alright  
no  
the <unk> down and maybe i dunno solar charged  
yeah pretty good  
we agreed that we would implement both the l. c. d. and speech recognition but i'll get to that in a moment  
so if you press um system that's yeah well <unk> multiple system options can maybe five or ten or or one can fit in  
i'm gonna have to  
well just questionnaires  
the vocabulary is very small so that's not a problem  
um  
um yeah okay  
and uh tool training  
yeah  
'kay alice  
uh and the corporation we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company  
are they  
hi  
or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front  
um in fact like tomorrow for example  
well uh like i i <unk> i distinguish between feature extraction and then the m. l. p.  
hmm  
then you put it in the fruit bowl  
yeah  
and those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research and also finance i guess  
okay okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so the last layer is about this <unk>  
so interaction between uh speech and slides cool  
on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control  
okay  
so  
take the basics and make it nicer and then <unk> obviously uh the u. i. d. and the i. d. you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about <unk> what is possible  
i'm gonna head off  
maybe when you integrate some functions  
was searching and searching  
damped lyman alpha q. s. o.  
so you got parent child relationship and i the child can be a part or it can be another construct  
isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top  
okay  
right and then  
you've got voice recognition computers that's not remote controls  
so what methodology i will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this  
something like that is very ergonomic  
and how do we  
hmm  
thanks for that  
no  
<unk> otherwise you yeah  
no it just says push button interface  
okay  
do we feel it's very easy to use  
um well that's just kind of dictated by the size of the room really isn't it  
no no  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
um but i i think we should see a decent sort of improvement then  
yeah  
in fact my daughter likes <unk> remote controls  
so shall we do a well um  
yeah but you can lose it  
yes  
yeah  
c. d. <unk> are not enough that's the problem  
okay  
maybe after  
yeah but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other so you're passing through all the channels  
yeah 'cause what i'm thinking is how will you will connect the t. v. to internet so  
okay here's the agenda for the meeting  
yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape you know centre is yellow and <unk> <unk>  
something that tells me what channel i'm on i can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two  
i mean that ni  
we need a definition of some kind of uh problem right  
mm-hmm  
uh  
wait a second  
yay  
but it's edible  
yeah  
i mean i i know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever  
wait  
no  
how long did it take them to calibrate  
um  
yeah it's possible  
and of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach  
and the reading room or the lounge as some people call it that we have is in a central position  
mm 'kay  
yeah yeah yeah that's it's it's i wonder what one of these costs  
shouldn't  
but it's up to you  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and one thing you really don't want is ever to have two utterances that could potentially have the same i. d.  
actually we <unk> we didn't do so well on this one  
and um i'm not sure if i put it in the project folder  
um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user friendly as possible  
so you keep um right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting so i've been told  
we should include speech synthesis in this case no  
the three important things of <unk> are uh from th of this year is are is the remote control fancy enough  
yeah yeah yeah  
let me get that  
extra battery yeah  
they are discussed as a separate source type aren't they  
yeah so can i see that thing  
we can make a symbol of the company right here  
uh uh  
i think a <unk> <unk> is pretty cool  
okay  
yep  
just to to start discussing about clearly the project and also um dealing with our kind of timing constraints  
damn  
uh okay so <unk> we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback right  
okay  
did you say  
<unk> another like <unk> it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath  
mm-hmm yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well i also had the of generated <unk> or <unk> or things like this which i should regenerate  
uh yes but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about i think  
alright  
but i <unk> i think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it  
huh  
yes  
yeah  
which gets you  
an i <unk> no yeah  
it's full adaptable  
yeah  
right  
i i th i think  
yeah  
no i'm not not <unk>  
you two you two are gonna be just i think you just double up you know you working together  
not sure what because we have forty minutes i'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway so  
probably an important man  
but nah  
yeah  
um we've just got this split up  
unplug yourself  
it's it's a different scheme  
what else  
mm-hmm  
so  
looks a bit like a game boy now  
i got an email that it's relatively small  
now this is good we've got a good structure going on  
that means you have to through every single utterance in a series of seventy hours of meetings  
okay yeah  
um  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you said it was totally uh unusable  
oh yeah  
perhaps we should make <unk>  
ah  
okay  
i really question where we create the demand  
new thing but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if i've done my math correctly  
i don't think so  
yeah  
yeah that would depend upon us actually  
to see you know how to how to market this thing  
we're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time  
mm-hmm  
ah  
channel changing volume and another rote remote with all the special things  
well i'll get a i'll get the message  
yeah  
well we have to choose one of them  
ooh  
although there are i a few buttons but the inside is is quite uh advanced  
that's the one we haven't covered yet  
so you have <unk> you have to use the the the manual to understand most yeah  
mm  
round i think  
okay  
i guess we're gonna discuss the project financing later making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget  
well thank you  
mm-hmm  
uh name a channel or  
<unk> could buy extra  
yes  
yeah  
it's just yeah well the single curve that  
mm  
go for one  
um  
oh okay 'cause i pretty much summed up all the buttons there were  
yeah  
volume and then power  
the functional requirements it's uh uh very important for uh the user he he wants to yeah  
so  
okay  
i'm from around d. c. ish sort of in the u. s.  
it it just has a couple of yeah yeah  
something like a two a. a. three size batteries  
if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course depends on that  
you can compress the spectrum somehow in in such a way that you rather um preserve those even also those dips not only peaks in the spectrum  
that would be sort of <unk> meetings yeah  
anytime  
and frequency more or less doesn't change  
so that was it was actually their their fault  
well when the when the <unk> when the final construct the the way the the way the the constructs are defined in the file  
yep  
um  
two thirty left  
but you may not be interested in the same series each time  
nick <unk> user interface designer  
well consensus um we we can put it in the middle so  
<unk> titanium stays there  
yeah  
yeah something still a little bright to make it hard to lose but  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> <unk> you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international  
and she will  
so  
mm-hmm  
and what counted as <unk> as for the <unk> features it was more confusing what counted as a <unk> feature and we had a long discussion about that  
yeah yeah  
yes  
and we all have to uh agree on a certain level  
well we uh uh i have um <unk> a few evaluation uh <unk>  
ah right  
oh we were including feature within <unk> feature  
you know we don't need it  
pretty much so that we'd be looking for the younger end  
yeah  
um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um  
yeah  
we we should assume it i that it is  
um in the i mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes <unk> you know more important here  
but when i start here  
yes  
remote control animal  
project process how do we think that went  
box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh  
wood wood would <unk> would give us a little bit of a marketing niche wouldn't it  
yeah  
but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or <unk> fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market  
yeah  
okay  
and um i have to access that as well  
but where  
yeah  
mm  
the remote control has big clear channel switching buttons  
so if we have a l. c. d. <unk> uh screen and uh not too many buttons  
no  
i've i've got another point  
yeah  
nips author always other nips author which are often themselves etcetera  
well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market  
perhaps that is one of the most uh  
yeah we we could yeah  
seems reasonable  
and uh also  
that's what i do when i need things that  
it would have to be 'cause pitch shifts yeah  
well this is life  
and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months because yeah  
hmm  
well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies  
yes  
uh-huh  
well we uh  
but um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but also on the older and will they use it if it only has an l. c. d. screen  
hmm  
but still there there's an opportunity  
that would be like if we use something like the space material or the l. c. d. screen things like that  
excellent  
yeah  
um and nothing else  
yes i do  
i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea  
yeah but yeah but um it uh it it failed right when you load it right the nite x. m. l. kit so that's interesting  
right my name's adam <unk> we're here because of real reaction um we have in the group  
or do i need to use more colours and  
well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it <unk>  
so you would have a set of keywords the set of image label with keywords and he has a set of <unk> image with some  
yes i al i i hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it  
okay  
and the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do  
uh  
maybe this  
to something which is maybe more universal  
just um if it's her i just caught the end of it and  
okay  
so but it's a matter of choosing which ones you need to do  
yeah  
and they they are not related then to other blocks of  
and uh okay i think we made some good progress here  
yeah maybe maybe two  
so we have break  
is that quite easy to do to get um a moving cursor  
yep  
okay  
so you end up yelling at the control for hours  
just 'cause it is an electronic device the  
um well another question uh the remote control is durable  
okay  
so you can open uh three  
wait a minute it's not it's not double curved it's single curved right  
um  
yeah  
yeah the toggle on off switch it's really appealing  
but  
you know something like that  
yeah  
so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory  
yeah yeah  
okay so it depends if uh  
you can have <unk> four kind of push buttons  
yeah  
there we go  
different languages  
it's more <unk> <unk> comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat  
mm okay  
i mean i think this part of the r. c. uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons i guess  
yeah  
well it's just a choice  
yeah you you could do a colour change  
'kay  
yeah two  
um about speech recognition  
freaky  
oh  
um looking like a scroll but it's really a push button technology excuse my spelling  
or maybe four  
right  
<unk> that's all  
yep  
i mean what functions do they have  
um current remote controls they don't match the user <unk> well as you'll see on the next slide  
oh  
um in the same order as last time  
or no we are not sure  
so that basically was don't bother basing too much of your general calculation on it  
it i don't know we'll we we will try uh we don't really know what uh will happen with this prototype  
so it's probably feasible  
yeah  
okay  
you know the sound and everything it's just one system  
yeah i think i will go without without it right  
i dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that  
so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky  
complex  
and we could  
on the other hand  
so that you know it <unk> it still has batteries on it in it  
um so a few of the requirements we need here  
okay  
so so we come to a decision  
words in varying sizes representing the probability of that topic for example  
um it's also true that she has quite a lot of files for most of the the projects actually that we manage  
um and i think that's all i had to say for that  
actually maybe it doesn't actually matter  
yeah  
i like that  
okay  
but i do think uh the <unk> uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery  
it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there  
thank you  
how many second and third year  
this is not old but start this is how you this is how you you start it off  
uh not running i mean to say <unk> probably uh he should run it or uh like we can <unk> help him to run it actually  
so imagine that we've just added a piece to the construct alright  
so it's total of three meetings and for the others the tendency and i <unk> 'cause you know i was when i was doing re scoring  
the only thing that well the thing that's holding <unk> me slightly up is um checking whether joe's <unk> finished that there i there is a working um model builder  
but that we can figure out i mean if it's going horrendously wrong  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder  
problem with connectors  
<unk> maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like  
i've gotten mm hardly any  
mm  
okay so so we keep all these all these buttons  
right  
manual controllers eh  
mm-hmm  
no  
there was some burning  
and the third one is what you <unk> uh that is not a <unk> fruit look  
yep  
next time i'm working on this uh g. d. f. stuff um so so i've i've i <unk> uh put on a d. t. d. and a sample x. m. l. file on the <unk> for the g. d. f.  
of course  
but  
yeah yeah yeah  
um i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an l. c. d. display it's it's nice  
i am your project manager and uh yeah i'm just here to  
so we need to have particular encryption codes  
hmm  
mm yeah but it's a it's a it's a different linear prediction model isn't it  
well uh that that was just through sheer weight of content though  
we should wait  
another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side  
put it like this  
i don't think you can probably do much more than what's already been achieved  
plus maybe half <unk> five  
yeah  
and you place them  
twenty five euros yeah  
thirty minutes  
yeah  
lines  
yeah uh but they don't have enough to make unique  
okay  
right  
yeah  
if you got a vector that says what the topics are say you've learned from p. l. s. a. a <unk> a distribution of topics for every page  
yeah  
different  
yeah but we would throw a lot away that are quite good  
okay  
it's <unk> no problem  
that's just broad band isn't it  
yes  
yeah okay  
yeah  
um we're like the requirements said we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience  
okay  
yeah yea  
yeah yeah  
maybe it's another way of doing that  
ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice <unk> voice recognition included on their remote control  
yeah if it's already on segments base that's not too much  
i think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh  
the one on top  
oh  
it's  
yeah  
okay  
but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing  
she already knows  
oh yeah  
and some people propose a scroll button  
then you're  
because  
so  
definitely  
okay  
that's that is the next step there's technology and then there is technology which we're moving into the next phase  
good idea  
yeah  
in an apart uh  
huh  
right  
but it's also annoying  
or like apply more  
cheaper option  
that's pretty much what people are accustomed to aren't they  
so what about you brian  
oh so it  
'kay  
yeah i think that should just be a simple led or something  
i'd say that too  
very good  
uh  
that's squishy  
but i mean if you  
but uh lots of devices already use infrared  
yes  
yep  
we need the explicit information about each meeting then  
exactly  
<unk> they're <unk> they're not trendy  
and then  
so all the words on this page were english but it was very very clearly a french page  
so um  
okay here it is  
yeah  
scroll wheel  
because he's now have a scroll wheel that you can push in  
no  
yeah okay  
so  
okay  
so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first  
mm  
anything else we need to do  
i'm very dis  
and again we have another another great marketing tool  
uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button  
right  
uh a new approach  
i guess it's completely other approach  
well we picked rubber right  
makes sense  
but it's also displaying uh a <unk> version in you know like below the below the graph the part  
yeah yeah but maybe you <unk> yeah yeah maybe <unk> you do but i've never heard of it in the first place  
um  
yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so we're thinking of like maybe just storing it on a per utterance level  
mm <unk> yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
you will see uh  
i'm not dissatisfied with it  
so it can't be that  
only thing that we worked through past each other  
yeah  
the idea is to have uh <unk> <unk> uh information  
but i'm sure <unk> i mean remotes lie still i think like ninety nine percent of the time  
okay um i guess the same thing again i started with something very basic  
i will go next  
yeah  
yeah  
yep  
excuse me  
yeah i haven't looked at this stuff much at all  
mm-hmm  
oh i've got some other things i couldn't fit onto this presentation  
sorry i didn't get that  
yes but uh i i <unk>  
yeah  
it's it's just a an extra function and it's cheap  
okay  
they just use the device  
so what's the size of the device  
well this is comfort  
thank you  
so um i mean we'll we'll get that back on track  
and the t. v. set uh also <unk> the the the signal and performs the assigned task  
we uh <unk>  
yeah  
have you looked at that  
so that's the final product without the speakers i guess  
to user interface design  
so you're advising <unk> <unk> that he should be using like any <unk> and <unk> content that um d. f. k. i. and t. n. o. bank in the c. v. s. repository or or not  
yeah  
okay  
but i'm not sure  
oops  
mm-hmm  
okay so it's just a bee  
this is the presentation boards <unk> which one i'm using right now  
yeah yeah  
see  
mm  
right  
yeah <unk> one of the <unk> key point is solar cells  
mm-hmm  
ah okay cool  
yeah  
it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about well this would be cool that would be cool  
because it's on <unk> legs and it uh but it can really overcome harsh terrain  
i didn't know was edible  
no that's not true  
not double anymore  
oh  
um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else  
'kay  
oh yeah  
yeah that's true i think  
yeah  
why not  
uh  
i it will look a bulky in that case  
um remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer fancier more exciting they're sick of this boring  
yeah  
yeah  
so that's what i'm saying that there is we could make it that a flag couldn't we  
i've done it  
simple push button  
yeah  
with the other we can do the the channel the volume et cetera  
retire to my lair and finish the report  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
okay  
just like a a phone  
mm  
yeah we have a problem yeah  
at the moment it's it's just lines of  
the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which <unk> admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value 'cause we were thinking  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
so my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that i would wish to to make a really functional product  
'kay  
we're  
and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting  
ugly  
mm  
the polygon one polygon two whatever it might be  
well  
yeah  
because you say there's no correlation now  
<unk> so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting  
i  
yeah  
it's a two  
yes of course  
okay  
yeah but i'm afraid i only have <unk> and <unk> doesn't have the nice x. m. l. viewer anymore  
uh okay  
alright  
so it's kind of logarithm when you use logarithm for m. f. c. c. <unk> right  
okay  
pictures was a was a bad word but  
but i think uh  
yep  
yeah  
true is one false is seven  
yeah mm  
well with the uh three  
yeah if we decide to uh to implement that maybe we should  
so actually it is there but it's just not <unk> ready there  
and then some could be reused some could be recycled and i think that would be very important for products now  
so you gotta decide which of those is more important to them  
so we have the basic channels we've got here uh the power button  
okay  
we can uh uh well you can save a file  
right  
<unk>  
yeah that uh-huh  
so those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty  
that's over on the interface if if you could put  
okay  
no we'd uh just said we didn't uh  
so see you after lunch break  
'cause in the information seeking dialogues the uh <unk> roles of the two participants are different  
hmm  
well for me personally i have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle i don't like to use them  
they want something that looks nice that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it  
yeah  
what you mean by that  
yeah  
one to seven what do you think  
taste  
so as we say before i think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing  
it's yeah but it i don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere  
yeah sure  
in order to make fifty million euros and you're only getting twelve and a half each  
so  
you know so it's you <unk> hold it in your hand like that i with you know and fiddling with the buttons  
glow in the dark material i was thinking  
okay  
well yeah  
i like i'll help talk  
actually  
yeah  
i mean it's a high band width standard  
well i mean we could make a yeah  
everybody's worked for the the company for a while if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do  
yeah you don't want it too small  
yeah but <unk> <unk> we want to design a new one  
oh is  
<unk> oh i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control  
you have the <unk> the bulb  
we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff  
you don't find the same title in the slides  
well as far as i <unk> as far as i know  
mm  
it's not hard the metal  
participant two  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
we only have  
interesting idea  
uh i'll see you in half an hour  
some of the <unk> they already provide this service so we can just use the service available  
no it's not one of our option but when you look in the market when you look  
whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices where you just shake the device and it gives it power  
we had to drop this and that just that you know  
mm  
that would also be nice  
jog dials are much easier than that  
yeah the technology's okay  
um  
don't think so  
i thought uh well  
hmm  
if you  
they really very faint  
mm  
yeah  
and um instead of colours and <unk> colour options they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design  
it's not even one g. b.  
i i think we can make a decision about that later  
so i think but th do you agree th that <unk>  
yeah  
we could let's say we have an l. c. d. screen people want an l. c. d. screen  
and the the volume control and program control maybe  
marketing experts  
i mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff  
that's project dependent as well  
so um yeah well that's yeah  
um that pretty much sums up the last one  
you could have your company badge and logo  
do you want 'em to roll it like that  
yeah that counts  
that's just gonna tell you where in the span you wanna be  
i was try i was thinking moving your thumb like this what does that remind me of  
yeah exactly  
i was still uh i was still working on this uh twenty five euro price point because i think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there  
i'm participant two  
is it plan  
i'm gonna erase my name there  
what time do we have to deliver the report  
yeah  
i think sometimes it's just shoved under under a cushion and yeah  
okay  
yeah age <unk> below forty  
yeah yeah just you just put the controller here then you  
yeah  
and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea  
mm yeah  
yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys  
yeah  
why not  
will give you the idea that is it okay like  
so it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh  
yeah  
the the cons the the two that we are going to <unk> the discourse structure might be <unk> different  
what kind is it  
okay  
that's costly though  
mm okay  
how much time do we ha we have left uh  
yes  
yeah  
round button in the middle or square one  
yeah  
right  
you can flip it up to there if you want  
so uh i didn't know what uh  
let's just cross everything out  
'kay okay  
yeah we're done  
come on  
but but do we want the curved uh uh design or  
right and then project documents  
yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non remote control looking remote control  
mm-hmm  
um  
try that again  
yeah  
it was a privilege working with you  
mm  
mm-hmm  
um  
project is evaluated  
and the pens  
um also in contra uh in contrast to last year the feel of the material is expected to be spongy  
thanks very much  
yeah  
uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing if you shake it  
okay  
let's see  
so uh 'cause i've we've been been working on trying to get the x. m. l. stuff working  
yeah yeah  
yeah but it's it's just the g. d. f. specification page on the uh on the <unk>  
okay yeah  
we  
what is the normal material  
how to detect that it's the same people  
she's very hard on this  
yeah  
and uh it must be easy to use  
and if the time stamps are on a word level then we <unk> somehow have to extract time stamps for utterances where they start  
logo also on  
thank you  
okay  
yeah  
yeah but you make also um segment similarity i think that was i i thought that would  
alright  
<unk> sure sure  
mm-hmm  
it seems to be the opposite as before  
yeah  
the the the financial aspect were okay  
oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yes  
yeah  
so then i continued with uh another uh paper that you are mentioning l. p. trap  
yeah  
like what to use so that it sounds the best  
yeah  
yeah  
but it's so we do have removable covers right  
yeah  
are they  
you lose track of it and you suddenly wonder why that value is zero  
and that might be just another way of saying try to target most people  
i didn't receive it yet  
oh  
yeah  
i think  
it's kind of like eighties neon style  
mm-hmm  
so that yeah  
okay  
i'm afraid i'm with steph  
um  
so it always means whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage  
mm yeah  
maybe once we can make a special edition in according with chiquita  
okay okay  
yeah alright it's it's handy to know  
um well i i think other than <unk> getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it  
<unk>  
it's <unk> it resembles the animal drawn by  
think we need an extra button here of course for yeah like you had for the  
yeah  
a dolphin  
yeah  
maybe but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it  
so you think it won't cost an  
sorry  
um to change the channel either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down  
hmm  
okay is that where people are leaning then the potato  
okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume  
um i'm assuming that we already have one but for the purposes of this meeting i i wasn't offered a  
but it's something to keep in mind  
okay  
yeah hold on a minute  
this is our functional design meeting  
yeah think so too  
now  
why the curves  
well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on  
mm mm-hmm  
product documents  
spongy  
okay  
yeah i  
um  
you shake it  
every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices  
so <unk> i think all evaluation should take that into account and look at the whole aspect set  
is there anything else  
cable camera  
i th i just read the rest of the sentence  
yeah  
so four point three point five it means it's acceptable  
yeah  
would we want by self intersection you mean you could  
<unk> the <unk> it's really another issue like  
yeah yeah  
i don't know  
i'd go with three or four maybe three  
that's it you just put it on the board  
like yeah maybe you can try to reduce  
i'm designing the user interface  
uh so you might not need that  
just uh yeah  
yeah but we're gonna make it yellow uh red and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now  
here  
i would make it a two or something  
yeah yeah  
because uh for a low energies there is usually noise  
and then i can just like repaint a small area or something  
okay  
i mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least  
yeah i can okay  
freely accessible for me  
yeah  
um  
okay so welcome everyone  
yeah  
okay  
yeah because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh x. d. k. and that's in  
and stereo uh <unk> uh audio installations  
um so this is <unk> number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria  
<unk>  
and the case is curved on one side but then flat flat so it's flipped into each other  
okay  
according to you no according to you designers how will feel does it uh with l. c. d. and without l. c. d.  
yeah <unk> uh i know about this since it's my it's exactly my field so  
to video  
sure  
well it'd be nice to it would be nice to really see what this what you're a actually trying to reconstruct here  
oh right  
okay  
mm  
well <unk> <unk> <unk> you don't have it like this  
it doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me but maybe for a spanish for i for  
um well we were told that it was not really possible to build walls but we noticed that this room actually has two doors  
double curved  
what are all these commas doing in here  
mm  
well i think keeping it  
so pretty just just the basic button functions  
where does the pen go  
so what was what was this <unk> <unk>  
uh i have look at the demo film and it's about uh  
just <unk> could everybody sort of start from that  
interesting  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
really  
yeah but after i mean it may be more like a guy um i <unk> i in an interface a guy interface  
yeah  
so you're two  
i dunno that's a question to you and to mm to  
and if in doubt um don't filter stuff out keep it in right  
okay but there are in uh in a plan  
and i think i there are many possible things with uh <unk> clustering  
yes  
mm-hmm  
mm uh  
um so  
no but according to this directory yeah  
i think that's important  
yeah sure yeah  
mm  
so just waiting for the batteries for that  
so it it takes a little time  
uh as you know i am mister <unk>  
have a dash  
<unk>  
and if you think about easy to use buttons we have to  
to guide <unk> uh i think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work  
and we've decided not to use l. c. d.  
yeah yeah  
i'm gonna plug in here real quick  
yeah  
i think i have to start  
um so the method we looked at existing designs what are the what's good about them  
so um actually that could like really cut down your thing so you've got your outside which is like minimalist  
or just background noise  
uh and it would actually be great if it was liz because i think she is the one who did the dialogue act segmentation automatic  
in use both battery as casing  
it ho <unk> uh hopefully that's yeah i guess it's that's why i <unk>  
no the first one that you sent like i didn't <unk> that it was a joke and i was like why did she send this to us  
did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t. v. well and based on your  
yeah that's right  
yes  
well it has a um a nice colour uh well compared to food but we didn't uh  
it's different  
<unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i know but  
so this seems to be the main problem as far as as i understand  
i guess we should do it just for one kind  
we would lose this one  
that's just something i think i think it's great yeah great idea  
yeah  
yeah there is there's index files already  
okay straight to trends and then we can discuss it all at once  
so anyway  
and it does have attributes that other products do  
uh-huh  
i think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters  
so it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the <unk> what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard t. v. thing  
i think that goes against the whole fancy something a new line but worth a shot  
yeah  
cool  
mm  
yeah  
um  
but a. <unk> but a an a. an a. g. n. is a class  
alright  
okay so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for  
and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote  
maybe even li like this with uh <unk> uses of a lot of space  
okay  
we've mostly been talking about the experiment schedule  
but  
right  
uh <unk> but i but the single curved is just oh  
yeah  
it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is <unk> i is down here for the uh l. e. d.  
no  
so  
well  
so that's a thing that has to be solved  
probably  
i mean it's it's an habit we have  
yeah  
'cause all you wanna know is whether they were looking at the same object in the period after  
so all the um individual components could be easily separated  
silly  
um we can use this board again i think  
mm-hmm  
okay so now we are here at the functional design meeting  
yep yep  
'kay there we go  
and then uh we'll see  
yeah okay that's that's what i'm gonna write <unk> between now  
yeah  
right  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah it's got a lot in there  
mm-hmm  
i was thinking though if it was glow in the dark you could put the um real reaction symbol as glow in the dark and then it would be constantly advertised  
mm  
i i think it's <unk> because it has fairly high level of inside links between  
cool  
yeah but the speaker if the speaker is actually on the chip then if it's too far away from the the casing  
does that look like it  
what are you i don no idea so  
yeah that that should be enough shouldn't it  
okay  
and uh in this in this the begin and end the number is the for example the end is zero dot twelve twelve is uh this frame too yeah  
we thought it was more for the the calm of the the people  
please  
but it's the same lyman alpha forest systems again  
so in there we have technical functions presentation working design presentation and the functional requirements  
and uh in that case for example the few words mm that you that you get more can make the difference  
now i think alex um s. d. r. s. allows both kinds  
shall i go uh next  
maybe we can just uh  
double curved you can't do titanium  
oh what did i just do  
what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design  
yeah  
all set  
right  
yep  
um  
but it'd be nice if you didn't because then i mean that's well  
we're back online  
yeah  
if uh 'kay <unk> if we do if we use one then we'll have just a switch on it  
for visually impaired yeah  
shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers because it's kind of an idea of our own  
yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice  
the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts so they can remove it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end  
just if you are really lonely maybe  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
but is it uh is fruit cool  
uh we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components  
and the speech recognition 'cause i think we're definitely going for the speech recognition are we  
i mean i do spend time talking to you guys  
that have lots of text on them  
yeah i agree  
this must be the okay button used to uh interact with the l. c. d. screen  
yeah  
that's it  
yellow  
that's right  
<unk> the one we collected last year  
this one is really comfortable like i like the sides whatever because  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's uh  
oh  
and i'm sure i believe you  
hmm  
right from the start of the day  
mm no  
perhaps they decide <unk>  
we have no more than this  
like should we do both  
um but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well  
okay  
mm  
i want gold plating  
is are you okay with that  
um  
so we have to think of that  
yeah everyone got enough input i think  
yeah  
so we will get back th on that  
uh well the uh all the functions are discussed uh i think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious  
so  
a menu button maybe  
it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control  
mm  
or just what they like their sports team or whatever  
okay that's quite good  
yeah maybe but atlas you'd have thought it'd be quite high  
so now  
oh yeah i guess t. v. can be stressful yeah if you're watching sports  
you know to process that  
i mean nokia they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy  
yeah  
um  
yeah yeah yeah  
well is it uh okay i'll just go through your system then  
oh but that was about what task the person doing the browsing was gonna do  
um okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one  
oh  
oh we'll do we wa  
yeah  
alright yeah no this i this is good so through all that we've we go we're right  
and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day  
so darren software  
hmm  
is it sorry could i <unk> use that  
i'd give it a one  
with a pen than with a mouse mouse  
so i think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a <unk> and spinning thing  
that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered  
they've both got the same sound card  
like <unk> around two hundred <unk> uh hertz and you take a look on the signal  
yeah  
and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever because they are used very rarely and well  
i mean i uh i'm sure they could have probably had university of edinburgh host it or whatever  
okay  
um  
can i just check  
yeah because when you're watching t. v. you're zapping and you have to put it in a <unk> and i don't think it  
okay  
widths  
that vibrates  
so for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing uh expert uh anna and um  
okay  
so all the <unk> <unk> <unk> of these are here  
and i don't know whether they're gonna spend more time looking at one or the other  
yeah  
and so there  
about thirty one and then invert that it's  
i cannot generate <unk>  
four sevens  
but uh it's not a big tragedy  
we could just say outright anyone in their third year or anyone in their second or third year  
yeah da  
so i think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks  
mm-hmm  
ah beautiful  
there's a lyman limit which you could see and then there's a slight depression near it  
uh festival is good like now it comes at all the linux boxes also so in so already in this  
that is for are we are we picking one particular series at the moment  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
<unk> but you this is just a large <unk> large television  
so  
know what you're doing  
so we see that running along with playing  
well i suppose what we can do is think about the structure now and say right what's the maximum we can do  
so i'll move on to i guess my last slide yes which is the closing  
<unk> <unk> speech is very difficult to <unk> sort of judge on quality compared to voiced i think  
hmm  
so it can't work uh yeah exactly  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah i suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple  
but this is the signal which we get from one di one frequency band  
that's not true  
do you have assistants with professors  
yeah yeah  
but  
so it just depends what you think about these ideas and if i'm yeah maybe kate you better say what you think about them  
oh  
yeah it works yeah  
get better and uh i think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah  
yes  
so we uh agreed upon uh <unk> uh well not <unk> unanimously or how you call it but yeah  
okay so in for the case um  
six  
that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a <unk> or um keep replacing the batteries  
okay  
okay  
smart  
we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction  
yes  
yes  
so i i everybody knows what <unk> is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the <unk> of of your your own uh uh favourite animal  
or we have to delete this one or  
um we agreed that the colour should be <unk> uh yellow and black  
minus  
yeah  
right  
think so  
so what about the clapping technique  
why adjustable  
well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype  
hmm  
let's continue to uh to the real stuff  
amen  
so  
see  
what does the screen do  
yeah  
see what our roles are in this project  
yes  
yeah  
i don't know if that's the correct word  
so  
i gave a disc a a presentation  
yeah  
if that if we did use a hinge or if it was just two parts and then you'd have  
function f. eight  
so yeah  
but this one includes this feature right  
that would have been a thrill  
it wasn't it wasn't a bug  
yeah so it's kinda  
it's a bit um phallic  
uh-huh  
five  
'cause otherwise you might risk cutting bits off  
and the ease of use remote control with uh the less <unk> possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons  
it has to be re it has to be really to with respect to this this clustering makes sense or i dunno  
<unk> digital pens  
let's see  
mm-hmm  
yeah and a and a triangle on that  
what's it called  
'kay  
just uh press uh yeah  
so  
so we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people  
uh okay  
for english it's especially low  
please norman draw uh  
<unk> uh  
otherwise not  
like extended as as more as much as possible to keep the okay  
yes <unk>  
yeah  
shall we do that then  
that's the that's the big thing  
yeah you can  
yeah  
keep the flip live  
okay  
yeah  
simba  
let me pose again the question very clearly  
okay  
in which folder  
i think you're right there as well  
<unk> that would that would make it  
for the bear  
so we want it to be universal  
there is uh i think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control  
well i think we both wanna send <unk> well i don't know maybe you've already done this but i you know  
what do you think about uh incorporating <unk> or a radio uh receiver uh in the place holder next to the t. v. connected to the t. v.  
because people will hang around whereas people are more likely to go off somewhere for lunch aren't they  
oh no  
exactly  
oh my god  
yes because the walls they they reflect the infrared light  
mm-hmm  
okay  
and additionally we're <unk> maybe not supporting teletext um  
uh um they use it  
it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future it can come  
i'll see you back here in thirty minutes  
three buttons channel up channel up down and  
and <unk> yeah <unk> what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials  
so hamed can you  
hmm  
yeah yeah  
because i i don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control  
um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast colour and  
and it yeah this is gonna <unk> you know handy to use  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
it was it was uh a personal effort of <unk> that decided to do it  
but maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell  
if you were watching something would you sort of be wanting  
fine  
<unk>  
i can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall  
this is twice as important as the next finding which is technologically innovative  
if <unk>  
leadership teamwork  
um and then yeah  
pink  
okay  
mm-hmm  
not in mine  
yeah mm yeah maybe  
but then did click note and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it or something  
the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control so those they those have to <unk> be find very easily  
actually have at the whole thing  
well put it there  
uh and the technology's already available  
mm  
a one  
oh format  
hmm  
<unk>  
so i was thinking that uh um a really simple  
oh full screen yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
well <unk> <unk> i think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing it it would work right  
yeah it's kinda fruity and with th with catchy colours uh uh <unk>  
that also means in the <unk> new parts list they're there for you know two <unk> large triangles and two small one small ones say  
yeah or or when you use the buttons as black it you can use two colours as well uh  
okay  
but  
mm mm  
well they're not supposed to be green or whatever colour this is  
okay  
um yes  
okay  
yep  
it's pretty flexible in the yeah price  
<unk>  
it's the fat cat okay  
if we do that  
and i'll get this one uh in digital uh form too  
yeah uh <unk> can be interesting to do  
we're <unk> in good circumstances  
plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a t. v.  
and there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great  
well it can be a problem sometimes but most of the time it works okay  
yeah i know  
mm-hmm  
right  
so if you can dock it um you know you could <unk> argue that this is  
right  
maybe you know maybe like still in the shape of a banana  
so whatever we should be able to <unk> you know backtrack and say okay instead of every second every tenth of a second or some such thing  
but what we are interested in is people  
yeah got the email  
sorry  
yeah  
the sub band signal  
oops  
and uh not <unk> all the the the the stuff you can do with it but uh the the essential stuff is there  
if you go on to the next slide  
okay  
uh well these are two uh remotes and that's our uh our dilemma i think  
um jasmine uh um what is um the text you're extracting uh looking like then at the end  
yeah  
yeah and yeah most th th they want to spend money for a better system for better remote control  
mine will always read copy of something or other  
mm-hmm  
no if you on most t. v. <unk> if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other <unk> it yeah  
so i thought well i mean obviously if he wants to finish off then you know  
i mean it they they fall a lot  
<unk>  
yeah we can <unk> or uh also <unk> we we can make one we can still make  
if wasn't in there then you'd have it silicone two lines at but without with the i think that means silicone two derived from these two features  
yeah  
so you have up and down for the for the channels and left and right for the volume uh  
it's older generation they're the ones that have gone out and  
probably think you want the curve to be here  
i think we yeah i think that's okay  
okay  
and all the students and guillaume wa was a student of this class was very excited uh to design such a table  
hello  
why did it so we mark  
um  
um if we need to rethink anything at all  
so let's come back to that one  
it's not going to be easy  
yes  
uh  
it also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would  
so if you have any questions  
i yes  
yeah  
and uh uh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we're kind of like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have  
so maybe button a. is the power button okay  
does something which tells you how specific a word is  
yeah  
it's more like a pseudo face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it  
um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because <unk> our target is only like twelve point five euros and  
and what do you say our industrial expert  
yeah  
gray yeah  
or did the  
it's not something i need to <unk> push through but i thought should we thinking more about the dimensions  
we will get information and then we'll come back in  
accessible from your thumb yeah palm held and all the  
but the problem is and then she will go back and there's uh <unk> family issues and all these things you know  
can't draw  
you go into the little menu on the l. c. d. screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want  
i don't know if there is study about that  
alright shall we get back to work  
my job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
oh so well i can imagine there being uh shapes that you could construct in s. v. g. format that would fox the model builder in some way  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
up to three for that because i'm haven't seen the weight so i must not uh colour and shape  
okay  
mm-hmm  
one one being true and seven being false  
and some way the statistical independence i think it can be a good explanation to show why it is happen even if it is <unk>  
yeah but it's so  
yeah  
okay  
all it does is do this this stupid data format conversion  
oh well it doesn't  
that's great  
mm-hmm  
yeah so i <unk> i uh yeah  
so  
the slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie  
yes 'cause it ta it takes an image  
then you say it's it's a shot  
and moreover it it has um l. c. d. and everything so that uh you know uh we <unk> the pressing of the buttons anyway  
we don't have as much time as i thought  
i dunno some kind of alarm  
that's think enough  
only all the drawings go there at the left uh  
so basically  
the  
well no i think that's about it  
yeah  
kinetic yeah  
zoom  
um hmm  
another beep to stop the meeting  
i know that batteries last long nowadays  
um for limited <unk> or limited <unk> uh lexical recognition it's very  
yeah  
uh we're missing weak weak line  
it should feel strong  
it is  
okay we could do that  
right  
it's difficult  
um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote so probably if you have like one  
corporate colour  
yeah  
it's still it's still working and your daughter got a bonus  
um  
so you don't want it to break  
okay  
i thought that was the whole beauty that like you can just make a new x. m. l. file and sort of tie that to the other and and it <unk>  
so sorry i was just gonna say what was the question for this  
and uh user <unk> is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key  
yeah  
and uh that's it  
like to make it different fruits  
yeah yeah that's special colours sure  
yeah it will  
prototype presentation well first you guys built the prototype  
uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other  
they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing  
oh you wanna go back  
and i think that's if we're gonna make a remote control it should actually work for what it's doing  
sorry  
and so i think we should invite them but then we've still got the problem of uh a priority issue  
this okay you <unk> we tried we tried  
okay what do we do about that  
and <unk>  
so some technical functions  
i just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it  
um  
so if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the  
if we all just went out and bought useful things i don't think i mean that's not what technology  
and you can't just bring extras in case you screw up  
so i will open our functional design meeting  
it's too uh  
um  
yeah  
or one of these glottal pulse things  
where am i  
then we probably can't yeah  
okay  
so when you say a red nut or a green bolt or a long green bolt then there'll be lots of them lying around  
i'm kendra and i'm the us user interface designer and um i haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but i'm <unk> so i'll be  
the creative genius  
so  
what are your experiences  
yeah  
'kay um  
i made your animal for you  
i don't think that was the best way but  
i'll do that today or tomorrow  
yeah  
and since i also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them  
mm  
yeah sure  
yeah  
you you have the <unk> running somehow  
right  
mm yes  
five  
uh position i presume that just means  
if it's small if it's fits if if people like it why not  
yeah  
no that's no  
okay  
no no no they again  
agree  
yeah  
so maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something  
yeah  
yeah screen settings audio settings teletext settings you have  
and it's bad  
okay but now you don't have that  
yeah  
right  
oh  
when you uh put on remote you see a kind of a just like when you telephone you see a little uh animation  
uh-huh  
afterwards some uh  
um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh  
so it looks quite good i think  
so well we're under the the the cost  
uh  
okay  
right  
exactly yeah for <unk> and yeah  
so  
okay one device  
mm  
so let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design  
yeah  
yeah okay but i don i do i think <unk> that's because  
so it should be relatively easy to at least this is the last news i had and then i can try to get him back  
no  
no not yet  
yeah  
four  
close enough  
i think between the two somewhere between the two is true  
and let us see what the market demands  
and i uh is it through <unk> <unk> uh l. d. a. or something  
next week  
but what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though  
yeah  
i <unk> i have dictionaries  
well right away i'm wondering if there's um th th uh like with d. v. d. players if there are zones  
but i don't think it's <unk> wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well  
okay let's have our buttons all be one colour  
are we restricted by this  
if i know i uh i think i sort of know a little bit like what you guys were <unk> uh doing right  
okay well  
mm 'kay  
that's possible  
and then after that we can make the user uh inter interface  
exceed our uh our uh production uh  
um and they're clearer when um your goals are quite limited  
so at this stage i mean is this the last meeting of the project  
well that's the thing  
um we need to come up with some specifics of the components um the materials  
mm-hmm  
do you have anything you you came up with yet  
'kay um  
'kay  
right  
ye ye yeah  
but also we should take care that in fact m. m. m. it's in m. m. m. data video browser and this is accessible from outside  
mm  
the first one is yeah i will call that a.  
if you press a button and you can disable the the colour <unk> for for people that don't like it  
um thing  
no no no  
you'll be working poppy will be working on the look and feel design  
mm  
cool  
but th um this is properly part of the action coding  
then then then you should do everything in the menu  
<unk> uh well um functional design um  
like so  
so if we could figure out uh if they are really <unk> uh interacting with each other or just uh uh incremental mm presentation of some information  
uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that  
no it isn't  
okay i have some uh points from marketing point of view  
so then i think maybe i can give it two  
no two  
actually <unk> fifty per cent means that she's there half time uh generally in the mornings  
yeah i <unk> would then just not print out the um start and end times  
yeah in fact they distributed the whole thing around  
oh evaluation  
nah i think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext  
t. v. is more like fifteen years maybe so  
just by <unk>  
so  
you know say hello to and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice  
i think  
it can be interpreted as a kind of focus of interest  
we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls people do not like remote controls  
um you haven't heard from him i take it either  
so that we just use simple <unk> no but but  
we're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half euro per unit  
ha has a c. d. burner though  
we can it's a <unk> a kind of vegetable but you know we we integrated them with different colour  
i'm listening  
i don't know  
hmm  
uh no we'd have to look in their code and see what it actually does  
hmm  
mm  
so that's that's our end of things <unk> uh  
now that that was uh was the end  
so options and then you sub them  
yeah i do i don't think we need that for either of them you can do a banana in single curve yeah  
i think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect  
you know  
yep  
we'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close  
mm-hmm  
um you have a transmitter an input device logic chip you know stuff like that  
so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of  
okay then we <unk> okay well <unk> we don't have to do it but what that would just have a lack of key features you know  
yeah  
the positive things has to be on the left so i said not ugly instead of ugly  
uh our market really likes really likes that  
it wasn't that far back was it  
no can do  
actually if you can figure out a way like how basically a general way because there's at least two points at which we are interested in that  
or not  
yeah  
first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less  
so it's not in theory but i i can i can say yeah  
mm-hmm  
i didn't include it  
this is what that looked like literally just like that  
yeah peeling of the banana  
mm-hmm  
a command line where you obviously type things in and you get a response  
okay  
yeah okay but if you have a square uh l. c. d. screen  
thank you  
um i'm the project manager of this project and uh well i will tell you on what actually is the project  
mm-hmm  
then you uh you you then turn it and then the t. v. goes on  
so when they walk wherever they are going to put their first feet the second feet will always be  
and uh so we did a statistical test for that  
mm-hmm  
um i liked <unk> idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons  
okay  
yeah but we're gonna if it  
okay so maybe we should leave them out then  
uh about an l. c. d. screen uh and speech recognition  
yep  
okay  
i don't know what you feel  
alright  
they're like they're again training gaussian mixtures for different frequencies and then but they can they're following the yeah  
<unk> well let's go on maybe with the presentation  
oh we also need tho think about the energy  
okay  
like that  
right  
okay  
shall we <unk> well we'll stick to kind of your area for now  
are  
hmm  
um i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one  
yeah but what i've done is um a parser an x. m. l. parser where you can get the start times  
here  
alright  
a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen  
doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment  
right  
would that not happen at <unk> anyway even if they're in the <unk> like with the ones that have no words and then not have really low information density or something  
i think so  
lo uh yeah  
no signal  
are the buttons in special colour special <unk>  
um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and  
yeah  
because the the um  
mm  
we <unk> we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the t. v. so uh  
<unk>  
<unk> <unk>  
but it's easy to go if you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel  
a banana  
there is something wrong  
yeah  
you said seven  
yeah yeah  
okay  
yeah  
on the wednesday right  
not not uh the <unk> the watch kind th the most uh well it has to be simple and i <unk>  
and i and this and this is all on the record  
so <unk> is again different no  
that's right  
okay so no further uh information is here  
mm  
well satisfaction on for example are we satisfactory about our creativity  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
yeah  
mm  
yeah and  
mm  
you could make it just a regular scroll wheel  
can you maybe fix the other  
yeah  
i'll see if i can s. c. p. it i suppose  
yeah but uh you know  
i reckon a dwarf amorphous nuclei star burst galaxy a dance is a yeah okay  
hmm  
so so i would also say this is four  
uh <unk> this  
i mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire  
okay  
okay  
does it work  
so we might have to wait  
so let's not go for the  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so you you'd you'd also say that it shouldn't be part of the importance measure if there's no f. zero  
hmm  
but people are often enough looking at the help once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff  
so it's single curved  
but i in a sense i mean if we see uh yeah but like probably that would be the same thing that we also display up here  
um and that  
you know you know you have you had those balls you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes  
yeah  
just uh let them all uh stand here  
oh you always have in the centre an okay button for your menu  
um considering material um  
being open to technology  
yes  
<unk> it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical  
you have to make it new you have to make it state of the art  
does that break a joystick  
so it isn't useless  
no  
uh okay  
right  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i i don't know if there was a <unk> i th  
i well i think  
at least their names and if we have their names then we can get their email  
then put them with another researcher rather than two students  
let's go for our detailed design meeting  
oh  
yeah  
yep  
you have any further questions or  
right  
right okay so basically time to market seems to be important therefore speed of delivery  
something very basic  
but that's gonna be a problem 'cause you don't always have all left handers or all right handers in a family  
um just literally just metropolitan san diego i live like five minutes from the zoo  
special material  
okay  
components design  
ah there it's doing something  
yeah  
well um this we have  
so  
with the with the numbers and  
no okay  
um u. i. d. the technical functions design will will be worked on the next thirty minutes  
okay  
that is a <unk> <unk> feature  
we can probably just start with the java hash map and like just hash map over it and see how far we get  
i just don't see the cross over between computers and and and 'cause we are designing something for a television okay  
yeah it was a pleasure working with you  
and uh the trend watching  
yeah  
then they're small cute and furry and uh when planet of the apes becomes real i'm gonna be up there with them  
yeah yeah mm i don't know we'll have to i'll  
okay  
but it it's also for people they want to learn it fast not uh they want to  
no huh  
to push button yeah yeah  
the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side which closes the circuit here  
mm-hmm there  
okay  
cool  
no  
no  
you may see something like there is one <unk> which is uh very would have quite a <unk> right  
<unk> available there  
um and what people fashionable because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our t. v. i think  
now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve fifty per  
uh well my personal preferences here well we have to keep it simple  
think so too  
but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t. v. <unk> to use a remote control on  
yeah  
and uh okay  
<unk> <unk> kind of <unk> frighteningly accurate  
wow  
and <unk> on the topic of the technology  
yeah  
right  
mm-hmm  
they have tele teletext  
exactly  
yeah  
yeah sure  
mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time  
yeah  
yeah i know it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example okay  
but <unk> you can if you save this image you can open it in your shared work folder  
we can't make all uh ten designs  
yeah  
so uh so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project so um  
with uh w. w. dot google dot com  
thanks  
i think he said yes to that  
do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier  
but um this this second pass we should really try to catch all of them or at least most of th yeah  
yeah  
squeak squeak  
you are not answering my question  
we don't have the slogan though  
yeah you don't want you want uh yeah it it it must be a remote  
uh what the minimum fixation duration for a stable fixation would be sort of you have if it picks up <unk> <unk> less than say fifty milliseconds  
why this strange factor of seven  
or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure  
oh okay  
well i guess yeah i dunno  
yeah i think so  
yeah  
so um  
which would yeah turn it into something far more ordinary  
minimal number of buttons  
hmm maybe  
it is discussion time  
how what's the highest um ranked one that that kind of problem occurs with  
um well look at the expense sheet  
then oh yeah yeah yeah  
i'll i'll uh give you my report on friday or something  
uh they well they like more the they like the traditional materials like wood and and such more  
yeah  
okay so the the main <unk> uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh <unk> and  
yeah but we should make sure we finish that off because otherwise that work's just wasted right  
i don't know if this is uh still in time  
but yeah  
just say we want some web space  
alright let's have um well we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with  
right  
yeah yeah yeah  
but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design  
it really looks like a banana  
exactly  
thank you  
um from  
yeah well we can skip this part as well because i thought i read above forty so we could skip the features  
but they're they're creating a their a guy jonathan is creating a web form for you to do this all very simply and like just um <unk> everything that you've uh up <unk> the file that you've transcribed and and you'll be noting whether it's the first pass or the second pass and <unk> your name um as the person who did that particular pass  
yeah that yeah that interface and integration yeah  
no it you did better  
it it isn't the spectrum of the clouds  
we have five minutes to go  
no  
and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures but i didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily  
okay  
a sound question  
mm  
this one  
we need to stick to that  
and possibly discuss what we think about them but maybe should hear what kate has to say first  
yeah i think it's okay for both right and left  
and  
um under forty five years old  
lyman alpha forest you can point to on the spectrum  
very very basic yeah  
no this is the development phone this is not the commercial stuff with the software  
easy to use  
yeah  
there <unk>  
like <unk> on the type of filter or is it oh okay  
sponge  
deadlines were sometimes very short  
yes  
so you know that um  
yeah again the the fashion trends this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something  
um working on i  
yeah  
yes  
what  
okay  
yeah  
yeah with buttons  
uh  
it's um yeah exciting perfect true interesting exactly correct super and so on  
yeah  
yeah  
one's true  
uh yeah actually in fact i think it will be yeah  
oh you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your t. v.  
it it has to be fast  
what do you like  
they're inventing it they're creating the trend  
so i think this is probably special co no  
let's keep them  
mm  
okay  
no  
okay  
but  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
and at the moment that's definitely not a good thing to display if they're like an average ten ten utterances apart or something  
yeah maybe something like service <unk> or you could well you could <unk> actually look at the place holder you talked about earlier  
okay  
um  
um  
without phase  
rubber banana  
i just wanna 'cause basically i can't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name so i just wanna rather than going uh miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again  
rubber  
yeah it's because you have um <unk> um you have um <unk> different files  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and on so i'll just go up to the board do i have to keep this stuff on  
well i guess it's just a restriction we took  
yeah like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath  
uh what sort of shape do we want  
the the m. l. p. four and these things  
because to me it seems that everyone is still comparing to p. l. p. <unk> or m. f. c. c. <unk>  
right  
uh from yeah on the dialogue act level  
it was at d. b. f. l. yeah  
okay  
so now i'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control  
um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant  
we do we do got a market  
maybe you can <unk>  
yeah i  
uh the shape i shape is i  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
if you if you go to if you go to our uh view like you if you are in the sound system there  
mm  
my handwriting is little bit yeah  
yeah one i think  
we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it  
yeah  
yeah  
uh there is another pen  
yeah i suppose he can see that we're putting the work in  
or maybe it <unk> should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it  
yeah i was thinking just common a. a. cells  
it doesn't look like uh  
this is our conceptual design meeting  
mm-hmm  
no and which we will do very very shortly  
and then we we need to train the new rates because m. l. p. training needs to be done and then only the next step will happen  
not quite but almost  
yeah  
but i i have some good <unk> information about different ways how you can sort of weight two different factors  
so  
i think i if the line's too long <unk> you've highlighted all i as one  
yeah  
right right  
yeah  
and the way you transform it uh <unk> by the mouth  
mm-hmm  
it's um robust yeah  
okay  
okay  
alright  
yeah i think that would be really helpful  
no  
still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand right  
huh  
yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said  
i mean that's an obvious thing to say but it's not attached to the device that you want to control  
no i don't think so  
okay  
i'd give it a kinda middle of the road for  
yeah yeah we aren't gonna make it to our second cookie break  
oh my god  
so i rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour  
i'll show you this afterwards  
so are are poor little thing  
but all these things are usually in house so we don't have much problems  
so i'm going to be the project manager of this uh project  
it's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function  
hmm  
don't you think  
we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought  
so uh that's a pretty low rating i think  
the electrics um with a scroll push uh button we must use regular uh chips  
um gab gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things  
yeah  
um  
so the i intentional thing is when they actually both click on the same object and it breaks  
so um i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want  
yeah  
yeah  
ooh  
so in part i could i could give you some of my personal preferences but i could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research  
um i worried about the materials it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh  
hmm  
rather than real reaction  
and if you just have one document um it still can find out which words are informative for that category and which are not  
ben <unk>  
uh along with um looking less ugly if it looks better eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it  
true we're still not making it easier then  
um but i th uh i've i gave each part a start time and an end time um so you can see when the parts were created  
yeah we will yeah so i will be able to to summarize uh our meeting  
okay so they don't like the look of the remote control  
right so um apologies for the last meeting it was brought to my attention that i did not make the roles clear enough  
oh oh i think you ga  
um generally generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something  
i mean difficult huh  
and i think  
which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions  
so the tape is ta tape is at the end  
x. m. l. yeah  
yep  
but if you're zapping yeah  
um i'm craig and i'm user interface  
okay so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two  
rather this is a list of things to do as the checker  
yeah yeah  
it's quite long  
i say a two  
yep  
excellent  
no sorry  
yeah  
but the ultimate decision is on our side because we have to see how it does it work out with the poster session  
yeah that's true yeah  
yeah  
say it uh  
i guess  
but you can't <unk> your presentation from here i believe  
right  
up down  
okay so the average of that is  
yeah  
okay  
mm  
because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it <unk> kind of like sticks  
yeah that's that's yeah it is  
yeah  
uh we we think tim's program can do both of these conditions that you want  
mm-hmm  
but  
yeah  
again yeah i  
hmm  
and it will sell  
uh i suggest well what do i suggest actually  
but they're hardly in our areas  
um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed  
okay  
so if you have just one document in each category and there are a lot of um occurrences of the word the in each one  
you know dialogue <unk> unless you understand shared plans  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but you see the problem <unk> you can't continue your uh your line  
but even they don't believe like with one paper or two i guess because at least for them no p. l. p. <unk> or m. f. c. c. <unk>  
um i'm sure the little uh the little <unk> pop up any minute now  
that steph is your part is the user friendliness  
yep  
okay okay  
uh so  
no so they are going from <unk>  
yep  
okay um  
yeah yep  
we redesigned it  
at least that's what i have in  
<unk> do we agree on that  
or how do you <unk>  
so basically even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display  
but you know later on you could you can you know you also selling the potential of the device  
that's it  
volume  
would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like i dunno  
we have to  
<unk>  
okay excellent  
there it could have a stem like that 'cause i do <unk> kind of like the stem  
um and then yeah just <unk> um be sure after you've gone through the four channels to um do a search on all the unknowns  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yes yes you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it  
our uh group <unk> uh <unk> uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to  
user <unk> okay  
and so it's worth testing  
this is <unk> laptop so you can <unk> okay  
and uh friendly so size does matter  
yeah  
yeah  
it's it's part of the rubber i suppose  
uh oh  
mm-hmm  
ah purple  
and limit the design  
okay  
right  
we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money  
we are going to lose it some way if uh if we don't put some and very honestly yeah  
yeah  
think you uh picked the wrong uh function  
i mean i <unk> i don't expect to be that in depth  
mm  
so um hmm <unk> maybe it would be nice if you <unk> if you tell us uh what you do with the speech coding 'cause i <unk> i didn't see any of p. h. d. <unk> of you  
then uh there are different kind of chips one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an <unk> advanced chip  
any ideas  
mm-hmm  
have any of it i think  
<unk> um  
or <unk> or smelly  
yeah so can you go out to the shared folder  
mm-hmm  
uh we ha we have um single what  
and uh our idea is to uh  
some some big dots  
so  
it the all this l. p. c. stuff is  
uh maybe we can make uh it in five euros and even less than that because we want to have uh millions and in bulk  
there are twelve  
and then we'll put those things together  
but this was signal company no like  
you the the <unk> the buttons change <unk> <unk> their function depending if <unk> it's teletext or not  
and um we will once again have poppy as our first presenter  
dash c.  
why a dog  
uh do do because it's not like with microphone arrays where you would need micro second alignments of course  
too  
uh okay  
yeah i i need frequency as well  
uh <unk> what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh right help  
and then you could scale them both  
mouse is okay  
mm  
i uh once upon a time studied in victoria and i am the user interface designer  
yeah it's off  
but the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh i don't th if we're going for <unk> and silvers then i don't think we're  
integrating a scroll bar on this side  
so  
so <unk> <unk> would with have the spinning wheel inside with the l. c. d. or would it be on the outer  
um basically it's saying that  
so uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven  
maybe we can include that also  
what track  
<unk>  
so from  
yes  
alright  
mm  
mm-hmm  
instead of having um  
mm-hmm  
might as well think about  
now let's say  
well  
but idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two  
um  
but this is working in general  
yeah that doesn't count  
is it  
mm-hmm  
well you let's um encourage them not to use um any software that might have idiosyncratic ideas about what s. v. g. is  
but you're talking about the microphone array here  
form  
output hmm  
so wood  
but practically i don't think it's  
um  
we have to make it fashionable  
much longer  
especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population  
she would like see  
that's what you mean  
um  
so we can say we try to to make something for april  
so you know the sub mm like um more details  
um  
one small thing uh the added functions  
for now  
so it's not uh  
oh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
um  
okay  
but our budget we've yeah  
well it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so  
uh can i uh i say something  
uh well uh thirty minutes  
so what's the good that that uh the project gets out of this in the end  
uh what's the sample sensor  
we have under twelve euros fifty  
i have some ideas  
so we have the <unk> we probably have have on line in our in our system we have the ability to create this we're talking about  
and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be <unk> in the product such as the colour and <unk> the slogan  
okay  
they're they're jointly focused on this region and trying to figure out what <unk> percentage of time they're looking at it as adding new tiers of information to either the elan track or n. x. t.  
that's true  
going no we're gonna watch this you can bring out your own remote and be like zap no we're gonna watch this  
yeah i mean i wouldn't like to say you <unk> i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units  
hmm  
history  
right who's got experiences with remote controls then  
yeah it's it's really deep  
yeah  
okay  
so that's my presentation  
true  
like um no how many frames per per second you do have  
infrared here and this'll be the power point the on off button kind yeah  
yeah that was the eyes  
eighty per cent would  
<unk> yeah  
uh one  
there is th sorry an extra cost in that sense  
of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control <unk>  
yeah yeah  
true  
yeah  
yeah  
um r. s. i.  
we should make one that walks by itself  
yeah  
alright  
uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television  
mm-hmm  
that means you're constantly changing your production schedule and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else so that's not a good idea i would i would suggest  
so  
<unk> you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old  
yes in l. c. d. display  
mm-hmm  
did you really take uh take those in account  
uh but uh  
okay  
yeah  
so that's nine point one there so we've got some  
um soft and spongy have we achieved that  
<unk>  
i know  
that are not very informative but words that are only in one class are are very informative for that class  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but at the other hand uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand and  
sinusoidal based  
that done  
um you guys know me pedro and um  
standby options yeah  
oh dear  
now going back to the uh industrial design of it you know we were looking at whether to use maybe infra red or <unk>  
and then we have it's trunk  
i think that's a that's a good separation  
yeah i don't know if the they have that anywhere else though  
okay cool  
it's one to seven right  
well it's titanium looking  
with the scroll butt yeah and then say channel  
that's the point  
at least when the noise is uh at uh is bigger that uh specific levels  
we got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the <unk> of the buttons  
okay  
j. peg  
okay well i've  
which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points  
yeah yeah yeah  
save it okay  
yes we are  
yeah  
the what we  
<unk> maybe not huh  
you can  
yeah mi this might be interesting to see tomorrow  
technology  
so what that means is that um  
right right  
yeah there are full professors and assistant professors if you want  
we're not developing this product for a specific vendor are we  
okay just uh a last question um when you mentioned it  
uh are we gonna take triangles anyway  
we're already at five  
yeah  
and it could if it's that softer rubber material it'll be maybe um uh  
okay  
but it's such a basic sort of you look at a spectrum and you say that's a a soft excess it's a soft  
oh how did you  
mm  
but the main concept is um take one big touch screen  
<unk> band is g. s. m.  
right  
um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext only for t. v.  
it'd be nice if everything was wireless wouldn't it  
uh yeah it's less um what's th ha  
no  
so uh how long should a poster session be  
i don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically that's up to the design people but it is <unk> something worth thinking about  
okay so i'll remove it  
don't spend more than a day or two on it  
okay  
they are used to it actually  
sorry  
uh yeah all the trends and no colours uh anymore  
so it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons  
and then he came back with this whole criticism saying like oh  
oh my god it works  
okay okay okay okay okay  
okay  
okay  
okay  
so i it should kind of fit in as well and the stereotype of a yeah  
yeah  
wheel  
yeah  
regarding the first line what  
that what our data shows that so this <unk> this <unk>  
right  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
ah there it is  
so it's a constraint  
thanks  
we didn't have enough play doh to make it three d.  
because i saw uh some phones that were banana shaped uh wireless phones not mobile ones wireless for the house  
as in the case of very <unk> plastic or titanium it should be somewhat spongy  
so maybe this is literally just a way around it  
well  
okay well  
okay one nice big button  
mm-hmm  
so if you want now we can discuss about um uh the crash and the loss of data  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah  
so um i thought um i would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data  
less buttons so it must be  
so we will just use a a standard battery  
alright  
in fact even by inviting um people from um informatics and from or maybe from philosophy and things it might bias it in a particular direction  
i'm quite lazy i don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television  
yeah yeah  
but this is kind of interesting  
no oh yeah  
yeah  
we have to practically test it  
not all five if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um  
round forms  
i think they normally do  
no it why is not uh that's that's not the question i'm asking  
and since i don't know the person i can't tell whether it's one of those or not  
you can dump 'em into one video frame if you don't mind losing resolution  
so  
current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour  
there we go oh  
yeah  
hmm  
magnitude of uh no before d. c. t. your <unk> oh  
um so the push buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push buttons  
you say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition then you say the question and the answer  
these numbers are full p. l. p. thirty nine okay  
yeah  
otherwise you go in too slowly yeah  
so skip through this  
okay  
yeah it's true but you know they're features that users want  
or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up  
mm-hmm  
yeah you can ma make rechargeable one yeah  
yep  
and you can operate them  
mm-hmm  
yep  
well  
i'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user <unk> requirements specification of the functional design  
so have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision  
glow in the dark  
okay  
um i think i might have got that wrong  
but now <unk> no but it doesn't have to  
uh second i think you will get the most revenue from i from it  
<unk> <unk> you you you push the button or something  
yeah  
maybe <unk> maybe maybe anna maybe you can start  
i think it may it may be okay but it depends how long  
high school educated  
so  
i'll yeah i'll have a look try look at the actual appearance in the next break  
i just want so you can say from the time where they picked up triangle one to the part time it became part of the assembly  
alright average is two  
home  
first of all the functional design objectives  
yes  
mm-hmm  
but but a reading of this you know  
i see  
um so it's not used very often but people still find it relevant  
yeah  
what we're going to do right now is come to some decisions definitive that we can all agree on  
yep  
yeah  
that was i was a little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do but let me i have to like write something on the <unk> so  
it's silly  
yeah  
but if we're building in a sort of error margin um it it will be based on pixels around  
yeah but young people like that  
yeah  
i think they're all non toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two year olds  
then the project plan  
or do i have to put in in the <unk>  
we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings  
uh the the slide frame grabber  
so for example it will be possible in any case because the <unk> infrastructure is ready and now we are going to collect the presentation  
no no it's <unk> <unk> if you lose it  
okay  
uh like uh i dunno like uh carrots or something  
i can't see the  
this is the agenda for today's meeting  
two features  
yeah yeah  
so basically the time from when somebody starts looking at an object until they leave it  
not yet  
oh okay  
okay  
so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets i won't mention any mention any names  
yeah  
so i think it's better to first have a presentation of my work and then we can discuss uh with this crash in temp in temp uh what we can do uh for my future to to continue my research  
they just want it to be on and ready to go  
um amusement and so on is yeah  
uh yeah it's the  
but the the spinning <unk> not there  
yeah  
it's like this  
um  
um whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable  
you have your channel changing volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle  
we want to look it like our original but familiar  
yeah  
but since we're a cutting edge company we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition whistling recognition and rocket power  
and also because there is a risk that uh we submitted a project maybe it will be rejected we don't know  
some of uh some other machine yeah  
um the one group for the for the display and one group for the basic functions and  
okay  
how  
i dunno if any of them are fancy in i'd say two because <unk> unique  
p.  
uh oh  
the one thing i'm wondering about  
as long as like the algorithms are designed um with it in mind i don't think it's a very big problem  
oh but that was in your presentation so <unk> what would you imagine it doing  
oh  
that's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television but  
no  
yeah  
yeah i think would have been  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's like fine from coarse to fine  
so it won't be a problem it will be and it will be it won't be heavy  
that's a good idea i  
has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also do you think  
teamwork  
or laughing  
'kay  
on frame  
uh  
so uh now we will try out the white board we have here  
so the magnitude you don't really use  
uh <unk> decided to put they have decide to put two additional requirements forward  
yeah the <unk> good  
yeah  
um i would think would be more like sixty percent  
and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like  
no i <unk>  
on my agenda  
it is a bit limiting isn't it  
yeah this your  
okay okay yeah  
kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed  
okay  
yeah that's that fine  
i see  
i can imagine that us  
so it's sort of iffy but that's kind of what you'd say  
mm-hmm  
which converts the data the user that's controlling the chip and the infra red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver  
that's even easier to draw than cat  
yeah some use triple a. <unk>  
you'll lose 'em in your pocket like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember  
perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high tech design  
if possible  
because you <unk> have that curve and you have that curve  
um with uh maybe a channel <unk>  
that's it  
so i dunno if i can do that like this  
no but the things behind it  
okay so very intuitive design i guess  
i <unk> separate course is good idea  
this is uh mm  
yeah  
okay  
mm  
who wants it  
yeah and then we have different languages  
then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button  
it <unk> <unk> particular sequence and then it gets activated  
uh since we do put the fashion in electronics it is kind of important how our product looks  
we come back tomorrow okay  
green  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample which you can't do with a normal remote control which people already do  
whoops  
i mean 'cause i can't imagine there'd be an essential difference really between the  
where do i call your display  
remember we only have forty minutes  
um  
uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply  
yeah but <unk> yeah  
i do like i mean there's not guarantee that anything stays there but overnight it'll stay  
you mean like just like from from a beginning to end point like within one meeting there are several topics  
mm-hmm  
uh yeah christa pavlov mm  
uh the spots they're going to uh visit and also on the uh kinds of uh <unk> uh vehicle or or transportation yeah  
so at the beginning we apply d. c. t. in order to get to frequency domain  
yeah  
at the functional design meeting um  
yeah prob  
i would put it sort of sub centrally so it's yeah  
one thing i did not say i think  
yeah sure  
so as you see uh it first have to be very nice  
yeah  
news for nerds stuff that matters  
very stupid but it is  
that's  
mm 'kay  
okay thank you  
on them  
that's gonna be <unk> problem  
no  
up down for volume um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions  
i think they are more talking about um user requirement for the meeting than soft text they want to know  
yeah  
mm  
but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the t. v.  
do we do we use punctuation in these cases and i don't know  
how do you mean  
yep  
it's that it's um hang on i wrote it down here somewhere  
yeah  
you know not to be not to be pedantic  
no  
what was that  
there is for example and this is something that eventually can be done  
back to the design room boys  
and i'm using f. d. l. p. for that still playing with uh more less one second long segments  
mm-hmm  
so uh i think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it  
okay just like that  
exactly  
so big buttons flashy design and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing  
one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small  
you still need some kinda scale for these things  
you're not transmitting at all like  
um by the way how long um how much time do we have for the presentation  
i don't think any of us remember the fifties  
no but <unk> like uh so they are they are segments in what sense  
yip  
a joystick  
'kay  
because it's a <unk> feature  
yes  
number four  
i mean it could just be yeah the number of different yeah  
yeah  
that's it's not like a standard i'm just thinking i mean what sort of opt it's not like you can't just do standard um  
yeah that's the thing but you wouldn't know it was a <unk> yeah  
excellent  
um they do not match the the operating <unk> of the users  
yeah  
so so um i will probably send um just one file of the first meeting um to all those who need it so that you can have a look whether that's what you want  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so we would add that to that file  
um and the nearest we've got to <unk> to spongy there i guess is rubber but um  
okay  
yeah  
like an ipod or something  
oh a wooden look yeah  
mm  
okay um  
yeah  
let's hope the pen holds out  
so yeah  
yes  
but then if you want to detect different languages this is another task  
uh i think you have to indicate the amount of push buttons we want to use isn't it  
what shall we do  
um and um oh well i might as well throw a british person in there um you can't go wrong with <unk>  
it's it's uh  
r. the double r.  
no uh are the plates interchangeable  
and enter would be for like you know the menus  
you'll just make a link in  
i don't know i don't know how this you have to <unk> the check the statistics  
eight euros  
right  
are we supposed to do right now  
then applying uh power in order to get um to <unk> to power domain and then i. f. f. t. right  
so i think this is the best of two worlds  
yeah  
mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be  
uh  
yep that that those names are mislead well the t. f. i. d. f. is fine but word importance is completely misleading it's not word importance at all  
it'll give you the sports  
yeah  
that's the question  
it doesn't work  
uh format yeah format  
do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough  
or sort of our work on setting this up  
alright  
i think that would be pushing it  
alright  
okay  
we have to make this like four or five or something  
mm  
or everything that you <unk>  
okay  
but um  
if we don't mark it though we definitely shouldn't mark these two should we  
but we can we can i can i can take note uh uh  
so as you see introducing more reasonable prior knowledge um will <unk> help to have better performance in <unk> in almost all the cases  
<unk> battery versus cradle i think is yeah  
um  
true  
or a strawberry seed or a leaf  
you won't get the  
f. eight again  
yeah  
'kay  
it's time stamped  
we got a bit ahead of ourselves i know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that but  
it's one  
mm-hmm  
and i think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach  
so that it smooth is  
i got some ideas uh well yeah pictures isn't really good word but um  
high velocity clouds  
yeah  
so where do you think your thing is useful  
um  
um let's see minutes from the last meeting  
here's a a fairly simple device  
well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself so it will probably be sold separately twenty five euro by itself  
yeah  
yes i made it  
well that sounds  
what do the buttons look like  
it <unk> it levels  
yeah that's right  
the the button has a special colour the frame has a special colour  
um the method i used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control  
so but we're not <unk> we're not using titanium  
prototype presentation which we've just done evaluation criteria um and finance  
but anyways we're here  
alright  
i mean the it i think syllables should be accounted for for th  
mm-hmm  
and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously  
we all have to keep in mind what has changed now  
i think it's cool  
mm-hmm  
is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore  
switchboard is all <unk>  
um we'll invest in r. and d.  
oh maybe we should bring <unk> here  
fourteen or for <unk> okay  
uh  
so i mean maybe try to see how good you can go without transmitting any of that information  
it is necessary when you want to build your uh company <unk> to a level higher  
so i guess that's what they mean by uh double curve  
black  
okay okay  
yes  
do you know if you're <unk> if you're th <unk> through the a. to z. of your music and you're looking for something at t.  
yep yep yep  
okay  
that's about all i have to do guys  
in which people will find they're uh interesting  
okay so i think this was good to see the the tool and uh tomorrow we are going to re say most of the things  
i'm just wondering actually 'cause you know i this whole fruit thing with the banana  
um i'll <unk> i'll probably ask jonathan about it  
a voice from far away  
yeah yeah  
but yeah we're not sure even sunil won't tell us  
industrial designer yeah  
okay i agree but i think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible  
hmm  
yeah  
uh well  
<unk>  
but i mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like i mean  
and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons and a simpler design  
but then the phase might be important  
so you i think guillaume said that's optic something like that  
maybe  
yep  
fancy look and feel  
but take these things into account when you start the discussion  
but that's the question is it  
yeah  
uh if it should be <unk> <unk> then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it  
but then you are losing your fruity colours  
because uh things for uh teletext i dunno uh <unk> what's the name  
i feel like madonna with one of these on  
okay  
yeah  
but the problem is again this uh bottleneck is here like you can't change your <unk> frequency modulation and  
uh no th yeah yeah yeah  
and the bottom side of the front has a little clip  
no  
they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote <unk> in the remote control  
it depends what what you mean by fancy really 'cause when i think of fancy  
mm i forgot that  
okay cool  
yeah  
yeah  
so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools  
uh with a speech display uh yeah sound everything you you noted in your uh minutes  
the volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used  
around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection  
alright  
so we said it needs to send messages to the t. v. needs to change the channel turn on and off just basic simple stuff like this  
mm-hmm  
i think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um  
for the remote control  
i want uh  
yeah <unk> round corners but <unk> but square yeah  
mm  
and then we're going to determine the technical functions what is the effect of the apparatus  
is it not the circuits that cost  
well for me  
just that it would se serve our audience  
um  
the <unk>  
yeah  
like i i definitely agree um it's a nice kind of agreement that we probably want to have  
it's not from mm  
do you have a favourite one  
now that's i just have a <unk> a <unk> question for you  
it's just  
yeah  
okay so this is is kind of uh  
or maybe <unk> will be able to choose  
the only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily  
right  
and furthermore the the the network was okay  
yeah  
so it's <unk>  
and we have a evaluation left here  
two  
if you're doing it in java could you um <unk> the output as well as writing it to a file  
yeah  
it's pop i don't think it's popular so that's the problem so  
yeah looks like uh looks like something out of a jet  
but continue  
mm-hmm  
stuff like that  
huh  
hmm  
like maybe just get the chairs <unk> or whatever  
also at geneva school they i don't think they list some kind of exchange  
what's special and unique about a scroll  
yeah it is a  
there's look events  
th <unk> the true fact considering the cost of an l. e. d. we could just incorporate it anyway  
yes but is that handy  
you know like a phone or something too small phone  
yeah um such as maybe the  
in the x. m. l. file you had but if we do that in the software  
might not be  
okay  
well we we used that one and we needed it  
yeah  
so i think um  
that's way too nokia  
and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and i uh  
and at the moment the software doesn't a allow for that  
we only need the uh the regular chip on print so there may have been a <unk> miscalculation in there  
okay  
and just had a scroll wheel interface  
hmm  
so so have have you tried i mean um i know of one previous attempt to establish what exchanges are needed for <unk> um some kinds of industry meetings  
i don't know but it's got object  
that's it  
mm-hmm  
i guess yeah white and black is better to see  
yeah  
and it's it looks fruity to me  
don't think it's an issue okay  
it's external  
i mean i i i uh did not receive any information on that but i think the competition  
and then you could have additional features in you know like a you'd have model one  
which is which i have more experiments on  
well i think we have just have to discuss if  
this aligns nicely  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
oh okay  
then it's it's it's yeah a really difficult job i don't know how it can be recovered  
the second's a conceptual design and then the detailed design  
okay  
yeah yeah okay  
i'm nathan i'm from california and i'm here doing a masters degree in social anthropology  
well this these uh these remotes are quite big so go to the next page so  
so basically th it's the same uh yeah  
i would say yeah  
it's a cat  
r. d. s. <unk> or something  
again  
ho how the the user actually uses it and and andrew of course the the product evaluation  
mm  
what if we gave it a charger  
well that's i guess where we're gonna go with this  
line blanketing you think <unk>  
uh what things do they get right what's bad about them what's wrong with 'em  
hmm  
yeah  
or because of only a few and isn't really necessary  
so if you deliver a small uh click on device that you can put on your television that <unk> to your remote control everyone can use it  
thank you i'll draw a penguin  
great  
yeah  
buttons  
yeah for instance mm  
i think that's a good idea yeah  
okay  
uh are there any more questions  
what do  
if we if we add the time we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that and is it very useful  
but we were able to do it regardless so  
i th i think we can by by not having anything too complicated  
what happened happening in a meeting  
there's a dynamo  
okay  
but i don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here  
because certain words for sure have a strong dependency on the slides  
<unk> always speaks about cars  
oh no interface  
mm  
shouldn't it fall then  
okay  
well maybe we'd  
yeah  
<unk> but it really has to fit into the budget so  
takes a little while to get excited to load  
yeah  
i always lose them  
mm-hmm  
oh okay  
yeah me too  
so it's half of the selling price if i am good in mathematics  
'kay  
you know they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics  
so um  
we'd we'd be completely using like the whole infrastructure and basically just i mean the main difference really between our project and theirs really is that we load a different part of the data  
two hours further  
let's hope uh to have some uh <unk>  
two three and five and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel  
mm  
yeah uh still it's uh it it's might be having some problem  
mm  
that's  
so so the at most more power uh  
so like a running banner underneath  
uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's <unk> uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
one where it's only here one where it's only there and one where it's both  
we'll need only few buttons  
'kay so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for  
so i think that's yeah we didn't it's either two or one i guess  
to move up move down  
i think i just missed it  
and i think it even has uh its own annotation like digits or something  
and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition if we want that  
yep  
yeah yeah  
yes it is  
you use your command and you do <unk> your gesture  
yeah  
i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets right where we could throw things into like if we want this feature  
so like i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market such as the lighting in your house or um  
uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control  
mm yes um i would  
uh our aspects from the last meeting  
you can train after that uh an s. v. m. saying this is category one or two on the label document  
well i  
what is <unk>  
the most ugly  
yeah  
yeah but give me a beamer  
that's the problem yeah  
but  
mm  
sure  
so  
yeah  
even one and two  
and that will obviously make it much easier to display  
sure sure sure  
yeah it's really uh really a good point  
with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user  
<unk> i think that that's what it's about  
or your fingers  
does it go back in does it  
exactly  
yeah yeah yeah right right right  
so i think we're ready  
yeah  
but um you but again uh  
yeah okay  
yeah but uh as norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who <unk> who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control  
it it will be fashion  
you can feel it  
well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or <unk>  
if that was like my limit maybe i would buy it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you done a good review  
so  
this is this is still um uh summary data  
yes but i can i think uh i think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition  
if you don't  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and i'll do that  
i mean they're uh <unk> so they see a pattern and then they think it's kinda cute and then they scour the world for third turn repairs you know  
alright  
mm  
uh  
that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house  
what is it  
well that's too expensive i think  
ah <unk> so input to the d. c. t. is the speech or like your yeah okay  
yeah we we scrap that one  
uh i mean i'm i'm i'm  
yeah  
the arrows by the resolution  
tell you who's more awake at this  
'kay it seems that at the moment a lot of the stuff that has to be done at sort of at the moment i'm saying oh dave  
uh  
but uh let's see introduce myself  
on the desktop  
on on the infra yeah yeah  
the the kinetic energy one is uh that <unk> uh uh they are usually modern watches since our hand keeps moving it keeps the watch ticking  
okay  
yeah you want it ordered  
something  
<unk>  
ah i can never tell which way to turn these things  
yeah  
um but you needed  
banana remote  
i know  
uh there are specially uh designed um energy friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components  
you want to go  
each sixteen millisecond  
mm-hmm  
or is that just directly controlling how fast it plays and sort of we can only  
yeah that's the thing because  
yeah buttons are the standard buttons  
are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can  
we already have a sound component by the way for the beep  
we should go for the lowest denominator  
i saved that to our um our big shared folder so you know  
and go to that one  
so maybe we should i suggest that we think about speech recognition anyway it's a it's something that can be used to <unk> a function  
what's included and what's <unk> yeah  
okay  
and uh isn't that too difficult for the we want <unk> i don't know if we still want the um r. c. to be easy to use that's the compromise  
mm-hmm  
everybody think they can can  
uh because at the detailed design how part two  
well we quite want this but imagine it rounder  
doesn't say  
it's not yellow anyway  
but it's nah it's not very clear on the <unk> maybe other colour yeah  
ion shouldn't be in there  
ah <unk> <unk> we have sometimes to use the white board  
well so the um  
i <unk>  
my name is <unk> <unk>  
small world as we were discussing before  
okay so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is  
i mean  
so what are you saying maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range  
okay  
yes i'll just get this up  
i okay i'm giving it a one the mango put me over  
so it should always whatever reduce it to half the original  
i think i have a nice idea  
um  
but we need to be different  
you know when you do the philosophy and and thingy one  
i don't mind  
do you get a good grip on the rubber  
of course  
or more words  
they should be remote  
so uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button uh as you can see oh it's here just push it in  
mm-hmm  
um but obviously a little more light than a calculator but we're not talking about a lot of light  
ah okay  
mm-hmm okay  
<unk> uh no no it's <unk> for  
right  
that should i i  
okay i'll go next  
spongy spongy  
also <unk> then we apply the d. c. t. on the trap itself which is some something like the <unk>  
right  
yeah  
like the amount of buttons 'cause people like a lot le like  
yeah  
but it's not very precise  
will this will this add to the cost  
lyman alpha forest clouds  
um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh  
it's not a source type that's definitely true  
some kind of i dunno a balance there in somewhere  
mm  
i think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest you know market share  
yeah  
so that one can be put away  
yeah right  
then you can scroll you see what number and then you push  
yeah  
or we can just you know <unk> uh take whatever we get and pick the best between us which is  
e. l.  
not only in pro providing latest technologies but also in terms of providing environmental <unk>  
and if it's just the single highest um importance measure <unk> phrase of a segment so that we have something to display for them  
yeah  
so um but still not quite sure when  
so what we <unk> what i can add is that you know he talk about what is outside  
if you're going to aim for like a very low rate code to below five hundred bits per second i guess  
ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and t. v. twenty five  
fabulous  
um and an yeah  
so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine seventy percent yeah  
um  
we have to start it right away  
don't know how exactly we will want to implement your  
it's not for uh for uh for uh philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product right  
our company already sells remote control to the older people but we we also want you know a new customer group  
okay  
please god no  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
no it's it doesn't sound simple but yes you can yes  
'cause it it you know selecting at any particular point of what the what the pitch is at the may be inaccurate  
well we <unk> something has to go to the tune of two point <unk> three euro  
yeah that's a good idea  
whatever  
yeah  
yeah  
you should <unk>  
yeah for the lawnmower project  
yeah  
uh informations on the t. v.  
i think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only britain then i think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty  
mm 'kay  
'cause then you lose percentage as an as a as a d. v.  
the histogram so we have experience with it  
well some of that will yeah but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh <unk> uh some of the new requirements  
alright  
yeah we we can uh target means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven <unk>  
but this was first step and  
no  
do our audience have the money but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button it's not a practical  
i think it's the most easier thing yeah  
okay  
i should get used to the tool so  
when i say view image on this frame  
excellent  
oh yeah  
this is their strategy  
wa can  
um  
just just two  
yeah because i don't need to generate features also yeah  
that might be a little bit uh expensive  
yeah but what what the problem is i don't know exactly  
oh and uh before i forget  
oh okay  
okay so  
it is a single curved so one of those  
yeah  
so i suggest we start the meeting uh without matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason  
okay  
i'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber  
yeah  
it what else do we want it to to do  
yeah  
hopefully we won't  
hmm  
mm 'kay  
so if you cut off all that i'd won't be use or  
or or is it obvious like when you look at these things  
well that's uh i guess it's first prototype i you see we start with uh people two people talk or and don't and don't they  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting  
i guess what you <unk>  
those for which the remote control is uh  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
so uh  
okay  
um  
so so so that that would make the trends equal so we we we really have don't have  
it's a cat  
and and then just say oh i don't know a thought and and then uh i mean that that would certainly be uh truly different  
i mean don't <unk> i don't see why you could not capture the videos i mean with a card like this  
right matthew  
print out  
and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh  
yeah  
well maybe you could have a  
organic  
and as long as i don't run into problems i don't see it taking too long  
should it be a universal one  
one for controlling the length of the summary and another one for  
hmm  
swords  
no  
yeah  
that's all i have really  
mm  
uh about all the meetings what we have decided a <unk> <unk> a report of this day  
the the thing about web pages i thought as well in that getting humans to evaluate it in some way is that you have most of the web pages that are uh well a lot of the web pages that are important in some way are are are home pages  
yeah  
yeah 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around  
once we start doing it it will all become more or less obvious i think anyway  
yeah it uh  
yeah  
right  
'cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all  
so so you sorry um just for the convention you you you marking which uh which the annotation you think is is the right one  
yeah  
uh i'll put it in shared documents again  
a charging system  
can't get in  
um and it was it <unk> it could detect it but it wasn't but but it wasn't very clear  
with the  
'kay <unk> <unk> ready  
ah <unk>  
fun and games  
still i mean yeah along those lines  
so maybe the colour is indeed uh quite but you know as a kayak is entering quite fast i mean you can have quite maybe good distance  
yeah kinda like this whole  
so are we gonna base colour is black  
is it better  
yeah  
um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you and very kind of affectionate and um  
is your husband now a stay at home dad  
so it averages out it <unk> all the distributions depending on what this alpha is  
cool  
and we can use some moving kind of thing  
so we'll show you two slightly different presentations  
i think the channel button should be in the centre  
yeah burn it to c. d. or yeah put it on on hard disk whatever  
okay  
but  
yeah  
oh i know it  
we going to try it  
do they make batteries that last that long  
bit  
not yet oh okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
ooh  
okay  
yeah  
i tend to miss out things if they're too long  
that's it speaks for itself but some uh yeah  
not bad i would say  
i guess we've got them all  
final thoughts from anyone or  
don't include <unk> of regions or systems e. g.  
so while th um  
i think it's a three  
i think hope i'm not screwing up an experiment  
yeah that's i think <unk> it's gonna be more true in some networks and in some tasks than others  
and <unk> maybe you we can do that at the white board  
yeah  
mm  
so see how it go  
i mean a power <unk> obviously  
so that is me  
hmm  
like saying oh i i have to reduce her <unk> from eighty per cent to fifty per cent  
um  
<unk>  
yeah  
but uh is it cheap enough  
okay the whole thing was  
are giant <unk> separate things  
yeah that's right  
well not necessarily  
yeah yeah  
it's uh the drawing on on the <unk> on the board is <unk> right from the pen  
yeah  
basically i was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted  
yeah  
we probably have haven't we  
and the simple buttons here so that  
if you don't have that knowledge  
so uh uh that's why i also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs  
oh i just noticed the the random <unk> like with having the hyphen before they're <unk>  
well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that  
oh was it actually possible to doubly underline things  
right it's gonna be a really funny dog 'cause i'm not sure how to draw a dog  
yeah  
the conference the the th the presentation  
well you are  
so i would've thought that we wouldn't you know rather okay  
so we'll get back to that  
would ours skip automatically forward  
if this is your <unk> at each time you get a direction  
as far as our financial uh um goals we had a specific number for profits that we wanted  
or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah  
tricky yeah  
the production costs  
i'm not even sure why i'm making loud  
yes it's um it's probably some version of the frame problem  
yeah flash lights at the side  
so you mean an a an attribute  
right  
based on the the links coming into it uh it's just a like a sum over all the the links of uh well x. link i guess  
mm  
just put it here yeah  
yeah  
inspiration  
give it one button  
<unk> i'm ryan  
so that's very true i guess for our case  
my name is hamed <unk> and uh i'm going to be interface designer in this project  
yeah  
yeah but <unk> we we want something th that works all the time every day every hour for everyone  
yes  
now i <unk> don't know what was marked here  
okay  
or don't  
yeah that's no problem  
okay  
like solar backup  
so at least seven to seven  
five  
we either we have to decide what what people want  
thanks  
and well i basically had two points  
hmm  
it's it's in the documentation  
something about  
yeah  
wow  
thank you mis  
it think we we've done good job as the cost is  
yep  
oh that's for the speech  
hmm  
uh yeah okay  
um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting  
yeah looks like it  
make me proud  
yeah alright  
yeah  
let's see one two god damn it  
so it's uh it's very straightforward  
i don't think we should do voice i think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost you know  
good  
yeah yeah  
yeah control  
yeah  
yeah you have to submit it in like two months also again  
a <unk> have two or three choices but they're different designs  
um  
why are only the first five <unk> files  
um for now on the schedule are a few points  
but if there's a chance that it's equally likely that they could have said something or they could have said something like ice cream and i scream  
too expensive yeah  
so apart from the speech we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons  
sure  
that's something we can also discuss  
so it's very important that you design a a nice looking control  
okay  
okay  
is that possible  
um the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy it activates a chip uh in the remote  
yeah yeah  
no  
it's really  
i'm uh michael  
just in perl  
yeah  
um so i think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that  
uh we can aim for i mean we can think about all these little things but we can aim for something <unk> that gives a high battery life  
yeah  
because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though i don't have much idea but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was  
thank you very much  
because uh because chi fong is gone and uh and uh barry is gone  
in material yeah rubber rubber is like i said young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood  
basically because it was not at uh at a level that could be anyway  
yeah  
you must feel the buttons for volume or whatever i think  
but we couldn't yeah  
hyper luminous galaxy  
you definitely need  
you cannot th think of that  
that's a good idea  
or  
okay great  
i would say seven  
yeah  
<unk> so that's one point okay that's with the full spectrum basically being used then  
and is possible to do this in real time  
so if if you just put just put whatever recommendations bugs on that page and i'll work through them read 'em as and when i can  
<unk> no it just points to the to the words  
but i'm afraid i take the <unk> way out and the cat's looking the other way  
i think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting  
yes it's <unk> but it is uh plastic  
um  
i forgot  
if you have a joystick on  
mm  
if each of the algorithms comes up with a <unk>  
so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with <unk> most uh televisions  
uh check with the excel sheet  
but maybe you some more results oh it's <unk> who has the results on tandem i guess no  
i'll go and see mike th today and and get the password and everything  
so the things i'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect because the technical aspect that's pretty much covered  
yeah  
yeah  
i <unk> i suppose one thing is that <unk> because it's technically innovative  
um a single function just for the television itself  
right  
okay that way it might be but the situation is that uh he he was generating his own p. l. p. features from his own scripts  
'kay  
yeah which i think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device so you have  
can we combine it or something  
yes  
looks a bit puzzled uh i dunno how to say that  
mm-hmm  
yeah because if i want something on the computer i just type it  
yeah  
so i should just look at um the speaker the speaker and an l. e. d.  
it's just extra  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so d. v. d. <unk> and v. c. r. <unk>  
okay  
every piece of uh every t. v. set is controlled infrared  
no it means curved in two dimensions  
'cause we won't know  
so we have to decide on the different remote control functions  
push what uh whether whether <unk> means that <unk> count by button or do we i don't think that makes sense  
so if uh so if i i if each machine recorded its own with a recorded the recorded like the the <unk> th the uh the user on that one  
it is yes  
yeah that's better  
but as far as i know the technology is good  
mm yeah  
now if we look at the video  
like that from its centre  
i think it should work like this  
you know <unk> was it's a single cost  
i mean working remotes we already have  
right you don't get that  
actually worked with this  
uh  
it's just it's basically it it's just a <unk> look and feel thing  
you have  
so that you know  
so we can't go  
hmm  
what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series  
so that's  
um i one thing i want to do is oh i think the meeting's done  
um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in  
well then have it in  
yeah  
yeah okay  
okay we have five minutes left  
you always have to bring out new designs so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway  
yeah i mean but why do you have a special for those  
the looks remain the same  
yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single <unk> all right  
okay uh-huh  
at least in in the meeting we have seen  
no  
whereas it would be the special colour would be for the so you would only have the one special button that was rubber  
um  
a <unk> a modern so our remote should be  
no  
is that the end of the meeting  
then the speaker might just uh uh present some idea and others will comment or uh challenge uh the idea  
are we still you say we're focusing on t. v. but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control  
and we have some l. c. d. controls  
triple r. or triple r. c.  
um did we decide on a chip  
well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away  
that are further directions  
we have yeah  
mm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
excuse me  
oh yeah  
it's really kind of a  
or you get the menu on the l. c. d. screen on the remote control  
uh yeah  
well i think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy  
yeah  
oh right  
mm-hmm  
it's okay  
i think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements and we can <unk> the product based on this <unk>  
and one would like to know sequences of they didn't look at the same thing and then they broke it  
how big is it without um  
that's uh that's much uh much cheaper  
yeah bring to i gotta bring it home  
sorry  
well well  
yeah that is a bummer  
okay but then it would also be possible to re integrate it  
uh we can make a model that has one curve two or three  
maybe the fashion conscious  
and the end is um a number of uh frequency beams which are used by each person to uh explain roughly  
so they want something <unk> really very simple and uh easy to use  
in fact that's why we've given you a picture of a dog sitting in a field instead of a meeting browser  
um components of a remote control okay  
so  
oh uh  
yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons  
mm-hmm  
of <unk> course  
these are things i think we should consider  
so david came in to me and to say uh i something we'd been talking about for a while was some stuff i'd been working on about using these topic models with uh with networks  
no it's okay  
or blue  
right  
right um what are the other options  
okay well we're beginning to run out of time now so we've got a couple of ideas we can we'll have to work fast  
yeah and that's mostly the <unk> when we uh score higher on innovative technology we would score two  
okay  
yeah  
no one  
you know  
oh  
it might even be one a bit more complex l. c. d. panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the  
yeah i suppose where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time  
so it's being modified  
no  
so that the first three letters are <unk> the same  
uh well i'm using now like twenty l. s. f. <unk> per one second per one frequency band  
even if those words at the end of the day would be quite important in any sort of search of the transcript  
and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house  
yeah  
no it's easy  
yeah  
yeah  
whatever  
and then finally these are like the sort of same examples but also some more just possibilities that we could go with  
okay  
it's  
yeah  
also good for animals  
yeah  
but this if it's  
i have a little problems with my laptop  
there should be really no problem  
um i don't remember  
um um <unk> on on a what  
well yeah  
oh yeah cool  
i have no idea  
more research required i think  
okay  
so i was running some experiments and then it was okay but it's readable only so i can't write anything so  
it's not really meaningful  
and um and like i said if you if you can't make any sense of it then just use the at symbol  
yeah  
ah you want to do voice recognition  
yeah but it has to be intuitive  
but we'll have to also avoid you know buttons responding to the slightest touch as well  
you know if we're gonna go in this direction to me we're going to the other side of the cost range  
what  
mm-hmm  
so which fruit are you thinking of  
so you can have banana and kiwi and okay  
well then you have to buy a new one it's very good for marketing  
oh thank you  
most people find them ugly  
still going for that  
you'd expect it to be like a child's <unk> toy remote control instead of a real one which i quite like that sort of image  
yeah  
so i yeah  
well we've got a <unk> we've got a few ideas there  
right so page rank you basically just <unk> uh say  
yep  
um well i i added things to it  
do you think that would be conceptually possible  
thank you all  
in the in the supplies set they're actually neatly packed into a little space  
i think it'd be very useful  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
is that the button on an ipod is it what is it is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing  
well the <unk> <unk>  
yay  
oh no actually yeah you can change it for in the summary when the summary gets called in program manager you can do it  
yeah that's what i was thinking as well  
um hopefully this meeting i'll be doing a little bit less talking than i did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually  
um they're al along this yeah  
oh like overlap between what you said  
yeah i i i also uh thought yeah  
th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get <unk> through the channel  
oh right yeah  
<unk> is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy  
mm  
right  
okay  
oh you were only given red and black  
so they develop something to <unk> these two cards together and th uh this is something which is it's more <unk> which is call uh direct show  
okay  
so as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also <unk> improve the design of the product  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
i think making it out of a nice material would be very important  
just create our own option  
yeah it's maybe too much of a big issue for here  
<unk> yeah yeah but yeah  
yeah just just a cable or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on  
we've decided that it's gonna be you know uh we're going for a basic television remote  
yeah but it's the the other one  
yeah that's true  
i was thinking uh for instance uh in th in what we have um uh because i don't know a lot about um using uh like uh d. l. l.  
closing things down okay  
still looks nice  
for two euros  
yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
both  
alright  
um okay  
i guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female  
okay  
yes indeed  
i think it'd probably quite expensive to put in  
um  
if you remember yeah but that's  
good  
a sign yeah just like okay indeed  
okay  
yeah  
colours  
i can if i get down i can put to c. d.  
by the time the signal had gone to chile and back  
up and saved  
oh no it's it's much cheaper than the t. f. t. it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits  
yeah  
yeah  
mm alright  
yep  
m. f. c. uh uh microsoft software  
on the bottom  
yeah  
what what features are we actually including  
mm-hmm  
okay  
'kay  
but uh the last ones are always the  
so this is now going to be frequency  
and should i get in touch with philosophy as well  
okay  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
that's it  
okay great <unk> so let me just start this  
mm-hmm  
it's a mouse  
so we will we have chosen one that has eight uh line up  
yeah  
more expensive chip to use and if you wanna use l. c. d. it's even more expensive  
it's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes  
so size and weight  
yeah but you don't move a a remote control too much  
thank you  
we'll see  
mm-hmm  
i hear it how much work uh does put in uh here  
okay  
yeah it's really a static value  
equivalent to solar cells which i think is probably fair considering that we have in house manufacturing of power adaptors already  
okay  
so seven fourths  
let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next  
just scroll a bit up scroll a bit down  
um do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it  
yeah you still you <unk> yeah you still get the written one and the display  
can i convert these probabilities back into frequencies  
<unk>  
either way  
yeah  
the technology and the voltage can be the same  
yep mm-hmm  
on presentation it it should be one hundred percent yeah  
um  
there we go  
no no  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
what  
like really i can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know  
like  
stand by button  
not even necessary because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone  
look for missed punctuation  
is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there  
mm-hmm  
okay but this this new remote we can afford  
mission line feature we're gonna include  
yeah  
uh uh one uh one uh day one <unk> one two days like this week i can wait and see  
because when when you say here now no i'm not going to start to working on this before january  
it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on  
but i i i it's backwards  
i'm guessing  
mm  
yeah but the question is how to merge you know the google system to the system alright  
right  
it's a cut off for whether or not it counts as a fixation  
or indeed they might be looking from one to another  
and then all th that sort of thing  
yeah i i've i remember that  
mm  
mm-hmm  
come on uh advertising usually  
um and then um this uh this um  
for sure  
and and  
'kay there's the mic  
<unk> yeah i would think buttons yeah  
mm  
but i think that will cost a lot  
no i kinda like it  
such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical  
yeah  
could we carry out some research if we <unk> really need this  
black  
ah so it's optional with the okay  
this is really yeah yeah  
i suppose it does make a good pattern  
uh uh uh  
yeah  
i mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a  
yeah  
like it builds a <unk> a document by frequency matrix  
it did didn't <unk> receive it  
just try whatever you want and like it says draw your favourite animal  
<unk> a little longer  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
mm-hmm  
oh the movies or  
yeah  
i'd say a single  
um  
i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background but i might be just going a bit  
and the difference is that our system use uh is using <unk> for decoding  
yeah  
because it's slow  
alright alright  
so it's a  
yeah that's uh what my personal preference like  
the television must do that  
uh really easy to use buttons not not uh very small buttons but not the the also the big big buttons but just normal buttons  
mm  
also i i'm using all the small frames with fifty percent overlap  
i don't know  
okay  
<unk> li li  
that was also a good thing  
well maybe that's uh only yeah well it's for us because uh  
and then you can um  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
shall i just prepare it now  
here we go  
that's it's clothes  
so and do they always have that  
it is  
mm-hmm  
so he's <unk> that or mm  
yeah that's great  
so um  
it was a less much less sensitive to uh which um <unk> procedure you choose  
yeah  
do we know how much we're making on profit  
mm-hmm  
okay  
<unk>  
it is yeah  
put it on top  
so you can see you have to up or down  
the project drawing is for the next  
no  
it's not uh i went here  
yeah  
i reckon one problem with speech recognition is um i've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing  
it makes sense  
yeah that's true  
otherwise uh if there is some frame dropping you have to rely on the number of frames you are counting more or less i suppose to to assess it  
um i dunno um talking about <unk> i mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll <unk> the voice and you can give it a command  
or not necessarily  
like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control when they're just starting out and yeah  
oh gosh i should be writing all this down  
fourth  
i think the white that one on the right is as well as less cluttered  
mm no  
they both break  
and it's still yeah  
and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money  
thanks  
okay well  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so it's good  
yeah i was thinking um yeah maybe such things are relevant  
yeah i don't think that's a source type  
device itself  
what the  
um we discussed a universal one  
yeah  
yeah  
that was easy  
and then for the more functional buttons  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
well i guess i mean for you if you know for each word if you find that out then it has to be possible  
well i'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills  
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  
yeah okay  
okay  
yeah  
that that's a default uh setting  
to to the trend but  
what what would appear on the screen  
so basically a constant like that's <unk> type of a constant and give them names like so zero t. d. i. d. f.  
one of the most intelligent uh  
and they have a score  
um 'kay so the method i was um adopting at this point  
oh okay  
so you mention for example this uh fact that sometimes uh speakers tend to read  
no  
mm  
so this is the second pass these transcriptions are receiving and that's pretty straight forward  
it's leaning backwards i think in the in the docking station  
so we can share information about so i'm gonna keep this short since we had a technical problem  
um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that  
so that takes a lot of work away from us  
okay  
yeah  
um you you'll know  
um that was your <unk> covered i just <unk> i just accidentally deleted what i was supposed to say next  
um  
costs  
i don't exactly know what that means  
even though it's talking about increasing line peak it's also talking about increasing excess blue wing  
provided okay  
people like this  
it's a two  
it's not very uh ideal  
just put a certain graphical item like a handshake or something cool  
so uh we need to remove the cache for this video or this is automatic  
and like these yeah i mean i've used the software and there's not that hard i mean  
yeah what  
yeah  
and that if you push the button the led uh gives a light and uh and you see that it's working  
okay  
okay  
uh i think if i can provide something for the words as they are  
okay  
how much does it cost this one  
um  
that's the be  
it's  
this is um what's on the edge  
remote control is easy to use  
uh  
showing me age i don't know what i <unk> ipod covers are like  
have you  
three  
yeah yeah  
so  
so they're very yeah  
no i was thinking  
mm  
and then then they can do sound analysis on that  
yeah i don't think that's right  
oh uh <unk> and also for the  
twenty five euros  
kinetic one  
yeah  
um i've gotten some information that  
let's make a different remote  
um you can use multiple ones and do some um um triangulation  
i will see  
i think you're <unk> you're right again there  
mm mm mm mm  
feels good  
<unk> yeah  
uh th yeah  
i don't think i'm gonna go through uh any more of these because i i think i've gotten through most of the types that i meant to point out  
it's really bad  
yeah we can  
okay  
so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment  
especially when when we have to look at a cost  
um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control we'd just need to get <unk> on it  
so uh that's me  
mm-hmm  
you can navigate  
yeah it might be useful for drawings  
it's not in this uh card  
mm  
well i <unk> but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non issue  
and the difference between information and opinion isn't that prominent in the way people do their reasoning  
gone  
yeah  
for uh the simplest one say we start from four dollars to produce such a device  
yeah during our design i mean there was some <unk> some heated heated discussion but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and  
mm yep yeah  
i i don't know  
yeah  
what  
<unk> nothing like that  
so that's very common  
so so there is a compromise between the the lower bands the the worse stuff you just said and and the more bands the more coefficients to transmit  
it's  
okay  
okay and we only need one of those  
but this this sounds reasonable to me  
alright thank you team you did a great job it was lovely working with you  
many people stay so  
well what if we um i at i at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top  
cable there  
why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of  
well you you <unk> okay we can vote for it  
so so it should be in  
yeah no problem  
then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit including a tool training exercise  
mm-hmm  
yeah i <unk> yeah  
right  
um we have the buttons is aren't that that much  
t. n. o. okay  
uh-huh  
some kind of linear yeah  
yeah  
okay  
and then if there's turn taking we can show waves of light going from uh me to you uh or from other people  
um the <unk> we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you sarah  
so we should basically make our own x. m. l. document in memory  
well does it  
okay do you want to have a conceptual remote control there or you just want to put the function in  
where does it go into  
yeah yeah  
i think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option  
uh and this is a user <unk> one  
yeah  
case  
but it tells you or not  
<unk> not now  
so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds so yeah  
well i did  
yeah yeah  
yeah then because then we'd thirty cents left  
yeah i think they're different aren't they  
is it easy to find  
you can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs  
yeah now i'd say if for the prototype if we just like wherever possible <unk> chunk in the stuff that we have um <unk> annotated and stuff  
which which kind of people would be more  
yeah  
you love the eyes  
slogan yeah  
'kay  
let's make it yellow then  
mm  
i'll give it a two because at the moment it's not looking that way  
what we could do what could be possible is maybe not an l. c. d. screen but with a preview but <unk> i'm not sure if it's even possible  
mm-hmm  
two  
but it's true that maybe i if you store all the distance at that the distances we could do some basic stuff  
yeah well  
you feel uh free to express what you want to say  
now uh this uh to give it a more modern look  
so um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board not my idea  
so that's  
hmm  
'kay  
and then you've got your happy little t. v. watcher there  
in the l. c. d. displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume then the program then the brightness contrast and all the stuff  
they <unk> they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups  
mm  
<unk> okay  
make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least  
yeah  
so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things  
two three four  
mm  
in middle of it  
no  
i think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that  
i've seen plastic remote controls  
mm  
no those are the <unk> those are the scenarios  
uh  
mm  
they are  
yeah definitely  
yeah  
yeah  
and then <unk>  
mm-hmm  
uh but what were the <unk> <unk>  
with the locator button  
mm  
or seven maybe yeah  
so first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of <unk> remote controls  
i don't know how to draw its face  
hello  
we're done  
'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards  
no  
uh  
like in fact there there is  
so <unk> just go through onto the <unk> i guess  
right  
these two are components that we have to use and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing  
let's go with two point five then  
for this specific set of relations that that they've defined  
that they can use it in darkness like  
<unk> with a button to retrieve it so it will beep  
yeah  
but  
you're the project manager  
yeah i mean just that you know if of course you don't want to have a <unk> other libraries that may  
yeah  
so what is it  
rid of that because gonna use a battery  
it's quite strictly imposed now  
think i'm gonna go with the four as well  
so maybe a a minimalist design the least uh possible amount uh of buttons  
i can't remember seeing how to transcribe mister  
because this is how you keep it  
it's not <unk> you have really large inventory of the speech  
<unk>  
then trends whether it is as fashion trends or not  
you think it's possible for the twelve euro fifty  
um there's a minus uh two times here because this is the most important point  
um  
thank you uh that was a very uh good session i think we uh we  
very co very <unk> <unk>  
okay  
cool  
um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide  
or maybe this is something for the next meeting i can draw out some ideas  
so you're gonna look into this right  
i enjoyed making the prototypes  
so  
okay yeah  
uh you could you could as <unk> as like a mouse you could  
you dunno  
we have three audiences of two audiences i'm sorry  
yeah  
finishing touch and then we're going further  
but we dunno what it should be or like are we going yeah it looks slick  
hmm  
but they don't come filled uh until  
it's uh yeah  
yeah  
or do you think it could appear in the summary  
could it be possible to have uh you know like a rechargeable internal battery like well like an m. p. three player does  
yeah  
yeah it it i yeah it also uh it also takes one point less  
does the remote whoops  
uh let's say would be a <unk> square box but then with curves on one dimension  
well yeah  
no no no like et <unk> you know when you have uh when you have a citation and you say et al it means and others  
industrial designer  
because um yeah <unk> i mean we have seventy five hours per yeah  
um as you can see here the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five  
yeah yeah  
but in temp he wasn't having lot of important things yeah  
uh and what about the user interface concept  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk>  
it would save enough yeah you can choose this drop these then we have a half euro left  
so and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you <unk> next step right  
we have to sort out the bug kind of thing and see how reliable is this end point detection for us  
um if that's a favourite you just like by pass two to five  
<unk>  
no  
um  
um the volume up and down  
have been met okay  
so what do we think  
they great  
that's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is  
uh may be better yeah  
uh  
yeah i guess then it's  
okay  
a what  
and throw away what is not that good and and th the first three three papers which are the best <unk> should be implemented and used from from that time onwards  
so toby you wanted to uh have keywords for each topic segment or something  
yeah  
okay and how do i press <unk> just the next button  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
um so what's our pleasure here what would be the cost consequences of each of the three  
yeah mm  
yeah  
yeah you should run it  
yes  
well but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button the number part  
okay  
so they kinda just stretch over  
and it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget  
<unk> not used anymore  
yeah  
uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose  
any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time  
yeah  
so in in your case like it would basically would probably say the utterance here or at least some part of the <unk> yeah  
um okay hold on  
something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on  
fine  
i don't think  
uh we'll do the opening and then uh  
that comes with our remote control  
that's  
is it good  
but an a. g. n. is an object  
what is  
so  
what i have  
fifteen point four  
yeah  
and then uh we can close  
so um  
you can move your point so that then this will be like one and this will be second  
okay so uh at <unk> we we have  
two  
but they are talking about star burst galaxies  
yeah you can guess what it is  
all set  
you were running that on what we what was it like half a million pages something like that  
and yep that should be in  
it's it's it's it's  
yeah  
individual actions  
mm  
um that's what we'll do  
and the volume would just be like the same way forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking  
yeah with and one without  
mm-hmm  
no no i think a minimum is <unk> twenty milliseconds is i yeah  
thanks  
all the papers  
or maybe here in the middle but we'll decide later  
yep  
because anyway this is what you are working on right  
yeah  
because it's there is no like  
the arrows over here and here the <unk> simple uh  
but we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway  
yeah  
okay  
'kay my task was this time to put up a questionnaire  
it's only for television  
okay okay  
yeah i agree on what was said uh mainly  
'kay  
i was thinking to some extent nothing would would prevent us uh from also acquiring the slide but really the slide stream from from this card indeed  
then it shouldn't ever fail because then it should never  
yeah yeah <unk>  
yeah special  
uh  
um  
i wrote it once time to copy it to my home and so i have all the data of my c. d.  
make it  
should i start  
sure  
has it been forty minutes or whatever  
the amplitude of the sound which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time  
i think she should just i think she should just write her own  
yeah  
yeah  
i think for now we we do it this way and then we we think about what we need out of it in the end  
yeah but that's going to be expensive you know  
and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design  
first it's difficult to to show that it works for all all the <unk> right because it's really and  
no  
'kay  
isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber  
<unk> pretty good  
<unk>  
uh also for the cost uh we should only put one battery on it  
twelve fifty <unk>  
mm  
so we need to write that  
yeah  
so like slamming on it  
the <unk> the other person's gaze position as well  
of our original goal  
me too a two because only the battery is not uh  
how does this happen  
<unk> what  
hmm  
uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also  
we don't really want to play them independently  
just like like that  
the corporate image  
so  
yeah  
yes mm  
and uh we if you use the l. c. d. we have to  
and then that that puts off the question of um when do we have to do this to when we get h. p. s. g. stuff right  
um oh uh <unk> uh no um th it's not got it's uh yeah it's i well <unk> actually i could probably just photo copy the manual  
uh-huh  
um so if we have the three presentations and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss  
next six  
you're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research  
mm it is a good sales ploy to say aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons  
okay  
that that'd be cool  
but that's my opinion  
oh you didn't get that  
it's very no it's very strong  
and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something  
that's what a <unk> presentation is for  
come up with new product  
no not false  
a vicious  
hmm  
so that's for your consideration as well plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up  
okay we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions  
and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work  
um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it  
that's good good  
uh no younger than forty  
yeah and of of course pet uh petr for signals  
yeah  
yeah this is good but it it's not good enough  
they liked square shapes with round edges  
mm  
okay  
still i don't know if it's quite within our price range  
i didn't quite understand  
<unk> you <unk> yeah  
so the the programming side of it doesn't sound too hard  
yeah the the yellow is more representative of the colour but the button itself the blue can be anything else  
it must be a fashion  
the words are no way are going to help your recognition anyway a. s. r.  
yeah  
yeah yeah like like the ipod idea that that we just saw  
okay  
has a c. d. burner  
you know some blend of silvers and blacks  
are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment or are we gonna <unk>  
um i've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote what they want  
yeah  
yeah but i th i think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something  
yep  
um uh <unk> i think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power  
so sounds good  
up and down  
just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of  
none of them i'm particularly keen on by the way  
but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five euros  
because i thought it would be like et <unk>  
uh this is uh just a  
or materials  
yes  
graphical user interface  
um  
and that's kind of what the um  
i mean 'cause uh <unk> so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button  
yeah  
what why does it why does construct one become construct two when you add something to it  
'kay so <unk> or flat  
so is is the advantage of <unk> that you can just like <unk> it with other  
i'll do that next time  
not to matrix <unk> my matrix  
the next element um is the product looks good  
yeah  
so but le let us see first the new requirement  
um what you do is you have don't have cables but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board  
interesting  
uh that's me  
um i like its ugliness and uh yeah whatever  
so this is a television remote control  
that's true  
i think i've seen those slides  
yeah  
it's not a button it's a led it's a  
yeah  
so what i want to say is on this card there are four inputs right  
i mean will you have a camera  
i would say yes  
just a hunch  
yeah  
uh the batteries uh we also thought about that already  
he also  
so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together  
see how far we can go with it anyway so and one thing that should be important is that the corporate <unk> colour and slogan are <unk>  
yeah  
allergic to animal fur so um fish was a natural choice  
and i think that's un unique as well  
which isn't hard  
hope it working  
yes so um actually i just <unk> i don't have power let me just switch on the other which is gonna run out  
we use all four  
anyway you go back to one frame around <unk> one sixty for instance i don't know  
are there you know bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again  
you watched it a lot  
'kay  
we can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range and for this range we don't need to ask any permission  
or  
no it's for every single word  
um now i i got your note about uh keeping the cost down  
then that's all  
but nils you've got some work left  
doesn't it  
but is it useful or not <unk>  
you then discuss it  
it beeps back at you or something  
yeah  
mm  
chris  
uh if you if if you use the basic  
manual  
mm-hmm yep  
yeah  
yeah  
up  
yeah  
and for you the product evaluation  
it's gotta be cheap  
so remove one of them  
here  
yeah 'cause i think the ascii format as it stands does contain blink information um 'cause uh <unk> <unk> i'm sure i'm sure that's appeared in the in the documentation i've read through  
so i added that in  
well it's a sample sensor sample speaker  
okay  
'kay  
no okay well that's true  
yeah  
or do you <unk> perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout  
yeah  
what  
one yeah  
i think we should yeah  
mm-hmm  
polls like what do you want a one a two  
right it's uh <unk> it's a little bit up to you  
yeah  
and we asked them to <unk> uh what the remote uh <unk> feel uh like and uh what what's uh important  
and every time we <unk> we generate a new corpus and try to carry out new research we discover sort of areas that are too controlled you know  
like there's gonna be some small <unk>  
okay  
and we will uh so at the beginning we wanted to put this l. e. d. modules uh in the tables  
you two are going to work on the <unk>  
solar cells yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah we said no to that  
i know um  
so we can can uh yeah <unk> the  
i think we're we're done  
mm  
um yeah  
yeah yeah  
<unk> um  
hmm  
uh programme uh information or or or or <unk> or a guide  
actually that makes sense because i remember like  
mm  
sounds good  
'cause nice  
no that's  
yeah  
yes so that's a seven then  
it's  
yeah i mean if i'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables maybe we could've taken that into account  
yeah i've got it there too  
but  
store up to eighty speech samples controls four devices t. v. cable satellite v. c. r. d. v. d. and audio  
but  
whatever  
uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving  
so  
well not too much  
yeah yeah  
or is are you coming on to that  
<unk>  
you're not holding it like this or something  
yeah just put philosophy of language  
we're having push buttons on the outside and then on the inside an l. c. d. with spinning wheel and we're incorporating voice recognition  
yeah  
be careful with that  
it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant even if i personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least so  
okay  
um so so i'm using that as a way to to get into ha ha using the dom things as well  
okay yeah i'll i'll agree  
mm  
anyways that is that it for now  
um do you have anything already <unk> um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product  
if it should have a technical problem that we could re replace it at no cost  
uh  
mm  
uh  
unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have <unk> for the volume  
mm-hmm  
and they have to divide it in five group and in the end it's not al it's it's always different to the clustering each people has  
okay and then visual  
so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company they'll be <unk> uh cheaper uh all these options  
um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing  
um it's a very simple one  
<unk> since it it knows who is using it  
so as you say you want something technologically innovative maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting maybe will attract  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
remarkably soft <unk> <unk>  
or do we have just uh channel plus channel minus just to just to scroll  
mm  
i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system a programme which can be seen or heard  
isn't <unk> has <unk> do you watch the new season  
well i dunno  
yeah that <unk> been pretty good  
that's a bit uh  
yes  
okay  
i mean i think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features being environmental and without the batteries and what not  
only the l. c. d.  
well i guess as soon as we have the raw text  
well if it's just multiplying to numbers  
yes  
yeah  
i need to look at some of to see  
<unk> uh okay  
um and international tastes as well so  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
okay i can go  
right corner or maybe here in the middle  
a bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone  
um eye catching really bold designs and a spongy feel  
thank you very much  
yeah last thing uh this is a kind of uh x. m. l. that is <unk>  
you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much but occasionally you will use  
yeah of course  
six okay  
okay i accept the minutes  
and the basic yeah basic functions yeah  
order of participant number here  
yeah you have to push harder  
so so okay  
mm-hmm  
the folder yeah  
yeah  
the  
and then do we get to make a remote control  
and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like  
because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have  
yeah i think so  
you so this week he's got you know the g. d. f. stuff to do  
oh you can put it here  
and uh or temporal <unk> frequencies actually  
oh okay  
i think mm  
yeah  
i know  
okay  
uh  
so  
is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then  
uh as it says we're gonna get individual instructions but uh i don't think they allowed a lot of extra time  
yeah  
no it's other way around  
yeah okay  
right yeah okay  
yes  
in uh  
oh that  
i mean the whole point <unk> of keeping well as long as you're able to yeah  
sure sure  
right  
'cause that required the advanced  
the <unk> that's the that that one  
they don't use anything which is to uh too new which is not that safe  
as uh as i said a <unk> a <unk> few moments ago it i would like myself to write with a normal pen because must um  
right okay  
and you couldn't do the teaching unless you done the induction because you had to know about health and safety and fire safety before you could take a charge of yeah  
so it's just i guess whether damped lyman alpha is a <unk> feature  
yeah  
like if we made a <unk> if we made a <unk> for every remote we made someone bought it then we have to sell a lot of remote controls  
yeah that's true  
well huh  
um so uh just about changing rules  
okay  
what's a hand <unk> dynamo  
so you have a menu button and then you can go up and down  
now another picture  
yeah that's that's it  
seems not it's either l. c. d. or push button  
it would be about  
'cause i was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium make them a rarity so to speak  
yeah  
okay so we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale and so we need to discuss how we feel  
yeah that's right that's exactly what i mean by voice commander  
so the <unk> always on yeah  
um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo  
yeah okay but we we have a <unk> yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're <unk> zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control  
you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff and you heard on the news that uh that he yeah  
uh-huh that's like the l. c. d. one is it  
so we're <unk> we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds  
yes  
we have a large history our company on push buttons  
yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and <unk> we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and <unk>  
yeah 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control  
hmm  
yes  
yep  
but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well so they need a simpler remote  
our research and development department and i went to paris and milan  
done  
yeah  
hmm  
they haven't been if it's yeah  
well that's true  
right  
so that's the sample sensor  
mm yeah  
so so you want um the dialogue act numbers to be um continuous throughout the corpus so that second meetings begins with three hundred um something  
oh and just one function  
audio we have like your basic <unk> your base your mid range your high range  
that would be cool  
mm-hmm  
oh  
and if we are gonna use spongy we can say it's long lasting you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that so  
get out of here  
yeah for the spongy uh feel  
mm  
um  
mm-hmm  
with a module  
yeah  
but enough to get the pages that were close to <unk> to have a lot of links between them  
yeah  
so um uh <unk> move on  
how do we uh uh or insert text  
uh  
like this  
yeah alright  
mm  
right  
okay um  
um you're gonna look at product evaluation  
yeah  
um  
um i can't actually remember uh i how it worked with the the moulds  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
we could use  
well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things  
um and but i'm not exactly sure how you'd use that like would the computer come  
well i i mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables  
yep mm-hmm  
individual meetings  
that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before see i'm learning all sorts of new <unk> terms in technology today  
sounds good  
yeah  
yeah but the most uh easy to use is just with one button  
there were forty percent each and this is how they became sixty percent now what okay  
yeah  
and of course you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong  
is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was  
oh no right okay  
and they <unk> they uh already worked on uh a european project called <unk> where they they have uh release  
okay  
yeah  
thanks guys  
trendy  
yeah  
did you locate it  
yeah  
uh to choose  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so luck but good  
i'm assuming that's what the m. means  
yeah  
<unk> so joel is going to talk  
my dad used to talk about he's from bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when i was a kid  
just put it on the <unk> desktop  
okay  
that's about it  
which uh i think requires you know that states the un the information they can send is this  
yeah  
so it's it sticks like refrigerator door completely  
yeah  
that's 'cause i'm sick of milan  
yeah  
this is what i'm wondering  
didn't think of that  
yeah  
wrong one  
um <unk> uh but uh the <unk> decided what was one segment and what wasn't  
yeah  
yeah mm-hmm mm-hmm  
uh  
yeah users  
hello  
okay so uh just just go for design for now  
maybe it's important to make it compatible with the d. v. d. player  
minus that one fight  
would that not be the way how they would want it to have to do as if we in the end  
um conventional battery would seem to make sense  
uh we're done we're finished i believe  
and the buttons are more well it's very thick now but  
mm  
these are very <unk>  
hello  
true  
he is used to it act  
no  
oh yeah  
little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves huh  
yep  
i have it open myself i guess  
yeah yeah yeah  
you wanna close down huh  
<unk> that why we have the solar ti yeah  
i mean es especially when you get into higher level sort of uh interpretation it's yeah  
yeah  
yeah <unk> is  
some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting  
yeah  
and this was the interface designer  
mm  
um so that was the last meeting  
yeah  
yeah  
so it's  
you just leave them out  
so yeah speaker change is  
okay  
layout  
maybe not export function  
power <unk> button should be left at the top  
what's that  
okay  
oh yeah  
hmm  
you know how far away you can be from the receiving unit the the t. v. and still have it be operational  
i it won't be when it's been  
good price  
okay it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints primary colours and sponge like material  
oh wait never mind you can't save it to the  
it just emits the signal  
but i mean  
it's a bit uh unclear because i wanted to copy paste something  
so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy  
but uh i  
yeah  
but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through  
by hand  
yeah  
don't ask me how it's done i i know the theory so yeah  
okay  
uh well <unk> personal preferences is is uh a simple remote with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use  
i think  
going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons  
okay  
evident  
<unk> okay  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um  
thank you  
so we're going to make a very fast track  
so uh you're right we can uh see in our uh r. and d. uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy  
we should probably write some user documentation 'cause i bet that will get us marks  
it's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go  
well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets  
right  
of course those <unk> <unk> who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends  
yeah  
the speaker costs far by far the most  
i've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing  
that's good  
especially i  
and uh  
okay  
yeah um oh yeah so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design  
so um but yeah  
mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble <unk> double rubber double curved case  
okay so we're at twenty five  
yeah  
okay okay okay  
yeah so uh so uh <unk> <unk> because yeah  
but then uh i think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it that uh isn't that bad idea actually  
no  
do uh by just <unk> shape and the look of it  
it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime you can yell at it and it'll just change it  
so uh  
no  
so yeah  
okay so that's probably feasible  
side view yes it's side view so uh i i'm not technically good at th three d. <unk> but  
if i can cut in is it people or men  
there's probably also social interaction factors in that there's sometimes just a meeting like if people adapt their f. zero to each other then they're sometimes <unk>  
um <unk> discovered something strange about the orientation of <unk> from when it was constructed to when it appears in the um actual task  
hmm  
yeah okay  
so we can we can say <unk>  
then that's the way we really should play it  
and i think in the <unk> it's probably gonna be it's a good one to test on  
i <unk> i don't <unk> i don't think that it would be a a structural weakness  
but can you give us an example of a scheme that's based on exchange of information  
yeah  
dark grey something like this this colour or something  
okay  
yeah  
if you make it a flat one <unk> <unk> it's no curve you got no curves  
yeah like mobile phone covering  
how <unk> <unk> how recently that nothing i haven't i heard anything from joe for a a week or so anyway  
and uh some special components uh ideas like uh blocking  
and i'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah  
sorry <unk> could you go back for a second  
it's  
yeah  
i was gonna say  
no i have to manage to get at things working on on monday  
you agree on the two  
okay yep  
uh <unk> that's a same step further  
so do you think you can celebrate your creation  
yeah  
it's a double r.  
yeah  
i don't know  
yeah but but if we ca  
but he will have it again  
a little artistic  
hmm  
sure  
i think simplicity fashion  
um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that  
having just listened to what corinne just said i'll draw on some of the things as well  
and uh and uh the numbers that should be a bit larger i think it's not really on scale and and so forth  
'kay  
yeah maybe two scroll wheel as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel  
yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna <unk> we are gonna sell uh four <unk> around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap  
early twenties that's the kind of age group  
yeah  
then it would just  
uh i'm doing my p. h. d. in <unk> i sit at the department of psychology  
you'd want blinks as a separate tier if you're gonna have it in  
ah  
so um  
in that case they wouldn't buy our product because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality  
thumb to use the <unk> joystick easily  
it's kind of it's it's ergonomic it fits in the hand uh rather well  
and you just uh have chosen some text  
and this is the uh the infrared uh port  
and then use it  
yeah  
<unk> yeah yeah  
well that's the that's the problem  
i kinda i like the potato look  
it might be <unk> stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person  
yeah  
simply because i've used one hundred as a minimum length of a speech word  
so  
so yeah function design  
nist evaluations  
i think i it would could be could get lost  
okay  
you know that's that's one kind of <unk> way of looking at data  
yeah  
yes the voice technology indeed  
uh  
yeah  
we have the alarm system  
oh yeah i can yeah i can do that  
alright  
and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the l. c. d. screen  
it should be available but not  
the new product  
okay  
hear from the user interface designer now i think might be an idea  
i guess not  
so next line  
right  
mm  
yeah  
okay so double curved single curved what do we feel  
yes i think it can generate uh things  
<unk> for now  
and of course yeah you have the the the plastic front end  
no no no  
uh i find some uh some interesting quotes on the web  
yeah well menu yeah maybe  
uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around  
um i don't know which one of these i have to bring with me  
but if you're uh a regular t. v. user and you just want uh to watch the the dutch television networks  
but it pretty much looks like a banana already  
is it in it it's an <unk> group instrument not a research group  
yeah i suppose i sup  
yeah  
yeah like the older <unk> older colours i can maybe  
yeah  
yeah  
do you agree with that  
well you could argue you might do it once a year you would change because at the moment you're making a red apple  
any other immediate thoughts before we  
let's go crazy  
expert  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
are talk about swat <unk> swapping now  
um the ipod we really liked the look of that  
it's just like ten times less maybe or five to ten times less  
okay  
there's one important point  
we have your uh oh never mind  
no it just small cobra yeah  
'cause i've got square brackets around all the things that need to be changed  
you <unk> can can you can see the the shape of the buttons <unk> is a mushroom so  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes  
yeah  
like it or something like a flip telephone something like that maybe  
yeah  
because when i got the when i got the input for the financial results initially of course i wanted to contact you  
mm-hmm  
we uh meeting is uh  
yeah  
right  
it's here  
um  
good  
like it comes up to like red two or three times and stuff like that  
yeah i mean the two yeah yeah  
no  
as in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that  
yeah  
yeah  
i've prepared a little presentation  
and you don't have  
yep  
so i think for our remote control there is some inconsistency already in <unk> existing in between remote controls  
yeah  
yeah  
then i believe each of you have a presentation  
why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together  
i i don't see the logic in elimination of teletext i just i i but i'm not a tech mind either  
well if it if it was a l. l. c. d. on th on the remote i don't know that you could <unk> that you'd be able to see a  
go back  
yeah  
um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the  
so rather than saying the eye was at this particular place  
finally my beer  
yeah  
okay i might be wrong though  
you know a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself  
like if we like the one all the way on the left uh you ca you can see it on your computer better  
well there's some other ones i will address that yeah  
'cause like we do we have re restrictions on software  
<unk> <unk> what's our criteria  
but if um if everybody has a lot to do and you know  
so as we discussed we have to switch on switch off whenever we want  
that's the basic idea yeah  
one is horizontal one is vertical so it depends  
okay so <unk> so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures different forms  
okay  
yeah  
throw a general suggestion at them  
right  
oh then i need something different later anyway  
over there  
they are and it's a big joke  
or actually look at the pitch no  
okay  
six  
yeah think that's a good idea  
uh-huh  
to buy a a <unk> a cooler remote control  
yeah board a school board yeah  
<unk> ah nobody wants to talk to you  
which appeals more to the product that we want and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user <unk>  
the turn  
yeah  
um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device  
so it's you know it's fine  
mm-hmm  
i don't know what this is but it's really really annoying  
and then yeah  
yeah  
yeah that's probably quite sensible  
mm  
mm  
the cities uh for example in some place in in <unk> senegal so if you have electric if you have solar <unk>  
we said that uh  
so yeah so um i'll get that from you and i'll write the hash table which goes over that and creates a dictionary file  
well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find i think  
what would it be at the beginning  
yeah  
yeah okay  
the opening  
uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make  
yeah  
there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there  
oh yeah  
that seems very good  
is the project evaluated  
yeah  
yeah  
alright  
when you make it titanium it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need  
'kay thanks guys  
mm-hmm  
sorry  
in okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want  
main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look you know  
<unk>  
yeah  
an  
it's essentially for all the window handling it's the same event  
the characteristics i talk about we have reliability we have comfort we have ergonomics we have environmentally <unk> sensitive  
i'm gonna make one for guitar <unk>  
maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this  
uh so the user interface will consist of two parts  
so i mean like you could actually  
um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to  
<unk> which is gonna be horrible but um this is more or less in the end  
and if you put it away i think it's uh <unk> we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market  
but here you are trying to compute uh doing a to do linear prediction  
yeah  
yeah  
it looks more like nuclear bomb  
okay i'm just thinking whether or not there an are any other sources i mean maybe <unk> data  
huh  
it should be we shouldn't need to es open a a <unk> book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control  
yea  
of course try to be kind to other people  
yep  
this probably actually costs more than three if you  
um  
i think yeah  
okay  
but then you don't want to make the l. c. d. display too complicated at the same time  
have we  
the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design  
yeah  
um this product is for all sorts of customers  
um  
so take you past the minutes of last meeting again  
mm  
it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated  
maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two  
okay well finance uh will be later  
just make this thing uh yeah the the the rolls royce of of remote controls  
you don't have mine  
so i define baseline and what it loads  
yeah  
fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like fancy versus functional  
we don't know  
yeah  
where are we going  
why two  
oh okay but 'kay look  
yeah that's the only thing yeah  
mm yeah i have it at home  
you know kind of the  
spongy is the current texture but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
brilliant  
either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart  
and then when we have okay  
that's  
okay  
electrical their industrial design is very good  
that's a nice way to put it  
you get th  
okay  
okay  
yeah consider the consequences of using your remote  
mm okay  
'cause it's not gonna make any difference  
so uh i hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh  
and yeah if you want to uh uh <unk> put on stand by or change the channel that should always be possible to do  
whole day's rating  
the  
yeah  
well you could  
so um yeah we have to  
for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well  
um well i think we need to <unk> i think the ergonomics is quite um important um  
mm  
yep  
so that's one possibility but i don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen  
that price bracket so i guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know  
too much  
no  
yeah  
we'll have to think about it  
do you think it won't be it won't <unk> increase the price  
it's fine  
alright well that's for for every word and that's once for the document and that's you've got a parameter coming at this globally  
and this is what i was just saying before  
but the the name of the video file is video name is uh it's the same as a directory  
because all the t. v. uh the the remote control have all numbers lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end  
okay  
<unk> double curved  
what type of casing  
um  
okay  
mm yeah  
that means we can uh well <unk> yeah discuss on the remote control functions  
the dialogue act which we're currently uh working on or uh and uh for meetings  
so if it were flat on the bottom and then had the  
yeah  
but but that's hard to code  
mm-hmm  
okay yep mm-hmm  
uh yeah yeah  
with lot of <unk>  
got it  
um  
yeah  
so if i'm drawing and you think okay i'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there you have to correct  
and i would say take a yellow cover and black buttons  
<unk>  
but if i would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle so uh so clap option  
okay  
okay  
what do you reckon  
wait come back  
so the this is the signal which you also have to somehow encode or transmit from a code of the decoder in order to re synthesize it right  
um  
yeah but it would yeah  
ooh  
and then we we research uh fashion trends in europe what's what's the new black you know as it goes  
that um the we <unk> we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form but that uh yeah  
i think the <unk> yeah the beep is a very simple thing to <unk> implement  
over i think over  
what does it want  
and uh  
or are we going to put it in and uh just uh  
the <unk>  
because it's the same it's uh just a case of the mold right  
well the criteria are based on the user requirements uh the trends from the marketing research and the marketing strategy of the company itself  
contrast brightness yeah and anything else  
good luck  
are actually quite straight  
and this is this is also supported by the market research  
yeah  
yeah we can make it possible to do that yeah  
and elderly from forty eight to their death  
well um the first findings are that people um  
mm yeah  
but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle it will beep and you tell you where it is  
would some  
and infra infrared <unk> led is uh just a simple bulb  
you're not satisfied okay  
but if you can imagine that they say a. b. c. and d. then that would be really good  
great  
uh that's needed right now  
um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money  
yeah  
they stay and publish another papers and they but they they don't turn into a life no  
so right yeah  
a seven a three no  
yeah yeah  
so  
it's you know it's very spread out and kind of you know i get the idea it'd be sort of about this size  
so the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional you know  
mm  
mm  
that's on top of the sixteen or is it part of that  
this is it's the up and down buttons are used for <unk> up and down for a list of choices  
mm  
yeah yeah we could do that too  
yeah  
can we afford to include one of those  
for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition but younger people did  
uh-huh and then actual numbers for channels as well yeah  
yeah  
do we will we use only two buttons or or like numbered buttons  
well uh  
well if you see what i have to come up with some designs fast anyway  
because  
you mean charging it by shaking the banana  
right  
and supposedly decided on things  
okay so we'll have a hundred percent profit then  
yep  
here we go  
okay  
really  
it's a bit  
yeah okay  
yeah  
right  
yeah  
so  
mm-hmm  
well i'm i'm not so sure i think it <unk> should be  
it just explains how the process goes through from a from the basic technology point of view  
yeah  
i think  
yeah  
yep  
but  
we have to dump our titanium and we'll hate the managers for that but now we're going to evaluate our project of uh project project  
mm  
okay  
uh it's not defined yet okay  
and that you can change the volume is feature and that you can change the options of the remote uh uh something like that  
it's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun  
and the second thing <unk> second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control  
okay  
line  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah that's true  
yeah  
is <unk> some menu uh function you choose parental control and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on  
because we always lose our remote control  
mm yeah  
message and then it picks up that message um and replies to you  
but you can kind of come back to that also  
thirty  
yeah i agree  
mm  
oh i see so so it's it's like this  
th the the minutes of the last meeting uh i think we'll take those as read um  
mm-hmm  
whereas a broad line quasar someone has looked at it and they've seen a broad line  
because i'm i think i will also um i could also make use of it um for the agreement and disagreement thing  
if you look at a quasar and you see a bunch uh if you got a bunch of clouds of gas in the way  
go ahead  
so does it confuse uh the user  
but uh it's <unk> well it's it's <unk> it is the main point of the the the the look  
so  
okay  
mm-hmm  
well uh that was what i had to say  
um to save you getting off your backside  
it's not  
and in conversation the analysis so <unk> pairs are used to describe this kind of structure  
anything they think that's not been covered before i quickly write up a final report  
right okay  
uh-huh  
so that's my favourite animal  
maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves  
well  
i'm heather i'm your project manager  
okay  
yeah i don't know yet  
and you can use  
yeah we'll <unk> we'll say it's a cost saving <unk>  
of course  
it's uh  
mm-hmm  
thanks for that ron  
i wasn't completely sure myself but i think it's just like um it's it's a wheel it's like not separate buttons  
triple r. c.  
well the functions are are not more to discuss i think  
yeah  
maybe there's something on the website which will help us out  
is it one word or is it two words  
i don't know  
mm-hmm  
yeah but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project  
so <unk> completely changed our demographic there it's not part of the the funky young thing  
yeah it's not very tangible  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
the the <unk> the nuts are are red or and all the um flat things are wood colour something  
yeah it's the fruits and vegetables is the only  
okay  
and then also searched for which are the top rated uh remote controls on <unk> dot com  
yeah  
yep  
mm-hmm  
mm  
and not like some vague serial number that no one understands like with cars  
so it's easier to get it like this  
those can does that not mean a a broad band detection  
good leadership i think we stayed on task  
yes but <unk> is very uh very effective for uh matrices and uh  
so let's go for the three presentations right now  
oh they <unk> they do exist  
yeah sure  
mm  
feature extraction  
however well we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro right  
at least we have couple of months <unk> to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally  
well three  
so more like  
yeah  
yeah  
it's definitely channel volume power  
i liked the invited speaker um about the implant in the ear  
how's it going  
i don't at all know how to go about this  
what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than  
oh great  
well um because actually we can i mean uh you know if we make comments they feed back in a lo into the development  
they shouldn't be in there  
so the topics don't contain any redundant thing of like showing the whole topic again  
child labour man we love it  
yeah but but not for the remote but for the t. v. that you use  
now maybe the most critical one  
mm  
we don't know  
so but i mean you also have to you have to also have fit <unk> all the buttons and you know  
so we need to combine those ones um and i've just got an <unk> mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in  
like an area that's put a lot of effort into they're very boring very plain  
yeah i'm think about it too  
okay  
no no  
it just should change the t. v. <unk> state  
<unk>  
i think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication  
so all the i mean the important keys are right at your <unk> <unk> you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them  
you know it's on this object  
no  
five  
oh it was sort of banana shaped  
we're done  
yeah  
uh so it's not quite as progressive in complexity as uh  
exactly and in some sense intuitively it seems that it can happen  
we'll see  
yeah  
right corner yes  
uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look and feel  
hmm  
um so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting  
mm  
you have limitation both on the technical on the <unk> on the design side  
right  
so  
yeah what i'm gonna i'm gonna put um i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so i'll put all that into the final report as well  
okay  
okay that's okay  
should volume be important in the joystick do you think  
um and i'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly  
so  
next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes  
like operating a v. c. r. but they don't seem to be able to deal with d. v. d. players  
yes  
so whereas we are what we are now is let's say something like one point two kilo bits per second for uh that hilbert envelope  
and that's the same  
because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level i think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate  
okay i'll will give it an uh an eye  
um  
uh-huh  
let's start the design  
yeah  
so <unk> i lost my lapel lapel mic  
what do you mean by profile  
but it's uh <unk> more or less very simple  
for the l. c. d.  
well th this is this is the whole point yes you know  
um you programme it  
it well it's it's to make a proposal basically for your yep uh  
so we <unk> have to treat him well  
hi  
yep exactly  
uh okay  
okay  
yeah i think we would have to have the same structure one that points to it where we tie together all our information  
mm  
number of bands and  
yeah  
that's fine  
mm  
yeah  
i think the <unk> data is too too complex and there aren't enough real decisions made you know that you could clearly identify  
um the sender well i'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard  
no  
which was that  
yes but you can you <unk>  
maybe like yeah <unk> because sunil is working in nokia he's a expert in kind of features or yeah it <unk> i think  
mm-hmm  
i have a question about that actually  
hmm  
one point nine or something  
mm-hmm  
but i think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have <unk> you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it  
okay  
okay  
yeah then it's  
do you wish to go <unk> have a first bash at uh whatever  
neither  
i think  
now it's  
where  
that was something i would be interested in  
yeah that one yeah  
okay you should press next  
yeah  
okay it's your turn to  
yeah  
and you can celebrate your leadership  
it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching  
you just gotta put the food in a a a <unk> feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh  
um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons  
okay so poster boards  
maybe it's good to put it in a document  
yes  
but yeah i wouldn't worry too much about it unless they ask you for specific input  
because everything you're doing can in one way or the other be ti tied down to actual time  
yeah  
mm-hmm it's about that  
four  
alright  
yeah  
you  
no  
well the twenty five to thirty five year old and thirty five and the thirty five to forty five  
okay  
well not all not all  
and so after that he will have that band width  
what else do i have  
um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber i it's spongy all the way  
it is the essence of bananas  
yesterday yeah  
yeah yeah  
now at the moment the application is  
you also do the other sides  
well <unk> we want to have a new re remote control for for t. v. distribution i guess  
well i if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine  
yeah  
but fashions do don't last very long  
you want to go  
yeah i think so  
okay  
the met methodology to find out the trend was <unk> uh was done in a way we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey  
yeah  
uh by <unk> pressing the menu button again  
so that's that that that should be done this week  
yeah it is fruit or vegetable depends on your mood  
let's continue  
you have the same problem like for example with yep is much higher ranked because it occurs less often um in the training thing  
yeah  
because you know we had there are mm we had the long discussion and finally we decided for for one approach  
hmm  
well  
we have to well <unk> yeah and <unk> and teletext is becoming outdated  
um yeah  
grizzly bear  
yeah  
yes i do  
and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that  
but that's for later on  
i don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything  
thank thank you  
alt delete  
'cause you know we like people to know to ground the oh i thought the the lending for the booking system caroline  
uh it's just a sample sensor sample output  
uh so you have you have some problems then yeah  
yes but it's not good enough so it's a two  
uh it's <unk> on off yeah  
mm-hmm  
um  
too big  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
we in a sense we i think we are running queries it's not just about um what we load and what we don't load  
uh but when you lost it you're just not  
uh-huh  
maybe if i do the water but how  
suppose yellow is a special colour  
yeah  
the sixteenth yes  
yeah  
and they fly you to germany and put you on a four way teleconference with three people in chile  
and we include those  
right  
i i my only comment is i think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining  
uh  
it's not it's not ignored in the household  
so you've the an i. d. for a part you got an i. d. for a location on the screen  
oh right  
oh okay  
um i suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer  
right  
oh i don't but i don't think we're we're the ones  
might be funny to see what is <unk> the whole corpus as anyway  
yeah and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well  
um the kinetic energy thing um might work um but the same problem  
and no doubt we'll get um  
no listen listen  
i didn't get information on  
the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using <unk> clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so i mean i think it's clear that something at this level needs to be there  
yes  
we know about the new project requirements  
i'll let you know  
yeah i can't remember it off hand but i know there is one  
so so the <unk> the user <unk> the the <unk> user interface should be very very cute very very <unk> um  
hmm  
to have the <unk> yes and speech recognition  
i  
yeah of course small  
yeah you can watch a t. v. in the dark then  
yeah  
i think i mean i in uh from uh from an application point of view it might be interesting to make sure that your vocabulary contains all the words on the slides  
mm  
the oh  
yeah it's a bit  
can you put that in the project documents file  
okay uh  
yeah  
can <unk>  
or are there any <unk> other controls  
wow  
so just like <unk> there's bound to be like a media wave object or something like that  
thanks  
i don't know whether that's a  
because i mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra red so people don't expect anything other than infra red  
uh <unk> th th th the two numbers  
yeah  
on the top  
is the project evaluated  
but that will be very costly i think  
'kay  
i don't think it would really work  
for what  
so um i <unk> i think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to <unk> to sum up um  
electronic device  
yeah well we already <unk> discussed that huh the the l. c. d. and  
yeah  
uh-huh oh where'd it all go  
also there are papers about it that <unk> if you have like twelve frequency bands it's somehow optimal  
well in our covers in our fronts  
right the rem  
so basically this display would have information about a segment where something starts  
dave this rate thing do we have any direct control to that  
so of course i have to listen it and and <unk> well so now what i'm using are fifteen bands  
yeah  
um extra functions will probably need an additional chip  
we haven't really seen that yet  
is the project evaluated  
i don't know <unk>  
well  
uh the i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel  
mm-hmm  
material we want to stick to titanium  
yeah  
right  
yeah  
so it's better to have some prefix before the number  
and it's it's it's a quiet place  
yeah that's um  
so you could do it on 'cause i it's just a matter of i the hard part is deciding how close together these have to be before you decide that this is a event that you wanna pull out  
then after that you look and say um ha has a lot of ion in it  
so they don't count  
um oh we've got five minutes left  
yeah  
like for okay  
um  
that's true  
um for many reasons  
are there assignments  
what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand  
yes  
yeah  
okay  
i don't i don't i don't understand what  
i think go to video is  
tell you about uh what we're interested in on the so we start so guillaume started by uh developing the application that get the audio input  
uh okay think that's about it  
what do what do you think about what <unk>  
so these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people  
and um they are more critical on their money spending  
i like this one more  
i'd say lose the curve and the colour and  
so um <unk>  
uh not very much like yeah  
okay  
there we are  
um the what about the glow in the dark thing the strip around it  
it's not changing no  
yeah  
and we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting  
mm-hmm  
and on the l. c. d. how much it costs  
yeah  
'kay  
yeah maybe  
we'll still have to investigate the financial implications  
and if anybody has anything they would like to add  
okay  
you pay for options such as uh <unk> or cropping but in fact maybe we don't need that and uh it's called <unk> producer  
but sometimes i have um split one of the segments into two segments but it's easy to match the start and end times to map it to their segments  
um  
uh make it a banana  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
ah yes  
um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device  
if you also up on a computer in a strange position  
and the slogan like the actual written slogan or just to embody the idea of the slogan  
so we'll stick with sort of <unk> um for the buttons that we do have  
so that should also be taken into consideration  
all right  
dunno  
industrial designer  
well yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page up then but  
but uh  
uh this one i think  
well the thing is i think i think the type of <unk>  
i mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing i mean that's what sets us apart right  
mm-hmm  
no  
this is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves infra red or radio waves  
yeah then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah  
oh alright  
uh  
right laptops are extremely handy wireless  
um  
yeah it's <unk> looks very friendly  
that's okay  
uh i can agree with taking that out  
then  
okay  
we can forget <unk> yeah  
um  
maybe maybe it <unk> it can say that  
well we got an update for the for the audience  
okay  
but  
okay  
uh-huh okay so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want <unk> more colours on l. c. d. yeah  
i don't think it would make that much difference  
it's kinda fun  
should it be more like um like a status of  
no only the face  
i didn't get a message  
here we have the first one with the beautiful uh l. c. d. um display  
okay  
or do we have anything more on this  
a dip in absorption or a  
well now i'm  
yeah  
so you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points  
mm yeah  
yeah  
is it design for a coffee machine  
well it's it well i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll wheel  
um it's <unk> it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber  
yeah well i guess we really it we bounced off of each other which was cool  
but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just  
okay  
yeah you should have put yes  
mm-hmm  
for example  
so action in the technical meeting sense or just action in the physical sense  
yeah  
maybe um  
then i need to say some <unk> a few things about finance 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria  
yeah  
as far as they published i <unk> i know the results they published uh so far  
because i've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid  
<unk> what  
i like it  
the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology where you can program questions into such devices  
um well as long as the two correspond then it's fine  
yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone yeah  
that should be pretty nice colour  
isn't hard to lose yeah  
but anyway this is not a mushroom anyway so it's fine  
another questionnaire  
should we switch to a hand dynamo  
i think i'm coming back  
i'm not working  
uh  
um then i don't see any reason to prolong it and <unk> we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things  
oh that's a shame  
uh  
well seven to seven inches  
i mean small things you kind of expect to jiggle around right  
where you think some of them are like a bit like dialogue and some are a bit like monologue  
for what purpose  
were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings  
alright  
so i will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
alright  
mm-hmm  
we have two scroll and we have three push buttons  
well should it be larger buttons in general you know like uh the examples that i had they were <unk> quite small  
great  
yeah but but then you can uh save it in instantly and and and re use it and uh  
mm-hmm  
if we uh make a remote control with changeable covers then we can also make uh a cover for every language area  
print actually print it on the uh  
be cool  
i feel like like hanging mid air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working properly and so it's all so fuzzy the whole  
not really  
well yeah these i think  
i don't know  
okay  
but uh  
team leader  
if you have a list of of programs on your l. c. d. screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel  
oh no five  
right  
yeah  
but  
yes just lemon  
okay  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
if we had a yellow  
mm-hmm  
or some  
well someone must have made that up for the first time  
yeah  
so that people like my mother can use it  
fine  
so the key layout and design are really crucial  
i've never seen one before  
mm-hmm  
no  
mm-hmm  
it  
mm-hmm  
nah i don't think so really because you have a i know some remote controls that don't have these buttons  
you have to put it on the  
mm-hmm  
grey is better than black doesn't look so <unk>  
but but can we manage it <unk> uh for the costs  
that's that's especially because of the internet of course  
um  
and the feel and th that it is strong and  
<unk> share folder for th your presentation  
so if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed  
yeah  
yeah  
but then they are <unk> still using like error signal which is going to be approximated by code book right  
yeah yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
i don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay  
yep  
a all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape basically  
i wasn't sure uh if it was down to the number of hours or whether thirty first of october <unk> uh certainly uh uh he right  
'cause it's a bit tricky isn't it  
kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition  
it could tie in with the fanciful design as uh you know throw the banana you know just gotta keep it moving  
did you guys meet her  
oh sorry  
no because you see now all the t. v. <unk> are available on the webs  
so  
yeah  
yeah but  
and those who don't  
uh  
switch on  
it's not that uh it's not the most important function it's just an extra thing  
oh okay  
uh yes  
maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel  
so and the uh about the board digital pen  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device  
a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches  
alright  
so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it  
they can add two colours  
yeah  
but it would be expensive no  
so that was  
yeah i wanna watch this i wanna watch that  
yeah  
yep  
oh yeah everybody  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
i mean it doesn't matter if you're <unk> use mel scale or bar scale  
we need to decide who our target group is  
mm mm  
oh so that's not a physical action right  
yeah it's uh  
yeah sometimes they're contained in one another  
but i'm definitely not keen on to to no no no i'm no i'm <unk> definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies  
because of the response or  
that's cool  
well here we see the same  
yeah because yeah  
yeah <unk> <unk>  
whoops  
and i hope i can also reach a lot with this project  
okay  
mm  
cool  
it's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that so it's very like soft not so stressful on your hands  
yeah  
i'll give five  
an important consideration  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
um the other one is quite easy tho though  
um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in  
right interface concept  
yeah i know  
i think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the <unk> but i think i was the only one who struggled with that  
let's finish this meeting instead  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
so it is also why we have to have a button that says uh i'm now busy with a d. v. d. uh if we had done that  
the so every separate  
and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well where is it  
there we go  
um  
it's not just speech and silence  
okay  
yeah perfect  
but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this  
you assume that that they read correctly and i think they're the most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world  
yeah  
blah i like it  
oh it's a <unk> yeah  
mm  
so these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and <unk> specifically wanted to  
about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control  
okay okay there is li local cache  
screens on  
as in we're putting weak and strong absorption would count so i think blue shifted should  
word document the yeah we have to count them  
yeah  
i just have one question because for the intelligent controller you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition  
uh  
this thing uh that looks like a pie are actually all microphones  
right  
everywhere around the room especially here for your face of course and this isn't a pie  
gives the chips uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button  
this is my suggested design  
or uh it could be like this the p. c. b. would be the same for all but only the exterior uh shape is different <unk> for all  
should be here  
just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a <unk> box with a rubber  
uh participant three  
oh okay  
uh the i don't know if you know the m. p. three player of nike  
yeah  
oh okay  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
you you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the  
okay  
mm  
well i don't mind we can further define that  
we evaluated ourselves we thought we were great  
and by the way mister david jordan please record your presentations in your own folder  
you didn't use an x. m. l. parser  
that isn't  
hmm  
and that is actually stored in another x. m. l. document  
i've put a <unk> uh a file in the project management folder which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take  
okay  
mm  
so what is it what are the innovations with this  
yeah  
yeah that would mean understanding the nite x. m. l. x. m. l. sort of format in a lot more detail  
the c. t. is the c. t. i. o. four metre uh the name of that telescope  
remember the management said that it it had to be prominent  
um i was just wondering about the what what genevieve said before about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing  
burritos  
okay  
is that  
you know the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified  
very basic colours like janus explained  
hmm  
uh yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
ah  
like a little lightning in it  
oh we don't have any buttons so yeah we need to uh  
all to your computer  
nothing more than this just a remote control  
yeah  
okay back this up to the screen  
yeah i can play it back  
no just this closing one  
okay  
but i can't remember what we've done before  
well so i mean right  
oh i uh well with a speaker i. d.  
only for the television  
is it people okay  
excuse me camera i need to find the bin  
i think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels just because this is one kind of thing they do zapping  
yeah other i saw saw saw saw something about map task like little further down my task list  
yeah  
yeah hand dynamo  
that's pretty shocking uh  
if you can mix it it's okay  
oh so so the the this is  
okay  
um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like  
to have the light always on  
we'll see  
yeah  
then we we could use it  
and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it  
if i were buying one i'd go for purple  
yeah so  
yeah  
t. v. is becoming central in most homes  
okay  
because we could produce you know how <unk> have those overlays that you can change the colour  
so it's a speech synthesis kind of thing something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out  
that's me  
not too shabby  
i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models  
i say this one as well  
'cause i think everything in the display code is just from the first until the last one displayed  
um no but i think that's something for uh <unk> here  
a little bit <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
and then  
well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard  
i would say  
then i think it's very irritating if the next page shows up but  
so i've to avoid uh filtering and smoothing  
so it's a one  
the posters have always been in the coffee break which is why probably because normally they're limited on space and they  
yeah  
mass sales anyway we're gonna make i mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things  
i would curve the whole  
well i don't in the programme it's just they're not in the raw text files  
click to save in where do i have to save it  
would be yeah  
mm  
um then we uh lose  
how i know a marketing name for our product  
so um  
this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls  
when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and <unk> when we to <unk> for this one we have to make it more cheap  
i have no drawing skills whatsoever  
okay right it's printing it out as well  
um  
yeah yeah  
let's start at the beginning  
yeah  
okay  
from this shot to this shot we apply like uh specific um colour enhancement algorithm or restoration algorithm or uh to improve uh the brightness and something like this right  
yeah  
if it sounds like um the laughter is just um interrupting a an utterance that continues after the laughter i wouldn't worry about <unk>  
so  
you see it next  
um  
yeah  
how we're <unk> well maybe uh <unk> a ring of no no you have to maybe on the side of it  
it would have been even more fancy but we decided not to because if we use a double curved case we could not use solar  
so in the end 'cause you don't have different versions of well i guess you probably would have  
clay  
but no screens on remote controls  
i don't know  
environment friendly  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> we are living in a wonderful world  
okay  
yeah  
mm maybe useful for children they <unk> you you they only see the buttons outside  
two or three  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so the only time problem is the <unk> voice recognition  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
it's true  
let me  
or you know you lose it it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm  
what are the various components of it and um finally i'm not too sure what was the last part  
yeah  
the <unk> triple r.  
so the last point we decided it's infra red i guess  
it's different  
okay i'll just email you this file my presentation  
what did you think about uh the process  
because i really think that having like some but that would probably even be shorter than five lines  
f. five  
oh i think <unk> with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that  
duration of each fixation in the region  
mm  
<unk> i i'm curious about what the de briefing is gonna be like  
uh yeah <unk> i i think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it  
you can oh yeah  
right right  
that's  
mm  
mm other remarks or something or  
it it's not uh the project is a no go if we go over twelve and a half so  
otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well  
yeah  
uh the remote control should only be used for the television otherwise the project becomes more complex  
uh fifteen minutes  
so what we are doing now yeah you mean  
yeah i know  
alright  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
oh yeah sorry you're right  
alright  
about the  
ouch  
the <unk>  
right  
at the top  
again i'm not speaking about the <unk> i mean as  
strawberry sensors  
but if you lose the  
okay  
that's my uh  
yeah uh so let's perhaps uh in the meantime talk about the um um numbers we assign to the dialogue acts because um yeah  
yeah  
yeah of <unk> of course  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um  
yeah  
this is the most simple yeah it is possible but i've never seen one before  
i don't know what's going on with this again  
when i saw the m. with m. player it's a dissolve yeah  
or something <unk> you know  
so  
three  
uh but i know that the buttons are like a nokia telephone on uh one sleeve so you don't have to change your whole cover  
right i am going to tell you something about the components design  
okay  
yeah  
yes  
switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um  
yeah okay  
and and so yeah i'm a i'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh <unk> what is it that i'm gonna market  
so yves asked for the diva  
twelve twelve a half  
a human ah  
in about five minutes  
and no internet  
sort of remote finder then that kinda stuffs that one out then  
fancy the old people will  
global okay  
well yeah  
for example you can get um  
yeah  
now we have to do the average  
moving  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd um  
yeah  
okay okay  
i can easily <unk> easily do that  
i don't but i i know a lot of people do right  
but in th in the dark uh  
yep  
mm  
so we don't have to make it very small like uh like a mobile phone or something  
no do totally  
uh working components  
to eat  
start of the first meeting  
actually yeah <unk>  
well uh anything you actually need fixed  
so  
it's very <unk> in its design  
uh  
do you think  
um  
the fact that it's made out of this rubber we can throw it about  
uh yes i had something similar  
first it's only going to be a t. v. remote  
he basically got a job  
thank you  
so  
yeah  
yes so that they'll include the  
okay  
mm-hmm  
fancy  
potentially is quite a big response  
okay uh we are not out of time you know  
yeah sure  
me too  
yes  
it should be  
regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip for example  
and it's kind of along the <unk> lines of environmentally sensitive and it may even fit into ergonomics  
yeah  
were the most important criteria  
well there again <unk> uh think about robustness and speech uh recognition and it really doesn't matter  
interesting  
and in the the menu structure uh there must not to be uh  
yeah so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls  
that'd probably be really simple they're cheap  
yes synergistic yeah  
of course this is more expensive than this  
alright  
i would  
i think so  
and yeah so cool  
mm 'kay  
<unk> that's that's just the the eye movement uh other sort of stuff yeah  
yeah yeah  
now wake up bitch  
mm  
injury  
i think th that's a <unk> yeah  
but you cannot display all on a l. c. d.  
uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before  
i'm going to leave the decision to you um because you have to make its prototype  
well the  
also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now so you can read that uh now or afterwards  
doesn't seem like it's going does it  
yeah yeah yeah  
like if it's really long sentence of ten seconds or something you may not really need so much con  
yeah and uh x. m. l. files  
excuse me  
facility although whether or not it happens or is possible i don't know but something to look into  
yeah  
yes okay  
uh apart from that it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time  
yep  
alright  
i'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button  
mm-hmm  
well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control  
uh i wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation that we're new we're aggressive  
okay um just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um i could i'd like to hear about your experiences using <unk> remote controls  
nice  
right and the  
let's just go  
well it seems to me much less important than the other things one could get out of this data  
we're down to <unk> two buttons is it  
it's pretty abstract  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> an indoors  
well the obvious thing is a banana i guess  
uh maybe messenger ami  
and uh as well as i could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing <unk> and we should have it on the remote  
and uh it would cut out the r. s. i. as well if you  
yeah  
first uh the younger people they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours  
maybe it a good feature since it takes if it's around the t. f. t. then it's good because it's just keeps it safe i dunno  
yeah  
so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the <unk> th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera  
but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side  
try and get <unk> on there and get that tested out  
and you can spend a lot of time talking about the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design  
he we don't know yet with frank if we install this card maybe here  
that's true  
we  
um  
yeah  
uh they are highly interested in the features as you can see uh here  
mm  
throwing away my toothpick  
yes  
uh okay  
make mobile phones and t. v. remotes to make t. v. remotes  
that's it  
um so if i if i kind of <unk> everything we've de we we said  
that's uh  
okay  
yeah  
it's like uh in  
yeah  
it's  
yeah  
it depends where you put your screen because the screen is uh seven inch so it depends on you where where you put it  
didn't you say so  
when you are not close to the t. v. you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so i am i am voting for <unk> to stick to the um infra red control instead of r. w. but we will discuss it later maybe  
well then i come to my uh personal preferences  
but do you think what they <unk> suggested <unk> possibility  
yeah  
yeah  
for the gamma estimation  
um well a lot of those buttons are blue based  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
we have the better re i don't know  
okay  
yep  
mm i guess that would make more sense yeah  
yeah  
not that we actually know anything about it but we can we can pretend  
and then you can do some uh maybe higher level um analysis where you get the pitch of the person or  
not really no  
mm  
where do you buy 'em from  
yeah  
so it's just uh i i think that's  
that's right it's it yeah  
um refer to the <unk> for all <unk> spellings and <unk> for things like filled pauses  
computer adjusting  
are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things  
it's it's pointless  
yes but you could put  
it's something that uh is a pretty good idea  
so you're getting something out of me  
<unk> okay  
yeah  
well  
and things  
mm  
he's a little bit stoned there  
this is it  
why  
okay  
very good  
<unk>  
i'm sure this would be the unique design the market  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
it is just you know it is not the most important but  
mm yeah and i think  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
well i don't know  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh  
uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh <unk> couple of main questions are the buttons  
the emission line data shows strong  
no  
yeah  
it's not because i don't like you but <unk> we have lunch break and then we can work for thirty minutes  
is that what <unk> what you've got because um because the different meeting series overlap  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah it is  
it smells so bad  
yeah  
it will be cooler to have the <unk> rather than the the <unk>  
two  
it it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions in this question  
it has to be uh <unk> baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh  
we we're not building a universal remote we're not building a high end product  
we'll be available  
just just for the call and find thing  
yeah  
short words make sure with little words like the and uh little articles and that kind of thing don't get omitted  
so start  
the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good it should have a fancy look and foo feel good  
but it there's that's what's circulating around the the group as a whole at the moment  
um so i mean like it is an age group to target really i think  
mm-hmm very good  
maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat and then the rest is like  
yes  
yeah  
okay  
well with the one handed design you also have the the problem of the size <unk> 'cause you know from cell phones they can be too small  
so are you basing it on certain thresholds uh over a special <unk> uh <unk> okay  
the name is caramel  
spongy means it it's like <unk>  
um no it's uh  
like a simple replacement right  
mm mm  
interesting because on the hour it yeah  
yeah  
we're not young <unk>  
that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well  
it's um nine <unk> byte to have i mean should be should be similar to have the words  
that's that you that's what you buy yourself  
so the user could be looking at the t. v. and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t. v. to respond  
<unk> is what they really would have wanted apparently  
mm  
so uh you can have my project in  
yeah maybe you can just see how many how many harmonics  
you know take some theory that seems fairly reasonable and think about the particular data and come and talk  
a um a nest a place to live exactly  
yeah  
uh i agree <unk> but  
okay  
it's not good to use  
so now is it f. eight again to escape  
and then also you don't even need batteries because you can make it uh chargeable  
yeah they're light  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
mm that's definitely two  
so  
mm  
yeah  
twelve and a half i think  
and we have the i i don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the  
i mean suppose if the need really arises and it comes to a point where we do have a lot of people  
yeah i think the jog dial you know it just after you drew that what if it was flat and you just spun it that'd be great  
so that's it  
<unk> on top  
yeah if you take just the original phase and the  
or more uh design they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera  
mm-hmm  
<unk> sure  
oh yeah two two bucks  
okay um  
not with an l. c. d.  
yeah exactly  
or is it documented like why they did it they way they did it  
tim had uh tim what kinda line width did you have  
like uh  
sorted  
you don't want it to resemble a banana  
went good  
this uh these are cameras so are these  
yeah yeah  
and yeah  
no  
it's just a simple what is it  
yeah then only we can relate it with something  
okay  
so um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here this is a eighteen pin um uh chip i dunno  
yeah not for each meeting series  
i'm i'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap  
kind of  
cool  
and eighty percent of the people they are always <unk> i mean they are willing to spend more money  
yeah  
but maybe can we we can think something smart about it  
yeah yeah  
right  
well this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid this isn't one that i've just arbitrarily decided on  
hello hello mister p. m.  
hmm  
thank you everybody  
well we <unk> have the you know we can't say channel and it changes the channel channel eight  
uh yeah  
yeah we have some child lock or something yeah  
when do we get together again  
yeah yeah  
it's something  
so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different  
what if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um  
there that's derived you're right  
another question  
i don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here  
well it's not very <unk> either do you know  
yeah we did two of those didn't we  
this meeting is officially over  
mm  
okay well that uh that can be done  
yep  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so might might worth us us having a look at that and just just seeing what dat is what data is already in the ascii format and whether you want me to do any correction as part of the analysis  
i if it  
there's a a gum gum to  
okay  
hmm  
and <unk> what can we think a supplement to  
no it's uh  
so everybody is okay with the new requirements  
mm-hmm  
not much buttons  
yeah yeah yeah  
but i think th uh as it is it's <unk> extracted uh without uh using sub shots uh it's simply uh five down sam yeah down sampling  
i think that i would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat  
oh yeah sorry  
um  
that uh uh <unk> approximating hilbert envelope by opal model  
button supplements they'll be in a special colour of black  
interchangeable  
'kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast  
something we didn't talk about yes yet or  
just by moving it yeah  
why is that so uh expensive  
two <unk> almost true or close to true so that was four points  
okay  
so if it takes off then we'll we'll we'll try that out  
i'm pretty sure there is  
um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing so i'll go into the diagram first  
if if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume because maybe people do not always want to use their voice um  
okay  
yeah mm as far as creativity is concerned yeah i think there was there was room for creativity  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
if it <unk> our what we want to do and things like that  
no you wouldn't  
i think it's uh it's best to draw oh green  
uh <unk> ergonomics are all considered  
and we <unk> created techniques that allow to starts from the text there and the things that are said and <unk> if we find context  
you know these things  
no no no no you don't have two clustering of of of marbles  
yeah  
but in two years you know if we want to do if we want to build a c. t. i. or transfer technology and something like this  
physically at different places yeah  
okay  
like plastic uh your your i usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap  
and the extra parts don't appear  
'cause i would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in <unk> didn't even think about adding more  
'cause that's not too hard  
sweet  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i stayed i stayed two days before so uh i went you <unk> you just take the train maybe that's the same i'm not sure  
okay  
i'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy  
but it's fast  
so one and a half  
right  
mm  
mm-hmm  
because oh this is oh this is one okay  
that's the meeting over  
mm  
you press that first and then you go one three yeah  
let this uh wonderful thing  
fourier  
having the transcription there and <unk> just play it back to a bunch of captive undergraduates and say when do they stop and start  
there is it's just it is a question of and how much ca <unk> does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money  
okay  
um <unk> and <unk> and that's a that's quite a minority there so yeah it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent  
i think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem <unk> remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe  
it took li it like the third time 'til i thought oh you're saying f. five  
yeah  
so at th in the morning all the machines were were just stuck  
it's also copy paste from what we made together  
sure  
yeah i think it's the same as in the cell phone just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons and not for  
yeah  
either this way or this way that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out  
um well this is what i would call our luxury model  
so we give it seven and we write  
yeah okay okay  
it's that they kind of have pages of similar um types  
mm  
yeah  
'cause at the moment it's got quite nice property that the dialogue act number also coincides with the array index number in the array of dialogue acts  
what's teletext  
yes the instinct says true  
okay  
that's my idea  
no  
do we know that  
you can uh put in normal <unk> rechargeable <unk> but they can also be recharged with the remote with a wire  
yeah if you want you can look at his code and  
sometimes an arrow pointing down which may suggest volume down could become confused just as a v. for volume  
and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer just think of those lawsuits that'd be really bad  
because because like posters is you can spend a lot of time posters looking at <unk> many posters than sitting twenty minutes for one oral presentation  
might even have to come in in the evening  
that's a <unk> of data  
i think this is okay the so we have the basic  
yeah  
yeah everything's mushroom  
very much so  
we can decide  
i guess that's gonna be important in the <unk> defining the the software side of the interface right  
yep  
and i don't uh i don't think twenty five euros for a remote is really cheap or something  
uh his own  
yeah  
okay  
it <unk> sounds little bit worse  
yeah  
no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but  
depends where  
you must say it  
we we do want to reach  
mm  
i the  
thank you  
my idea was just to have it be kind of like a  
requires  
yeah  
but we will uh have <unk> that will be distant  
right  
do we know where we stand on that yet  
right  
true  
okay  
yeah  
they should uh different  
uh-huh yep  
yes yes  
i thought it was david burns look into the eyeball  
yes  
okay  
but yeah it'll be there  
um once again i will try to uh write some minutes which i just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder  
is that um the retrieval of t. v. <unk> by content because uh that is really innovative  
alright  
okay  
well you'd uh sure  
mm-hmm  
they might be detected as another another source  
well she has an extra yeah  
possibly yeah  
yeah  
yes  
uh the there's another thing um uh this was new but i haven't thought about this too much  
i mean uh <unk> i don't know about the other projects you have to do  
yeah  
no  
maybe more  
mm  
mm-hmm  
well  
they're clearly there easy to use  
yeah  
so it's not so mm  
everybody seems to miss those some more than others  
oh okay well  
yeah yeah kinda like that yeah  
just as a a backup or just so that people can uh <unk> <unk> just sit there pressing buttons  
is a <unk> is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um  
i think you know <unk> most of you know  
doesn't like silk  
well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand  
uh the sensor using all of its all of its products all of its buttons and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying  
very true is it very true or isn't that true  
um digital telephones uh for example one unit has of course you have to have that base unit  
now what we're not quite sure is what's the best way for like how the <unk> works  
yeah  
useful  
yes  
and if you put in uh noise altogether it sounds like a whispered speech uh but you understand perfect  
and it works pretty well and then the signal is not uh just uh whispered  
let's talk about money  
um and also i mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in  
i mean i it's not an accusation  
uh bits of it yeah  
it's not okay  
um anyway  
uh chip on print and case  
yeah it's clear  
mm-hmm  
so maybe we <unk> we will be able to  
um i think to record it and uh i haven't been asked to submit it yet  
which imply good uh team performance  
um it also has to be simple which to some extent goes along <unk> with the first one  
it doesn't tell you you know some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know not the  
mm-hmm  
maybe more complex yeah  
so so  
yeah i'm thinking of the airport portal you know like that little pod looking thing  
but  
yeah the the thing we saw  
and then after that there's um a number like o. o. one o. o. two  
we i assume the the <unk>  
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's a good point  
<unk>  
you can start  
um so raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products  
well i'll uh start just with another presentation so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting  
yeah apparently yeah maybe also yeah i tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form  
maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion <unk> were important so maybe um just like a little <unk> line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour  
yeah  
great  
so we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume  
but uh when the speaker is uh <unk> uh is uh talk about what he feels what he thinks  
and then just i can change that to work on whatever  
yes  
that is  
that you know as part of the the and <unk> well why do i think this  
with a cradle radio transmitters  
um i don't know what cost implications there are in that  
and move back to here  
right  
it's and so so jo morgan was <unk> only half joking  
that's the  
and like solar power backup and everything then we wouldn't have been able to afford that  
and what happen with uh radio waves when two <unk> have the same have our remote control for example  
power  
<unk> <unk> we can never get uh below the twelve and a half  
um yeah  
people are coming on a should be able to very easily uh use some um resources offered to them  
you will be the manager yeah  
you're the project manager  
remote control is a stupid thing  
small buttons here for some extra functions so if your basic <unk> here we should like we decided before <unk> up and down  
so  
again now now now even they're also becoming yeah  
oh but we don't have any buttons  
yeah  
hmm  
well uh you can guess what it is i hope  
maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then  
so maybe <unk> uh you could present a different work uh you have done  
yeah i dunno  
do we make a menu  
so we've already got you know he's gonna um construct a list of the references he thinks is important  
with a sliding window  
<unk>  
ah  
yeah yeah  
yeah yeah  
i mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group i think but  
yeah  
okay  
like i i know i use that often enough  
um  
and when you try to open it it will be opened easily  
um we didn't really reach a very good agreement on the distribution of these two rooms  
you know just like quick questions quick thoughts whatever it probably would be bit easier  
like broad line radio galaxies  
no no  
mm-hmm  
shape  
hopefully yeah  
but  
okay  
either of you want to uh say anything  
you wanna start us off  
hmm  
i think you can do it both ways  
so  
<unk> yes  
so the channel switching  
yeah it it has yeah it has to be user friendly  
uh with uh yellow and black  
uh  
yep  
one maybe yeah  
um  
not a a <unk> feature as such <unk> on its own  
i think so  
so  
rabbits don't come in blue but you know  
i would like to make a decision  
well it has the wee jog dial but  
okay  
yeah the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job david maybe  
sorry do you want me to  
well if you <unk> uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think i should change the innovative or add other features  
but for notes it i you you have to put that in a strict uh you have to put a name standard date and all those things  
six  
right  
yeah  
they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort  
the word you are going to present  
okay let's just save this so i can <unk> mail it to you  
so we don't actually have to go for  
was it it wasn't just a prototype  
about people if someone is leaving or if someone uh maybe it would be something <unk> uh quite complex even for you  
won't that be a problem with the l. c. d. screen  
i think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that  
i think this doesn't change that much  
so if he got features then it's okay otherwise if he has to generate again he can't generate  
then it's very difficult to get it well like fine if it's one disk it's fine because at least one is having the uh mirror mirror  
and uh a menu uh button  
and uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh <unk>  
uh i don't think we should make it too small i 'cause i think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward  
just uh press it  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm mm 'kay  
yeah  
that's it  
so tomorrow  
hmm  
i dunno that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place  
<unk> fielding off some more spam and  
that aren't allowed  
that's important  
maybe you can make for for channel changing two little buttons on the side of the remote so you can just do like this  
then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines and the users send the <unk> and based on that  
uh-huh  
so this this is so the screen is positioned over here  
yeah  
the the okay  
which has basically the keys are pretty much the same  
um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are  
so <unk> <unk> is working  
they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b. b. c. one  
yeah  
i'll tell you why that's important to me  
yeah  
i i would say no because it's gonna add too much to the price  
special form  
yeah okay  
that was it  
this should be uh accommodated with some software uh uh  
basically the idea is to send a message to the t. v. set as <unk> has pointed  
yeah  
yeah  
i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into  
yeah definitely  
single curve  
yeah yes yeah okay  
mm  
you know subtitles mute there's a lotta buttons that i've got no idea what they do like  
'kay  
um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have  
and what do we  
yeah and see how it turns out  
mm-hmm  
and it would sort of you know keep it quite fancy as well i don't know  
okay  
just hopefully as part of the output it will be something like that  
uh  
like a radio type <unk> situation  
you you put that into audio  
so just that sort of topics a hierarchical concept where like a topic where there can be super topics and topics  
um  
i didn't see anything about uh who had to start  
that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it <unk> maybe at least five  
we should have a back up plan of just a really good television remote control  
yeah it's a double r. but  
yeah  
okay  
right  
don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use  
okay  
yeah  
well yeah i mean it's really basic looking isn't it  
that's your department you'll have to sort that out  
well the  
nah  
it gets handed over to another department  
mm  
so  
but i don't think it's there uh yeah um do we want to um use an l. c. d. display for example  
kind of if i  
the the the yellow row is the amount of  
okay  
very cool nice job  
i mean if the if the microphone is good  
yeah that's the channel  
or can we yeah mm-hmm  
yeah yep  
oh it's all part of the same component that does that  
although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles and then use that  
yeah  
briefly it's supposed to be a seal  
especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something  
yeah also  
oh yeah  
yes  
i don't know what which doesn't help  
it does prefer ones from the beginning because it just picks the first ones it finds  
f. v. low <unk> is a source type  
yep  
so it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together you know  
hide them okay  
yeah  
the most precise one is the <unk> in the horizontal plane  
um there was some research on new features in a remote control  
yeah i guess they do  
yep  
okay  
but a poster i might do  
so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels  
this one  
um <unk> could you do the same please  
well th the f. p. g. a. will produce the the data to send  
maybe i hope so  
yellow and grey  
<unk> okay  
yeah  
i'll write down our scores up on the  
oh okay  
yeah yeah  
okay  
mm yeah  
okay  
like on the the mouse  
mm that's true  
mm  
yeah yeah  
so i guess three things um cost um complexity and the size  
<unk>  
these these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things  
i love the smell of that play doh  
this is just crazy  
the the problem most of the time we've seen the keys is that it's small  
hmm  
okay uh the method  
i i th i think i should  
um i don't understand enough of what their data structure is  
it's not a one though  
moving along swiftly  
and  
yeah  
four i think  
because it's it's a fact that when you are having one utterance  
yeah  
that was our main technological innovation <unk> every everything else was fairly simple but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new  
then there wouldn't be uh a big problem  
we'll go back uh tomorrow  
i mean a although it will be a closed domain i mean we we can't use any domain information necessarily  
i've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a <unk> yeah a partial  
yes of course  
is too complicated for most users  
so every every frame on the <unk> page is uh online  
okay  
well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control there is no other function that i can see  
x. m. l. uh well it's per c. g. i. that output x. m. l. and x. s. l.  
yeah  
could you do your presentation  
it sounds like the <unk> something that we  
okay but uh we have  
oh  
not all the small buttons you don't know  
<unk> heidi who is the gesture of autism  
for uh browsing i mean  
no that's just one  
yeah  
so you actually have to be <unk> have to show at some time slice rate whether the eye was on the same target as the other guy  
oh  
yeah  
uh like but using how many batteries for example  
the yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine where basically you can program a sample <unk> um  
um to discourse marker dis f. marker <unk> point five  
well that's well that's that's what they're at the moment  
just little things like that which would need to be made clear in the design  
as an  
so the file is huge and they really need uh um they have a long post processing to convert raw file to uh <unk> or to our own files  
mechanism  
all the the materials from the case uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story  
okay one piece yeah  
what do <unk>  
so if you scratch it it's still the same colour perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged  
yeah  
i think you can think about a yellow t. v. now after a fruit t. v. or i dunno  
yeah because our target is sixteen to forty five  
and the one with with a menu has an l. c. d.  
i did the same for kayak you say kayak in fact now it's kayak and then you can see  
and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity few buttons we've uh  
so that that's strange  
and sends the message to the receiver  
okay  
because if you i had a square design  
okay is the is this is this <unk> is this <unk> anxiety robin  
it's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in <unk> um in use  
yeah  
and also does it uh fit well in hand  
and then we will move to <unk> conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved  
do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that  
so we would perhaps have to make one that's similar  
but it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this and you can make it another shape but then you have  
yeah  
so yeah  
well i'd be inclined to say if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost  
because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult  
'cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh i mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a  
<unk> and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy feeling remote controls  
so these are the <unk> uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote  
and that's uh fifteen twenty five  
it's on the desktop  
they will take half a year before they would even <unk> what it is  
yeah and that's good  
mm  
yeah  
it lights up for  
okay  
yeah  
right  
so  
yeah  
uh yeah  
when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello  
so th it's something <unk>  
um maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control  
so uh <unk> single curved  
is it easy to use  
i think we all made um very significant contributions i don't think anybody dominated it which i thought was really good  
'cause this one makes the angle either like this  
so my my feeling is that we <unk> do want to observe this trend  
no  
are you uh <unk> are you joining in with this meeting here or are <unk> or are <unk> or are you are you just are you just uh doing some internet shopping there  
okay  
if i one button is still one more button  
mm 'kay  
mm  
these are the probabilities that that a document is about uh this theta one is the probability that this document is about topic one  
so that's just this one just <unk> this is the banana curve  
what effect  
mm-hmm  
um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one  
i dunno  
i can't did you could you see it on you screen when it  
and that's enough to to keep the energy level uh  
that's great  
yeah  
the remote control offers enough features  
one of the great uh advantages of the l. c. d. screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh <unk> some cleaning stuff  
just  
i mean just to see what it looks like in p. d. f. format or something  
um they're not very attractive to look at and they're not very comfortable to hold  
because if if the t. v. turns on itself it well you know if the time the timer should be there  
right  
next to the control button on the bottom and then f. eight at the top  
okay cheers  
mm-hmm  
sorry  
but like what i can do is um  
ah okay sure okay well <unk>  
not that watching t. v. should be that stressful  
or so with a high power usage we would  
yeah  
three presentation yeah  
means losses are emotional as well as whatever it is there  
device <unk>  
okay  
i just wanna know it works the way you expect it to work  
yeah i agree  
no uh um  
and you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that  
emotion the involvement in a discussion  
the keeping keeping the same algorithm and the same way of handling it and just saying like just this this topic here i uh it happens to be like a whole meeting and it has sort of sub topics  
mm  
yeah  
made our decisions about uh  
huh  
so um have you looked at nate <unk> work  
this is a bit frustrating at the moment this project isn't it  
yeah so it should be i mean if you have it in your hand here should be on top somewhere maybe  
all the way to the top yeah that's up to desktop  
whereas if you got fish  
sure  
and you can store the energy in the in the thing  
oh yeah look at that  
but there's not a way to compute that i mean since we saved on the on the production cost  
two thousand three yeah  
uh  
we have to present  
mm  
nope  
go go  
we we just want to build a more uh adult <unk> adult version of of this  
mm-hmm  
oh  
well i just i i i it's i think this is  
scribble away  
yeah  
it's like you see uh one to twenty you go uh uh <unk> scroll up and push number <unk> twenty  
right well  
it's not good  
cool  
so from the bottom or whatever is there uh the uh the numbers and then the top  
uh what i also  
no  
the u. i. guy also uh work on that yeah and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs  
yeah we could do that  
before  
yeah  
well if it's for young people um like the phone generation  
hmm  
yeah  
so it's that that's what i've seen  
okay cool  
but i don't  
like some t. v. <unk> they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons  
most  
but for you it might be 'cause we're only interesting in getting the speech  
apply some pressure  
so they'll include things like the um the eye tracker calibration right which is not a bad thing actually  
it's the same menu as we have saw that ipod remote control  
six point point about six point five  
which will probably just usurp what i said so  
but on the on the on the server the original is a <unk> video film  
yes it can  
yeah  
um  
one's true and okay  
uh-huh  
now is background  
yeah  
yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time i want to watch the movie and  
oh just wait a little bit  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
so four five ten thirteen thirteen  
you can see they are very different  
no  
yeah  
maybe we can  
but in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
right  
that more points came out from your presentation even  
okay  
yeah but  
mm i was thinking of the  
hmm  
mm  
yeah  
yeah but i mean you don't  
yeah but i i really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing  
i mean the general division was language here and other stuff there right  
okay so mm  
i'd say three so two it is then or  
cool  
okay  
we have the design somewhere  
i don't have the c. files also presently with me  
th that is so  
so hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way  
format  
well i could look 'cause i i've got that there's the list isn't there of post graduates i maintain in in linguistics  
um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board  
if you see that there is a continuous change of the <unk> distance you don't do a threshold  
what other  
yeah  
yeah  
um and we should each have a presentation to make  
yeah yeah  
that's true  
yeah  
you're still learning to drive actually so that just costs more than a car but yeah  
um it's <unk> it's just that that's that's quite a quick way to just to get into how how works  
uh those uh nine uh is the fancy looking  
um easy to use  
it is a banana  
i think it would be like an hour or two's work  
you have to <unk> sort of remember  
it's i think it's going to appear more more and more and uh  
yeah yeah  
have  
we need the advanced yeah  
yeah we we need to i mean  
uh uh  
it's single curves  
you will not compare each mic with uh all the other one  
it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up right so it opens on the side  
i'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever so i'm gonna start soon we have now don't have much time anyway  
so if you have the voice recognition you can you can programme like thirty uh um  
would that be like the segments file giving a start word and end word or or would that  
uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons then that would be fine  
no that's <unk>  
and then the lower part is titanium  
we we yeah we still need to take in account the the bit older people  
yeah  
yeah okay  
i know  
okay we are <unk> mm  
after all i think personally i would give a two  
is this a t. v. one we are supposed to make  
here  
okay  
um i'm gonna go for the dog and i'm gonna draw one badly as well  
so you have to stop it and start it to make any effect  
okay  
it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted  
i <unk> like would just i would find logical reasons for why you can <unk> say <unk>  
i like the yellow illumination idea very good  
yeah  
press it on top  
special colour  
it's uh related to uh that frequency of the broad band or how it's called  
okay they should be <unk> <unk> they should be in mind wasn't it  
so yeah  
uh i it's also going to be a problem uh because you're going to have one part or a construct forming in the middle of a fixation  
yep  
can you read that  
okay  
i just got a few slides so show them  
so uh say about a two for fancy you think  
lose  
yeah yeah  
it it's not bad  
let's go and check  
not like this <unk> we're just giving the fruit for more <unk> and more attraction too  
um also had i not been intrigued about the pen i don't think i <unk> used it at all i didn't write barely anything  
we want back lit buttons  
like a sponge  
now it's really big competition  
it's like a it's like a nasa you know they use four eight four eight six  
shall we abandon the whole notion of seeing the whole <unk> one whole group as one single thing and just work on a <unk> certainly from now on probably for good that means  
and the utterances then say which topic they belong to  
yeah  
there's always ways to lose things  
uh will people return the remote control  
where would you put it  
i mean maybe it's possible for for twelve euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the  
and it's only for televisions  
and we call that the pas  
um i've established what the components required for the remote control to function actually are  
well don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now  
nine  
you <unk> you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that but when the banana is curving like that  
e. r.  
especially last time yeah  
what do we have here  
yeah yeah yeah  
we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work  
so th the  
um there are some advantages and some disadvantages and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques which uh i think our customers will like  
yes for the remote  
no  
i dunno  
yeah it's a bit more fun isn't it  
ah no no  
yeah  
yeah we just have to go all what we did today again  
f. five  
yeah  
you do f. f. t. on each mic  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
the buttons should uh also be not too small not too big of course and uh <unk> uh uh not too close uh together  
it's ours  
in one sorry  
spongy  
yeah  
uh or it involves too many things that you cannot keep under control given the other things you have to do  
uh if you look at the shape it's uh just a simple long box uh shape  
yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life then  
and old users not  
right  
i agree on that  
i can easy go off the train and early and just pick 'em up from there  
let me see if i can do that right now  
yeah  
yeah  
and you put in the salad  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so we have battery versus cradle  
um  
no let's find uh the way to  
okay  
'kay we're going backwards here now it suddenly crashes and hangs  
yeah  
v. c. r. or something i say it to the t. v. and the t. v.  
because there are no restrictions on physical size  
but in uh yes  
i vote six  
vi violent channel uh <unk> my <unk> my kids uh i don't want my kids to watch that then you set the priority to only parents  
okay  
so on the on the top is better  
or we we had talked about solar power but i thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark  
so it one utterances link up full sentence or something and there might not be much breaks in it  
maybe you'd use some <unk> <unk> stuff as development or something and do some last tweaks and then evaluate  
i don't know  
yeah we should be consistent yeah  
i like it yeah it's  
it's able to talk to you  
okay  
so make it yeah  
channel selection is uh <unk> often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant  
mm  
um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed  
so i just moving around with that ideas  
mm  
um you would assume that they are roughly <unk> not necessarily very precisely and um compare the energy levels  
i think it's more interesting what he says okay  
yeah  
no well yeah i if you would be young  
i think <unk> <unk> with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical so  
they can't replace uh the new parts only appear when the previous one's broken  
i don't think it's important but i think it i think it should be you <unk> you could put it somewhere here  
right  
um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so  
is that an option a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots  
with these new <unk>  
for example the battery energy source or um what if the chip  
oh there we go  
yo  
oh mine is already outdated  
and here's where we get some other documents that all appear to be about the same thing  
it'll make a difference  
and and a volume control also in it  
mm mm mm  
yeah that'll probably be good  
so  
change the contrast on their t. v. and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible but you know  
oh  
right  
pick a pick a pick a clean sheet  
yeah  
cool  
a special colour  
i dunno from who  
then um yeah th th it might be a bit more of a issue  
yeah  
i mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it  
great  
yeah  
<unk> designed by okay  
hmm  
hmm  
um the the cost features  
right  
wow  
yeah channel  
shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive  
but isn't it  
okay  
but the uh th the point is this interface is uh i think six or seven files only  
<unk> plug yourself in here  
yeah  
oh yeah i don't know  
yeah  
oh well that's that's pretty good huh  
is it fashion  
isn't there a name for them  
uh you can be sitting here itself and do the presentation  
yeah  
yeah like a <unk> kind of service centre  
you know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice activated  
what does it mean  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
uh mm-hmm  
yeah  
talk to me about this stuff if i happen to be around at the time that you're doing it and not <unk> so i if the writing stuff down on the <unk> gets to be too high a proportion of things  
the recognition system will be able to understand french  
yeah  
they are individual uh you have different colours for the yep  
one  
yeah  
maybe on the top or even on the side  
but is that is that <unk>  
yeah i th okay on th um yeah <unk> answering the question uh in those terms i'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this  
yeah  
um no it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology yeah  
and um in fact i think the high definition d. v. d. players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback  
no  
yeah it's it's it's around one kilo byte like  
ah it's a it's a compromise no  
then play that part in a compressed way and display density information  
yeah  
but at end of the day we don't look at the technology but we look at the function first  
or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the <unk> only trained for you it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself  
when your parents are watching some boring program you can take the remote and do something else  
um and and we <unk> we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items  
we've  
um we're at sixteen point eight and  
i think a two  
uh so i anyway i had to re to redo all the experiments but now it's a little bit more difficult  
by the way why was your cat uh red  
yeah and you'll get nothing back unless i look at it right  
so why don't you bring it by um next week  
you know here  
you can wear homer you can throw homer when you're frustrated doh  
oh sorry um yep  
go to channel twenty five  
so for example if he want repeated all these results then he <unk> he need to use all ma <unk> p. l. p. configuration then that's really  
um they can easy <unk> our controller among a lot of products  
yeah  
because uh in order for the remote to process something from the t. v. like uh to <unk> and you have to send and receive and that's well  
well  
okay  
um i suppose it doesn't really matter as long as they're unique and it can i can pass 'em back to you and you can use that to the display  
now we're gonna something's gonna have to go  
i <unk> uh and really i don't see how the the l. c. d. display is gonna add anything you know on a design level  
but yeah <unk>  
and i was gonna add another uh slide here but i didn't quite have time there  
they used to not um close the process when you click the cross  
so yellow for the body and then what colour for the buttons  
so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control  
th that uh numbers it's very fast so it's no problem  
yeah it's good idea  
why not yeah  
against bigger frames  
okay  
uh yeah  
mm-hmm that's right  
we have the simplest buttons  
uh yeah  
seeing as ninety percent over ninety percent would pay for it  
maybe if <unk> <unk> if suppose if we change and we <unk> put just one  
and um <unk> just a bit more high tech than than a normal battery  
okay  
but we <unk> then we have to lose the l. c. d. screen  
or not  
yeah  
for the for the launch yeah  
um little standards  
no we have two push buttons  
um  
um so i i i think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store  
we will put that casing onto that mobile phone okay it will look <unk> uh yeah  
very yeah okay very occasionally  
mm  
so that's it  
yeah  
i don't know whistle able  
so the the thing is it's probably an easy task to read that rate but it's probably more difficult to get an event automatically when it's changed  
uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it  
we  
user interface um  
definitely a single maybe a double  
um need to look into whether we can do that but uh i think we we have some <unk> mobile phone based products uh checking quickly our internet  
i don't think so  
yeah so uh so finally we have these three <unk>  
yeah right  
and and this is all tying in very nicely  
one with l. c. d.  
we were coming up with one product  
three  
mm-hmm  
then eighty percent of users would spend more money um  
it's gonna be one <unk> scroll  
i think that would help you pin down what the definitions are  
right okay  
go through them  
so you are display on the screen  
this is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device  
yeah  
okay cool  
ah <unk> see  
and the scroll wheel is i mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference i don't think  
yeah i mean hopefully this week  
yeah  
but you do mention the next and previous uh button  
but either way i think we've made it fairly close to what  
if you have if you have uh  
hmm  
a capture through the projector signal of the slides and they for the moment they just plan to use the slides as a as a way to index the presentations  
um well uh i haven't booked anybody in or anything  
so now we have to think about what we will make  
central  
i depending on how how different the vowel sound was  
we can eventually try to ask to have one person to involve one person that will be dedicated strictly to this  
well mm <unk> well i i i don't really see the advantage of having uh l. c. d. on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen  
this is the one thing that's protecting its innards  
that's a pity because it looks like it's doing something  
and who we all are and stuff like that mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on  
but not black i think  
i was uh wondering yeah yeah maybe  
so i just have one curiosity  
sure  
um two  
alright so  
one moment  
nerd  
i don't like snakes  
no it's i  
well uh we should <unk> build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something  
like <unk>  
or hopefully everything will fall right in line  
so something a bit like that with  
and cluster you're right  
change that  
so you you'd be  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
like big uh <unk> flashy colours  
and you start the other recording on the other machine  
yeah  
yeah  
well  
it <unk> well it i can i can see technical problems with that in terms of the you know  
get back  
yeah  
but uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device so we don't really have to consider that  
so we have to go through now evaluations  
yeah uh <unk> i mean it i just let it run over all the files  
least it's quick  
yes i have put it in  
so i was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea  
<unk> we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours  
we probably did  
it's it's gone wrong  
you could just make it mechanical  
okay  
uh yeah crazy  
i think that's what we decided  
um part of the remote control  
uh  
check your mail  
having a little bit  
so uh so you don't have to put your oh  
so it's not my requirement  
yeah  
you get like a document for each exhibit  
that's true mm 'kay  
can  
is push buttons two words  
all the um cases of ambiguity or whatever  
so it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen uh with a clear menu  
yes  
false  
so <unk> you are the secretary also  
do everything to uh really small but together they're really strong  
go back  
i don't think she cares  
a touch screen like microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi media applications  
no i think they're fine  
how many <unk> how many times before uh the validation worked or something  
yeah  
yes  
so so well and that's that's what i call it  
i think because it's a fairly new thing it's a little hard to say at this point  
yeah  
yes  
so it would yeah have to be constant uh constant signalling  
ah th the gap you mean or no  
yeah until twenty four  
the power required um and the ability to the cost it seems like for uh an embedded system this could cause us issues  
okay  
that way around  
i didn't i didn't think the spinning wheel or the uh l. c. display were were crucial for us  
mm  
<unk> can you get the batteries  
yeah right  
start breaking up  
can you um  
yeah  
okay  
but it will also uh uh use batteries and do we want to  
i'll read out to you  
yeah  
okay excellent  
well but  
because yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime  
oh yeah no that's yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah and the single curved to <unk>  
not one colour but the pattern needs to be <unk>  
what's that purple thing there  
getting lost  
well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this  
yeah you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy  
so actually in a way you guys <unk> maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have  
well you still do  
here's a case of um where i found it <unk> uh found a case of discontinuity  
they had their inspection last week  
i'd give it like three or four  
um okay  
yeah  
because we keep all the features we keep voice recognition we keep l. c. d. display  
hmm  
yeah and the other <unk> other uh functionality is the screen  
i'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that that's that'd stand out  
automatically configure  
yeah  
they certainly do look at other things  
oh  
yeah right  
um okay well uh i just got my warning for the last five minutes  
so we are here for uh for uh functional design  
it's just a a case with two uh metal contacts  
yeah  
i mean that's the point now  
i think so  
i think there's i think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands  
it sounds really easy what does the user do what does the th remote control do but there are quite some issues  
there's nothing more annoying than faded symbols because you don't know which channel is this button so possibly we could find uh something for that yes  
well alright  
batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable  
one of those things  
yeah yeah  
but maybe like not even store the importance levels for individual words and just sort of rank utterances as a whole  
yeah  
that's our overall concept and it's gonna look sort of vegetable and be in bright vegetable colours  
and that's the problem is that you either get smaller desks 'cause the ones that we have now won't fit  
and uh chip set well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons we could go uh with a simple chip set  
next generation does  
whether that's too many results and whether we <unk>  
mm  
although i don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway battery life uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries  
i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise  
oh right okay  
yeah well <unk> you must have  
after  
see there's a role for everybody  
um i think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design  
yeah  
i think so  
um  
that'd be quite nice  
mm-hmm  
thing  
um  
so we have the energy source we have the user interface this this is what i've seen  
yeah <unk> not on the control on the screen on the t. v. screen  
i mean the rubber  
you had an had an idea about the menu  
for this  
no  
too many  
uh first in the power supply we have the option of just the standard battery  
can we uh outsource these from elsewhere um will we have to construct any items ourselves  
uh it's could be  
the word line should be in there  
it's a good idea  
so i'm going to explain that on the board rather  
um  
it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way  
well i mean i think that um <unk> it i don't know uh <unk> it'd probably get to re hear you know  
yeah  
yeah  
in fact they use um  
but to give him the shape of your hand so you it's easier to use or something like that  
like the one you've shown david with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh  
yeah but also for detection  
you probably opened it  
it's what  
they're uh far enough apart and an anything  
yeah sure  
hmm  
yeah  
we have a lot to tell  
that's quite ex well it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality  
mm okay  
there was a yes in there  
mm  
yeah  
you try to <unk> no no no  
whoa it's a little  
well you'll have to work on this one  
so um but those kinds of measures um you know  
<unk>  
<unk> yeah yeah  
the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever  
mm-hmm  
four  
right  
yeah  
i thin  
okay  
mm-hmm  
slide four  
um or there's solar power which we've been considering inside a building which is where it's gonna be used might not be quite so useful  
right i had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get  
mm-hmm  
twelve and half  
<unk> it's got higher centre of gravity like that  
hmm  
most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty so yes  
but uh i was gonna say um yeah fruit and vegetables uh important to this year um important to furniture i'm just gonna say  
maybe there's a button on the cradle  
well but it  
oh it's still too hot  
but i i think this is meant by the digital pen  
that would be the back  
so the buttons <unk> should be that small or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons which one are you going to use  
those are just back channels  
so we have to uh change a little bit uh to that uh so that uh it becomes more user friendly  
yeah  
somewhere like that  
remote controls and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar  
okay  
this is copy paste  
yes but the end product so  
the sample <unk> costs four  
um okay uh i'd <unk> we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes  
is it  
um yeah  
so it's th it's so it's not done on it's so it's not done online  
it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing  
okay  
it would be impossible to make it  
but let's cut the meeting for now yes  
they  
okay  
yeah but but if you display it on l. c. d. screen with <unk> <unk> really big numbers  
we can make it smart like an ipod you know make everything menus  
yeah  
yeah  
oh that's  
i just don't know what it is but  
yeah twelve fifty twelve fifty  
okay  
it's not  
uh um <unk>  
yes  
yeah don't know  
uh-huh  
uh i think so we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well  
then i have all lists  
uh it it's really scary to think about what you could possibly do in an open domain where you don't where you don't know what the tasks are  
i'd like a shaped screen  
didn't put five centimetres  
i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology  
it's kinda hard to find where everything was  
yeah  
uh <unk> uh but it uh unless we just define it as there's only they're they are exclusive  
yeah okay  
this is what they uh what they mean  
yeah  
nah <unk> four i think  
so so is there some somewhere  
yeah  
yeah  
i mean just before  
uh  
i think that's a bit double  
so there are several key features of our <unk> prototype  
so we just buy a circuit board and okay  
okay <unk> <unk> we can <unk> we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready  
i didn't say it was true  
so  
because  
so maybe it's possible uh i don't know whether you can can indicate this  
yeah  
um yeah basically we we <unk> went with the colour yellow  
yeah i think so  
function f. eight  
sixteen  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
like we were playing with the play doh and the ideas came with the play doh rather than with everything else  
and the <unk> is done using this icon here  
'kay  
okay  
so this is coding then <unk> you code the speech then you're also supposed to transmit the speech right  
so  
yeah we <unk> yeah i think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be i'm just gonna do this in my head  
i would have thought that's probably about <unk> well  
yes  
yeah <unk> <unk> what's the <unk>  
she  
just <unk> try to guess who is a user interface designer  
uh i i'd say only the logo  
<unk> right  
no we can we can't use that  
we have decided everything  
mm uh-huh  
so you know that  
but uh th  
so  
now uh button supplement  
yes we can do that  
hmm  
with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part  
yeah but the non removable elements of the of the remote so not the front could be titanium to give that uh strong look  
um so i had so i had to bus people in from like stations either side  
but i think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings  
<unk> just these are the ones you already summed up in the  
and i will add also that we did that on the uh <unk> the words after filtering them from the removing the the stop words  
steep soft component  
so i if robert emails claire and we're <unk> gonna need to decide exactly what she's gonna say on there  
so then i <unk> i did i get a new <unk>  
just <unk> most most modern t. v. <unk> you you press one zero and it goes to ten  
mm-hmm  
yeah i guess that's  
uh  
is it inspired by clothing fashion  
uh 'cause that's what you started with wasn't it  
he has already to do cat  
okay  
um i don't think don't think so  
alright what's next in our agenda  
do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels  
alright please uh go on norman with the special features  
actually the numbers are not uh very reasonable because they are just thirteen p. l. p. features and uh we have to have at least something which is known for people  
mm  
yeah  
and do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain what it shouldn't it should look like or things like that  
and then make the the design a the actual design but i never came around to do that  
do you have  
but the way of course i'm i i don't know exactly what uh the work involves  
to use  
but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling  
yeah  
you and the speaker d.  
it's  
mm-hmm  
put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options so the other options would be gone  
oh  
and and the case is is rubber  
yeah  
but i don't think when you're watching t. v. uh hearing loud noises from the t. v. someone screaming one and you <unk> the channel switches uh yeah  
i have no idea how but uh yeah  
three  
so i could just extract the highest ones for each segment  
oh uh-huh  
yay  
on the side  
or think  
mm  
mm  
yep  
i twelve and a half  
<unk> <unk> wood  
that's why i had to wanted to go first  
i don't think it's very expensive  
and um well we began with uh with a form of shape  
so uh there is uh already uh an f. f. t. uh module implemented in it  
yeah  
couple of descriptions of the interior  
stuff like that  
so perfect  
yeah they do  
entree  
kind of a green banana now  
so you use the first and last point to detect what is between  
we have uh different options uh concerning the cases  
<unk> we need we need we need <unk> some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff but  
th then we still have too much  
this one is this one the middle one  
yeah  
mm  
but even so you're likely to get bouncing in and out of the region right  
uh well that would bring the <unk> <unk> some more costs but i mean the  
that's one of our key goals we wanna promote our product  
so you will have to draw the line somewhere  
and uh i you know i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually <unk> it uh to whatever they want  
what i thought um even young people say it's hard to use  
so you just do whatever you like and uh doesn't care what it costs  
it's field programmable uh something array  
but you can of course erase when you make a mistake but don't uh delete entire pages  
buttons on top of it  
you think  
or it's you know it's twenty milliseconds more than that one  
yeah that makes sense  
slide show  
and then all this amplitude  
okay  
the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing  
if  
where there is light only when when there are people but  
yeah  
yeah  
um <unk> <unk> um and all the rest are either p. h. d. students or master students  
no  
mm yeah  
right mm-hmm  
okay  
okay  
mm-hmm  
no i i  
well we <unk> we can do it glow in the dark  
where have i put it  
yeah  
so  
that's that decided  
that's not a mouse <unk> no  
oh i'm sorry oh sorry  
only like only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an  
mm that's expensive  
<unk> no that'll be controlled by the those <unk> be there already yeah  
uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose  
yeah  
and uh um uh so uh so what next in on top of it what you are going to build i mean is the question now  
and then back to the one i was before so there's whichever it was  
and chocolate  
i think um  
yes  
maybe we should re evaluate uh the product but we did that before and we also evaluated the project  
yeah what about price is that gonna go on there as well  
and it's very easy uh to find your remote control  
okay  
mm mm  
yeah button will be on the upper side buttons will be the on the upper side  
mm-hmm  
much more than the other way around right  
mm  
yeah  
oh okay  
okay right  
and that's pretty much yeah  
yes  
we're just using the the very beep simple beep that <unk> that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything  
i think so  
if it can be afforded  
two point four yeah so it's a bit less because the amplitude is much smaller yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so we need to take care of them in the design  
well i think th i think the design and technology has to come back and say  
they want us to decide  
and most all because of the option to whoa  
that's not really <unk> easy  
no i think the display has a method for that ready which is called  
so i basically came up with an algorithm that's just a i it plugs p. l. s. a. uh plugs page rank into p. l. s. a.  
lemon you know definitely food for thought there but keep going and we'll discuss it after  
what is it putting fashion into electronics or something i dunno  
yeah  
okay and back button  
um  
nah th it's too expensive  
so i i it it that's that's going to be <unk> uh it's it's not just a single point  
so when are you gonna bring this beautiful baby in to see everybody  
i hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh <unk>  
okay when it comes to the chip on print as i said the the more advanced features you want  
okay  
so if we uh if uh if we you can hold him to his word  
i think there's thirty talks and and say six ten posters whatever we can manage to fit in the room  
i think we we can we  
so the two person could come up with very different one is very interesting i in  
so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process <unk> been a good idea  
right  
so  
and then the uh you know the the overall design of the case uh is is is <unk> field and uh  
so um but i've i've sent it out for review so that <unk> anyone who is gonna using the format can have a look at it  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
look more looks more like a campfire  
like as a as a proportional factor of of its original length is a good way of going about it  
plastic with a with a special colour  
we want something that looks good  
yeah he suggested that we could have an uh initial prototype  
we only use the phase between the microphones  
i just write midi  
and yeah  
uh h. alpha detection  
well that's that's reassuring  
um does this is this dependent on shape or what it's made of or what  
even if it's in general fashion we want it to be in the remote control  
we understand  
solar  
fine  
so are we going for the <unk> are we going for the simple one are we  
um on my report i didn't uh ish i didn't show it in my uh presentation because my computer crashed  
you can put both the scores in one file if it makes it easier  
surely they they should <unk>  
well other case we can make it single curved or <unk>  
mm-hmm okay  
so we can't erase anything  
yeah  
it calculated such that if you don't have the word it doesn't affect to a great degree the the the word error rate  
now we just gotta calculate  
feel and design kendra the uh  
so mine's like that as well  
mm-hmm  
it is very light  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
'cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons  
so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go  
marketing yeah expert  
it's um  
it's just what i'm worrying it <unk> worried about is him being in the lab all day long and you not being sure like what to do for the analysis on or something  
so uh to gather my research two basic methods  
yeah i just <unk> use the douglas adams uh uh that that book you know the mm how it's called  
yeah  
i uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products  
mm well tab doesn't usually have music notations just um pitch information  
um but not necessarily on the <unk> the normal remote  
i th i think it's not it's not like it's a pen  
mm  
i would have <unk> it if it were the right colours of course  
um david mentioned also that there should be some kind of gender balance  
basically the process is ready and we can start having our demo  
and and the utterances referenced to those topics i guess  
mm-hmm  
we have twenty five minutes for this meeting  
and this can be all sorts of <unk> messages turn it on turn it off uh change the channel adjust volume that kind of thing  
okay okay  
yeah i mean there's one series that has just one meeting  
that will not  
so the construct actually um has say it has six things that are added to some initial thing okay  
yeah  
no actually  
yeah  
yeah  
i'm gonna give you  
and the rubber would just be the what's in contact with the human  
and it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple you think computers like apple mac  
so just move to the next slide  
mm-hmm  
cheap  
so much like a single one zero variable change that it if it that doesn't already exist  
actually <unk> uh she used some a a a bunch of features to do the automatic parsing  
okay  
mm i think you're supposed to yeah  
mm  
is that all the colours we add or  
okay so based on that yeah um where is the es okay sample speaker  
i thought about banana or something like that which is fruits and  
what  
because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too  
oh um you can clip them to your belt  
mm-hmm  
so i can  
okay  
and you can choose colours on your day for each day or even many colours  
yeah  
i think that's a good idea  
no it's new  
fancy look and feel has on a score of seven would have six as importance  
shall i uh  
uh uh  
any more uh  
two  
uh i <unk> i can't imagine  
we can sell it in united states  
yeah  
as it is  
but um so that's good anyway  
there needs to be some kind of selling point to it  
mm-hmm  
yeah but then i <unk> i don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half  
maybe you you know some at least a good book that's uh dealing with this stuff  
um if you would if you look at the uh <unk> <unk> <unk> what we could do to make it more um  
um well i have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps  
um but no i think it's better if i just send you the link it's probably simpler  
okay  
maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit  
well but we know that we're having at least three colours so  
although it might be if you want to um ex extract these features like pitch and uh rate of speech or energy simply from each person  
okay  
no no no  
i because we don't want a lot a <unk> yeah a device self <unk> <unk>  
no no  
yeah i think what basically what i need at is um just a list of words with an index to start with for each meeting  
yeah  
yeah  
it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies  
detailed design oh come on  
yeah  
yeah normal  
i was wondering if that got there okay  
but and but it <unk> it doesn't have to be annoying that when you uh know some things is just over the top  
right  
so it's really light as well  
yeah  
let's say i put my mouse over this line here and then it would tell me something about what it is  
<unk>  
i mean at that point it becomes pretty much crucial the kind of uh data you have in the sense that for the way we have collected the data some way i don't know if it can be at the same time too easy in the sense that some way you have little groups of meetings extremely correlated  
i think uh that was like in when we were still in the seminar room  
uh yeah it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative  
alright  
okay so you can  
yeah  
'kay  
i think it was good  
oh that's really nice  
if you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed or you throw this remote control under your bed is it better <unk>  
or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone so you you hold it in one hand and you press the buttons with your thumb  
then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against  
so if you pressed it and went up  
yeah <unk> we will see  
quite old  
a thought and it it cuts out uh  
i <unk> i think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation  
um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let  
very visual intended  
so it <unk> it will just <unk>  
um kate to do the components for  
it takes at least one or two weeks  
yeah we should keep that simple too  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's understandable okay  
we may do  
yeah  
'cause they <unk> they <unk> have actually run things and to uh get an idea of the sort of style and to check that they'd be alright  
are you talking about the picture  
yeah i was thinking you can  
mm  
so  
yep  
it's easy to use  
i think you <unk> can just get probabilities for a certain words for each document  
and then um <unk> the other <unk> points are robust and <unk> reminder  
oh not  
is it  
but uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase  
yeah  
and then with these buttons <unk> <unk> you navigate  
mm-hmm  
no  
and that's still uh uh yeah is is uh is a little personal touch i guess  
the method i used was  
yeah rechargeable batteries  
so powerful  
already thought about something <unk>  
yeah  
they may not have pictures but maybe they do  
we have the power button  
about the project  
yeah i think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape  
and the two uh aspect uh models  
um does everyone understand this  
mm-hmm  
i think more i think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions  
the budget  
right  
so it's <unk> it has to look nice and feel nice and and have all the functions that uh  
i think well okay no problem  
yeah  
okay  
compared to <unk>  
so you will have to use the colour of the product of the um um  
adjust with phones yes  
um no this is for pay more for speech recognition  
yeah  
i'm allergic to cats  
mm-hmm  
mm  
no i don  
go ahead  
yeah  
uh uh it <unk> it took a long time to decide what kind of material  
yeah  
sorry  
oh really  
huh  
and so how many how many posters and talks are we gonna actually gonna get in  
mm-hmm  
no one yet  
mm-hmm  
yes  
it might be  
that not not everything in one one uh folder  
yeah  
so again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the r. r.  
no six  
the the most people uh <unk> find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control  
the one to keep yeah  
so whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote  
like i said susan and maggie in the individual offices  
mm  
that's sorted back to the main  
something like  
also it's kind of spongy <unk> is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age  
so i guess the case would be plastic with  
okay  
hey that that's an idea  
okay  
oh i see  
right  
but we need more  
hmm  
uh yes  
no  
is there a particular shape that you're interested in  
yes  
if there is market uh interest uh in in more than one country  
well i see but  
b. b. c. one  
well i tried once but that was not allowed  
um we already got <unk> through opening and partially through acquaintance  
minutes of the previous meeting  
warning finish meeting now  
um including the integrated circuit which is also known as the chip  
then it might be that then we are gonna have to uh contact bob and say bob these three of your students are gonna be talking  
so that about finance  
how much would you give on the fancy aspect on the fashionable aspect  
um  
mm  
so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation maybe give it a five i would say  
anyway it's very in general i think people uh change t. v. more often than batteries of their remote control  
yeah  
i dunno  
<unk> oh i see  
you can buy a different kind of of of machine but it's the same thing but with another front  
i'm just a secretary  
yes  
right okay  
yes mm-hmm  
i hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having i mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes  
well that's an idea of course yeah  
'kay  
i think that too less people would change it for good profit  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
so that's a four at most  
like <unk> some <unk> older telephones use a <unk> uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible  
you need to put it on and turn  
mm yeah  
but you have to be able to tune it that once  
we can leave the p. c. on i think yeah and return to the  
or is is easy to map between finer grained distinctions and coarser ones  
and it's also possible to give a more precise direction quite quickly  
but you can't displace people who are in there reading just because you want to have a mini meeting or whatever  
yeah  
the one button we have  
yeah  
right  
frame <unk> problem  
and <unk>  
he was aiming for he's not really kind of doing speech coding but he want to do it on music  
yeah  
well i was hoping for some feedback from yeah  
the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want  
a three  
oh okay  
do you want to open  
it's treasure  
i'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh  
menu  
okay cool  
um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls  
say uh change the lighting in the room  
ah um i think it's finish  
uh yeah  
i know it could have been amazing  
and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of  
yeah well that that's the way it works  
and that's really easy to use bright so i like this one lot for our design  
but it's for a remote control i think it i it would satisfy those needs  
yeah i'd i'd um yeah  
okay  
but uh  
okay  
yeah i <unk> i don't know many people without a t. v.  
i don't know  
or okay  
has multiples yeah  
<unk>  
we should discuss that  
uh well no i was wrong  
because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here  
uh it will be one camera pointing very general but just for display purposes essentially  
of the of the device  
and it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the led  
if it if we want a <unk> universal remote control that we <unk> like we say before it may  
so it's important that we <unk> um do this second pass  
one more criteria  
uh the other one is the <unk> office  
or i dunno if you could have a battery pack  
okay  
if you  
okay  
um so yeah  
round  
welcome to the conceptual design meeting  
if you get line i get soft component  
feature and that isn't  
no this is something that it started off sort of as a discussion at the coffee table  
they may not have it in one place  
true  
this will help them find the one  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
or browse  
right  
uh because uh there there is just um four microphones that are eight  
mm-hmm  
the <unk> th th the signals the  
um do you have a marketing presentation for us  
yeah we are using it but it's not it's not poorly used but it's not efficiently used i think  
sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick i think like i <unk> if i was in the habit of buying remote controls then i would want one  
mm-hmm  
simple shapes uh <unk> material  
mm-hmm  
yes  
is these are these the colours that of production or is this just what we had available  
uh  
where was that example of the  
okay so what's the bottleneck  
so uh uh having an l. c. d. <unk> display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons  
can we do it <unk> within two two euro  
mm-hmm  
is that the wood uh wood uh this we have to have that one too  
okay and and that's the  
which one of those are we gonna use  
yeah yeah a very or a quick uh slides  
mm 'kay  
and it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that  
but al for your case you don't need really complicated posterior you just need some p. l. p. <unk> and then  
yeah  
well we are designers so we have to have a a more uh a <unk>  
yeah  
right okay  
yeah  
yeah uh  
yep  
uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just <unk> itself if it's <unk> by you know magnetic waves or whatever if if it  
um so i guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time  
and we shouldn't allow emission  
for like few months  
yeah  
oh  
yeah  
yep  
it's good  
you know often you don't know what <unk> what channel it's on or you don't know what's on  
so um  
but we gonna  
'kay  
if it's flat then like <unk> like on a cellphone or a mobile phone  
yeah why not  
we should plug it in  
uh-huh  
are we gonna do that  
charger we don't have charger here either  
okay  
um rubber that is used in these anti stress balls  
it's very um bland looking it's just text on the screen not even yeah just black with just text  
mm-hmm  
there we go  
my turn  
so  
that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this  
colours  
in fact i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires that we don't do that um  
i can do this movement and for righty as well  
yeah  
more two  
so the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros  
okay  
a teletext and a menu and then then i that's it  
um  
um so like big <unk> um buttons for people you are visually impaired  
so maybe if you well i could see the other email that they sent you  
uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial  
right so um i will talk about the the <unk> working design and  
based on what nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um i think  
is yeah i kind of nicked the idea  
i don't know how it works  
yes <unk>  
oh oh <unk> okay oh 'kay  
so there is something for just for putting them together in a relatively simple way but still a way that we can sort of justify  
hmm  
yeah it's really  
yes  
oh yeah  
okay  
and you give higher coefficient to the middle than to the extreme  
<unk>  
but it could be any colour  
couple time  
um  
this is what i'm sort of  
i don't know  
yeah  
um that one is oh no it's delicate  
yeah  
alright how do i uh skip pages  
um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control  
yeah  
i dunno if it depending on the final shape of it 'cause you could have like  
close <unk> uh do you know where clare de <unk> coffee shop is and  
but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control  
i tried to save this the last time at twelve point three and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere  
mm  
<unk> what does i. d. v. i. d. n. m. e. stand for  
okay  
but you're the project manager you can make the hard decisions  
okay  
okay  
i think it's a mouse or a rat  
no it's no chip  
well it's a different application of it  
okay  
and you always lose them  
yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah and the colours as well  
it's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button  
yeah but maybe there are already some machines you know uh uh  
it's also designed for people above forty  
so we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily  
yeah yeah  
i guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor  
thanks guys  
you where it's yeah walking to yeah  
it is unbreakable and it is very universal  
good idea  
if it could be <unk> indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery  
for t. v. you're always in in the <unk> of a t. v. so i don't think think  
but is it  
chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and i would certainly recommend it i think because i'm not sure i have an alternative  
okay  
yep  
but you know sound room which we specially built for this  
and we also need to determine the specific functions of this just to get it all out on paper  
uh latex you can't do solar power with a latex one  
yeah  
yeah  
mm careful because the uh i listened to frank and apparently don't want to buy a new machine before we show that this works  
it's just the order that we got  
yes  
yeah  
yeah  
save as  
uh overall we are getting two something but we can round it as two  
yeah  
okay  
uh-huh  
yeah  
oh is he  
yeah  
because we want to be quick on on the market  
alright we're finished  
uh two  
the fruit  
uh-huh  
right  
uh yeah  
but uh yeah  
uh then you go to a a next level you can push two buttons  
i dunno what do you guys think  
to go to the next one  
but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting  
um  
mm  
i if <unk> mister geometry  
well  
if you don't transmit them then the signal is quite robotic or something like that  
but  
our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design  
yep  
definitely not no  
so you are saying that you're doing something i in india with uh  
yeah uh i would go for the six too  
synergy  
channels that way instead of  
first the findings  
it'll be per machine i would think  
oh  
like i first knew oh there's a lot of time between the presentation and the report  
so there you might want to use a  
well you can adopt it you can well i can't remember you know okay but he has uh he has a <unk> yeah right  
okay  
but  
yep  
maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options so user can select which colour they prefer so  
or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener  
um  
four  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
'cause i've seen i've seen this used on computers before where you just you address the remote you address the computer and then give it a command  
i'm not certain about that but i  
yeah  
like a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than like  
um are the are the costs under twelve fifty euro  
yeah  
so that's okay yep  
so  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
'cause it's not talking about a specific line  
okay  
yeah that's your choice  
would that be  
yeah we got it down to not too many  
have di  
and the mute  
yep  
yeah  
right  
it was <unk> yeah just the <unk>  
um all the settings about audio settings video settings and channel settings which are not very often used  
the second one b.  
yeah  
i think it would take extensive marketing okay an apple with a red button on top even i am <unk>  
mm  
i think it's pretty much the same sort of connection  
what you've been working on for the last  
i think so too  
yes  
'kay  
yeah  
like a <unk> soft material  
channel changing  
damped lyman also is not systems yeah  
well now i see four  
but of course when you have cuts you can see they are easy to detect right i mean like something yeah  
mm-hmm  
and presumably that's red there  
i see  
are we uh ready  
okay well i don't know any perl  
or two buttons  
and uh repetitive strain injury i suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it  
uh it <unk> it doesn't  
so you can find out whether they have it  
mm-hmm  
yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them  
yeah mm-hmm  
the television tells me what channel it's on when i change it  
it's only when we start looking at sort of the total gaze that um the total amount of time spent looking at one particular object  
we're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock  
so for mm yeah  
okay  
yeah  
i don't think it's easy to use or not so  
so they shouldn't have any trouble accessing it once they've got the log ins  
in the project uh  
teletext has become outdated due to the <unk> popularity of the internet  
in that case you want to browse faster browse slow you want to have those kind of <unk>  
uh six i would say yeah  
huh  
true  
um sorry as long as were you  
okay  
so the the file with annotations for information density what would that be like  
c. d. m. a.  
the way they're looking mm-hmm  
yes  
uh that's all about uh the buttons  
is it a system  
the channels change one by one  
um so there you go  
oh sure but i mean the scripts are so automated it's just a matter of sitting uh uh submitting a job to the cluster and  
yeah  
i can see why it looks appealing but it could be a weak point in um the structure do you think  
mm-hmm  
and designing looking at the chips the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for  
that's the idea so  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
and i'll have a look if well i think we should show them before your presentations because it's not really uh  
yeah  
huh  
you just do that on line 'cause that won't take long to build a little dictionary that big will it  
yeah  
okay  
but uh  
let's see here  
fine  
mouse is <unk> just isn't working if you're sketching  
right  
if we got already uh something like a base  
<unk>  
that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side  
and if not how do we make that happen  
the third meeting  
how much  
you can  
no if <unk> if you look at new phillips uh d. v. d. with their uh remotes <unk> players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped  
we want it to be <unk> multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart  
four  
mm  
that's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products  
do we go basic or do we go for features  
and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah i've seen that before actually  
in directory yeah  
more profit  
yeah definitely  
oh  
i mean this is not the first attempt to do things like this and it never works actually i in terms of recognition  
'kay  
yeah  
especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group so  
yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve  
uh and uh in the survey from uh milan and paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the <unk> the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features  
mm-hmm yeah sure  
you are doing th  
uh yeah  
no no  
so by the sounds of it with what we're suggesting so far  
uh i've no idea about it  
um  
there was that  
per  
yeah  
okay yeah okay okay seconds plus number  
or one  
the i go everywhere power and the high definition d. v. d. players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these  
<unk> average of six speakers and they're measured every o. point o. one six seconds  
or yeah uh th th the i mean <unk> this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do  
uh-huh  
um so you can be on the object but not on the other person's gaze  
and that the menu button is okay  
uh now in spite of that i know some people use much longer windows which is not a problem  
so how <unk>  
yeah  
<unk>  
okay  
hmm  
oh  
nobody can beat <unk> petr uh petr <unk> anymore in i mean if even if if nokia knows everything if you if you sell it tomorrow who did you work for th the uh uh text no  
yeah  
third on the list and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect it has to be easy to use  
just a just a phone wireless  
is that  
radio <unk> are <unk> type  
you're looking at the t. v. and and it's uh it just seems kind of like a a needless th  
a star burst is a class  
we need it for ami  
probably the mm one way that they extend the <unk> the hard disk to the people who are experts  
okay  
could be shaped like a conch you know  
and and do we have to have a normal black one or uh  
do you have a lot of new information  
mm  
<unk> yeah  
i was thinking <unk>  
that's it really  
and then you give them some pages and say which one would you which piece of paper would you put that with  
anyways the the personal coach will give you the your <unk> your personal assignments and everything  
no no no  
yeah did we implement uh the sound  
um and then thirdly  
and so if they're left lying close together okay or in the in fact in the model in the not in the model  
are like that  
one wheel  
so that's a lot  
i'll have a look  
okay  
you know  
oh yeah  
and i would like to to know uh whether it is in the same category as the first one  
mm it's a nowadays very uh known a known uh uh technology  
sixteen euros  
mm-hmm  
it's it's just my own map so i put everything into the  
yeah  
yeah so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted but jog dial  
alright  
some sort of proximity  
it's tuesday  
but  
wicked isn't it  
but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false going over these different criteria  
well i reckon that it  
then we can make add two colours on it  
<unk> um no i mean this is a very old one so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make  
yeah  
'kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas  
right  
uh functionality uh like people's opinions on functionality the relevance to the remote and how often they're used  
and that it  
because <unk>  
yeah they would um you would make the the product as you normally would  
mm-hmm  
as usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company  
alright  
right  
and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at <unk> and that seems to be the most uh cost effective way of producing it  
i think i thought the like you said like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy  
<unk> i don't know where  
yeah oh sorry i i thought we were talking about having two files  
mm  
mm yeah  
yeah yeah i've i've not been using that  
okay  
<unk> function of  
thanks  
okay  
no no  
i just put the minutes here and we'll see  
yep  
i would <unk> give the word to um g. and g. for the prototype presentation  
but how to integrate the information  
oh i highlighted all as one right  
uh it ha it had the <unk> the most uh slides  
up there we go  
i think the price is okay  
it's enough  
mm-hmm  
ah i see  
so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh you know you want to manage with it  
i suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately  
one  
okay okay  
and if it's easy to use that's a bonus  
more like a joystick then  
so my uh presentation is about trend watching  
um other functions  
mm  
yeah when you press the red button you go to page one hundred two and when you press the  
yeah yeah  
right  
any ideas of of maybe <unk> let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have  
okay  
it uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read  
probably i would say probably not worth the investment at this point in time  
or you could use use this one but i don't know if it's very comfortable to use this one for the wheel  
uh  
so th the total of the thing is very bright  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed for now  
where you're yeah uh were you're holding it kind of  
yeah  
but <unk> i'm little confused about it  
okay  
um it is quite it's quite sensible to any <unk> what i found  
so we still have three and a half euro to lose  
i doubt that at daimler they are trying right now but maybe other companies mm  
how do you guys feel  
um  
mm-hmm  
nah  
dunno  
a kind of thing that  
yeah mm  
because you would avoid making doing extra work because you were doing extra work now uh <unk> working on the on the speech recognition  
<unk> you you  
there's no need to have buttons on it to do that maybe to do  
um so yeah um i was thinking something easy to use especially for older people  
yeah  
okay  
mm  
oh we can  
i've i've sort of i've written it for for <unk> just in half an hour or something similar  
huh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah one yeah  
okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion  
yeah  
so that's a measure of jiggle in the region roughly  
yeah  
so users have different i mean they have their own interests colour interests and so  
okay i <unk> i think so too  
blame our accountants  
um looking at the needs people specified the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating <unk>  
i don't think l. c. d. is not necessary well th for long term  
so draw us your favourite animal  
or say the regular one or the more advanced then that would have to be the same for all of them  
right  
yeah  
should be in my in their folder no  
but if you  
and then you can put a red cover on it  
ease of use  
yeah  
it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually  
and so  
oh right okay  
yeah yeah  
okay  
um but it would be held in such a fashion where it is obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic  
maybe if you get that working then you should be able to directly go into another machine  
should it be  
well absolutely but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company  
saying that sort of we bring in information density  
maybe for which market segments should we aim or should we aim for all segments  
for the series  
mm-hmm  
i think so  
because usually when you do f. f. t. <unk> if i'm getting into details but you you apply um a window to avoid effect  
uh maybe more devices you can influence  
yeah would it be flat on both the sides would be curved from one side or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available  
taking out teletext okay  
you can't parallel also that's the problem  
yeah  
yeah  
yes but without the clock you don't have well actually you're right it doesn't like <unk> it doesn't strictly have to do any movement in it yeah  
yeah  
so we can move to the next slide  
all th all those <unk> yeah  
our sale our sale anyway  
pineapple  
mm  
uh it's it's more about the protecting the l. c. d. which i think is where it came from  
the logo  
shit  
<unk> <unk> <unk> just <unk> just 'cause we haven't uh we haven't <unk> haven't quite <unk> the um the g. d. f. format  
yeah  
and maybe they are on the cache of this browser this computer  
i mean they really they made it clear that they were that that was gonna be heavily  
yeah but just don't trust too much the trends  
yeah  
oh okay  
uh for uh ultimate <unk> uh <unk> uh use of uh solar panels you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels  
and so but the i am to all saying yeah  
<unk> we ha no no no but th that's not <unk> um  
yeah martin is fifty per cent  
um  
so <unk> <unk> a single contribution by a single speaker you can within that you can use r. s. t. if you want to right  
i think especially for uh the older generation  
and the next one uh yeah when it's lost uh you can find it  
and is is it external to this card  
um  
different as well  
they were ugly  
<unk> yeah  
so perhaps one that was more um  
i believe i should be taking minutes on this right now  
we can have push buttons like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push buttons  
um three out of four people claim <unk> uh to find remote controls ugly  
and each can it can respond for your voice like it can turn on the light for you just to <unk> find it easily yeah  
uh wanna gain market share  
it th this is whole concept  
but the important thing is you don't treat that entire set as mutually exclusive and exhaustive  
and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well of the glow in the dark material just as <unk>  
okay  
like so sort of like how do you i i mean one one way of looking at it would be  
or fits the meeting browser  
yeah  
yeah  
well i had just a little bit of time so i hope it's something uh we can work with  
um and it'll just be i'm not even sure that's you 'cause i think somebody else is doing that actually  
i think you can just count them by a um let's move over  
hmm  
and you've got they're sort of they're looking  
something that hasn't been done before we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design  
yeah i just make a new one  
oh right okay i'd that that's something i maybe should have covered  
okay  
uh so um that she's an italic she will arrive in about two month  
it's a line  
hmm  
the other thing could be that um you could take away the l. c. d. panel and the advanced chip together um because when you  
yeah  
so stupid manager  
awesome  
i think it's cool  
gonna zoom in real quick  
i don't really know what that means  
true  
it's it's it's really <unk> it it's a very simple thing but it it basically just  
oh alright 'kay  
because  
ah okay  
yeah  
yep  
that's great  
uh  
yeah  
perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts like with the telephones  
<unk> oh no  
uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way  
to be a bit late with the title might not be bad because it will help them to  
uh yeah i don't yeah we cannot see  
if there's no value i guess you have to put a zero in  
it was like fifty millisecond or something what they were playing with at the time  
so you hope found out how to do it with a word document  
it's it's quite innovative yes  
mm  
well i guess uh i think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course  
yeah but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience you <unk> don't gonna <unk> uh write uh small  
but you know they're not meant to replace any that are all that are that haven't been thrown away  
fruit smelling spongy titanium  
yeah  
it's a colour  
well  
it's not a cat it's a dog  
okay  
but but if you compare with these ones uh i think they scored a one or two  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
we're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is  
uh one <unk> is about this um sector based stuff like uh the <unk> and detection  
okay  
so we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay  
okay um i'll do some  
so i try my best until january  
i plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half  
really  
right  
then we use these phone <unk> as features or as scores for for either just decoding or <unk> uh uh <unk> <unk> training and inference training and then decoding  
that was exactly my point  
okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah  
um words in <unk> uh  
'cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones  
um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button which i guess is just the same as the standard ones  
and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front  
yes  
so  
'kay  
it's it's a nice idea but i think that's we <unk> later in the stage  
yeah  
and so we've got point three to get rid of  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
i <unk>  
okay so congratulation  
i mean i'm not gonna have views on this anyway  
yeah  
then move it with the help of this okay  
four <unk> it's like  
yeah  
why don't i have a screen here now actually that's new but that's okay  
you can  
maybe if it's more if there is a software inside that ask you three  
since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost  
and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something  
maybe at least they will give some number others like they can  
it wouldn't be very fancy  
no but you <unk> yeah  
yeah yeah  
um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal but uh  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> first point the first thing you told me that you took the slides and you was and you had a <unk> big dictionary and you are seeing uh what what are the inside the slide  
no uh i  
and something we forgot maybe uh about the speech recognition system are we going to use it or not  
um  
that's fine  
yeah  
once they are finished  
mm-hmm  
no signal  
that's it  
and it can also do the action  
i can't believe a whole day is gone  
okay  
appropriate okay  
right  
the which probably has a <unk> maybe finer <unk> uh which i believe has finer grained distinctions than and different labels than the penn tree bank  
a large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls  
thank you  
yeah  
yeah  
we we are all in the same condition  
yeah i think i think for um i mean most people are right handed so in in terms of our greatest target group  
okay so that's like an okay button right  
yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the  
i mean was kind of  
yeah that's what i see also  
yeah i thought it was a demo basically  
alright  
mm-hmm  
right  
yeah they have to be on it <unk> just to <unk> to get it done if necessary  
sure  
so but  
and that um uh uh they they have this front end which uh uh which which can do a <unk>  
i think it is  
yeah so it's maybe a bit unnatural also  
mm yeah  
oh yeah  
that was that  
yeah 'cause yeah they did some work <unk> project with the h. p. s. g. parsing  
um i'll just check we've nothing else  
<unk> just a thought  
uh okay so good news from me uh uh for me from hamed but bad news from bob obviously  
good afternoon  
hey hey  
um it goes to a different selection of buttons so it <unk> keeps it simple  
mm  
and um of course these two cards will be on the same machine  
uh once we've chosen a a concept for it we can then design the features around the concept  
you can move back and forth and then if you need to <unk> choose something on the screen you just push the <unk> mm the middle button  
this is a <unk> like a real task  
and then uh we'll uh <unk> don't watch the number yet  
well uh let's say <unk> uh you uh  
but nothing too fancy  
yeah that's a scroll  
so okay  
oh gosh i've no idea  
like like family use as well so for little kids and for old <unk> like teenagers will like it i think  
so it's even  
the morse code goes to the amplifier then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs  
mm  
yeah the  
yeah i don't know  
different colours yeah  
so there you go yeah  
no  
i'm next okay  
yeah  
right so  
yeah definitely  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yes i <unk> <unk> i understand what you mean yes  
i think proportion like i even though i'm i'm always getting myself confused about this but i think sort of making the summary length thing generally proportion  
you name it  
we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable  
okay but then we don't offer a re <unk> function  
yeah  
or or that we have to have some sort of special colour  
yes and i want to yeah  
yeah but the mouse is also a dynamic object  
do we do we know uh by how much  
i think a two  
let's say that uh in any case uh <unk> well there are two reason  
yeah <unk> bit smaller and <unk> well uh and and i think more at the bottom  
yeah yeah  
this basically sends information to a <unk> uh transistor here which then uh sends the information to an l. e. d. device here  
we just come to an agreement  
okay <unk> technological aspect  
we've just got ten eleven twelve th we got fourteen that we need  
okay think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium  
then we must just uh just annotate a small part of the meetings and using some learning techniques to boot boot strap the uh uh automatic uh <unk>  
lot of options  
yep  
and  
menu button access the menu in the l. c. d. screen  
i don't think  
i like user <unk>  
would give us a light here  
anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know i i it will work most of the time um  
oh my god  
price of materials  
but if we go away with that that kind of general  
so of course there there might be uh some uh disturb uh disturbed uh when you concatenate those segments together  
or maybe you want to phone him  
it should be uh uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
right  
um let's move to next slide  
okay  
yeah  
no  
'kay  
some some <unk> uh information and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information  
okay  
and we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design  
so not the favourite animal but i think i'll draw elephant  
i think the teamwork was good as well  
oh we have time  
but it's the technical side of the remote control  
select none  
mm-hmm  
how do you mean  
yep  
mm  
yeah maybe it's better  
mm-hmm  
well let's look at your uh design  
no for now  
well on the utterance level i was thinking  
um mm permanently  
the blue range the green range the  
exactly  
is everyone happy with that  
i can't think of a better example at the minute  
uh <unk>  
cool um  
so and  
it's  
we can put it on the on the back side  
that's quite easy  
this is our last meeting  
it'll get rid of the message  
um  
he is a big guy  
okay okay  
yeah  
yeah i think this uh this is a good size for the screen  
i mean those nine plus one or two  
yeah  
no but you would slide it into uh <unk> like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons but  
so where are you represent the phase  
great  
but what else are we gonna put i mean not that i'm really gung ho about it  
yes  
alright  
mm-hmm  
let's see what that would do  
yeah  
well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off  
that's not a very exciting colour  
the one thing about that and this is something that came up in the last nist <unk> was the fact that it's almost too uni modal  
so oh  
or not  
sign off  
but the day you want to do uh on line real time stuff nah i wouldn't wouldn't trust it  
t. v.  
yeah  
especially the important buttons um if you want to switch channel change your volume uh use teletext  
yeah so i've <unk> channel program is <unk>  
say say one and two  
mm  
or or or leading on from this given what you've learnt  
but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black  
just ask  
what about the settings of the t. v.  
mm  
no  
mm  
green  
so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control  
oh no the plus  
is the is the data always clearly split up by different series  
yeah but well that's all fine  
and how much more expensive is that  
you're the p. m.  
um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons  
so the advanced functions are still hidden from you but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use  
angles to it  
yes but they're they're mass production  
i've it's uh i it i should have at least four  
so if you don't want  
uh-huh  
yeah  
alright  
well at the moment we could  
right  
yeah  
yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything  
um  
and uh my personal preferences  
thank you  
but what about um the markets  
it's just a <unk> it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table  
paint  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah all all the all events have a start time and an end time  
faster laptop  
alright  
sorry  
yeah  
i got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user friendly  
everybody everybody ready  
but the the question is <unk> does those <unk> increase the production cost or decrease the production cost  
that's perfect so i guess that makes sense for you to take it from here  
um and again the proximity to the other offices  
uh  
kate  
um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere  
or or you leave very quickly  
because otherwise in the in the other things there is no information about what the participant name is and so on  
'kay  
i guess keep it probably yeah  
we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break  
maybe a new sort of thing but <unk> but not teletext  
simplicity and fashion and yeah or <unk> <unk> however you wanna say that  
so i'll rub off the other two  
yeah i'm happy enough with that  
so when you have a bullet list can i click on one of the bullet and get the piece of speech where the guy was talking about that  
but they want to talk into the remo remote control or something or  
thank you  
i think  
well i'll figure that out in the meantime  
yeah  
oh you're doing that  
how nice  
yeah  
so um i think maybe uh two batteries i dunno what they're called six or something like that  
yeah  
yeah  
okay and that's in that's with the fully <unk> sort of compression scheme or that's just the raw data or  
no i don't think because this is a zero  
mm  
it is now you're in charge so there you go  
see if the pens work  
mm  
sure  
yeah  
so you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces  
yeah but it seems like a bit silly to be parsing it over and over again kinda thing  
and then with the same  
i mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy  
come on  
just checking  
okay  
<unk>  
he's starting with uh so the <unk> left window is starts at twenty milliseconds  
so it's it's quite <unk> complicated to get uh to get used to  
but but we are at the upper end of the push button market  
yeah  
hmm  
right okay we'll that's that's the end of the meeting then  
mm-hmm  
so it should be very user friendly you know  
the only way of  
um dave if you would or actually for well if you're doing i. d. f. <unk> or you whatever you call your your frequencies i always mix up the name  
yeah  
change colour i mean that's very  
and uh <unk> everyone will say i'll buy it  
a finding kind of device or yeah ho homing device  
just put it on the side and it's very easy to use  
yeah  
so that's not something that colin should just do in his own  
um  
i <unk> yeah  
could you plug me in  
i mean in some way you know they're all relational  
this  
yeah  
yeah  
what's  
oh there it is  
or not at all  
okay  
um  
or various aspects of this because uh he's eager to  
yeah i yeah i mean uh everything is pretty much artificial  
yeah <unk> yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
lost my mouse  
you just uh ask uh it to find a distribution over aspects such that a document uh is more likely according to the restriction that the number <unk> aspect is limited  
uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that i forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful  
because that's sort of the whole thing about having a prototype system which is more or less working on on chunk data  
yeah  
yeah  
very much yeah  
it isn't hard no  
i wonder if they mean like literally make it sort of buttons and everything  
pressed about five times now  
um the board we have to use basically uh the same set up  
shouldn't we first discuss about like what <unk> we all  
um mm  
no okay so so it's fancy  
thanks a lot  
and we'll just sort of do a run through of proper pilot just to just just so i can see th  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
so uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's i think it's that's my opinion  
and you  
i <unk> um well it's it's not a technology <unk> yeah  
so you know as we said we got the outer casing which we have to decide you know what's it gonna be  
this uh isn't nothing  
by by what  
so they rejected something or they broke something <unk>  
'cause you can't afford that <unk> we took that out too  
no  
um  
okay yeah  
it seems to be falling over  
and the uh the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know they take more budgeting  
if that's too expensive we won't do that  
okay  
yep  
bugs bunny one  
oh  
v. l. b. a. is an instrument  
oh is he back  
mm yeah that's good that's good  
he's smiling  
nope  
then  
our one does the complete opposite you know so that's something that's new  
morning  
okay  
uh right  
<unk> don't with damped lyman alpha observers you them a variety of places along the line of sight  
oh  
okay so uh personally i think we should infra use infrared because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every t. v. set  
uh point at a t. v. i think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the t. v.  
mm-hmm  
okay um well um these scroll wheels i think uh they they can be they can be handy  
okay um the case was is made from rubber i suppose  
yeah  
which is which is good and it's interesting point  
that's it  
okay  
then you go away  
but i think uh this is two different problems  
dark blue or  
course  
i <unk> i  
'cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh  
but you don't you don't have to move the the charger  
that's oh yeah since we only have one button  
mm  
oh okay  
yeah  
yeah  
so we just call them the swedish and the finnish  
like three mental states yeah you know what i mean we can just make it uh  
oh well what's new  
i mean it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it but um i think the bay is definitely uh  
yeah  
because now it's just an average it's remote  
didn't we  
okay but i'll i'll go into that because there are are some possibilities and some <unk>  
mm  
mm  
uh so yeah uh just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face  
i i talk about that yeah  
and we uh decided on  
ho ho  
yeah  
i think he need a control that is very reliable so  
um and all their positioning in the circuit  
the idea of a paging function a touch screen and face plates  
yes  
marketing  
it doesn't do anything nasty  
so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project the information we got on the news  
oh <unk>  
yeah 'kay basically um  
yeah  
well i i suppose that things become design  
but uh it seems to be out of trend you know nobody seems to be  
they are they are approaching or in they are in zero  
uh  
yeah  
play doh  
i mean to come here and to and to help us with the installation on a computer and uh and uh to to to get the so i have more the feeling that this is something that could be done almost in one month  
how is it i mean it can look really great and still have the same up <unk> down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote  
yeah but no  
but it doesn't which more subjective i think this whole  
huh  
your vote and your okay  
um  
some of the good stuff we got  
mm  
mm  
that's what you wanna do  
yes  
control panel  
right  
<unk> i mean we we can uh uh <unk> but i mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last  
uh so <unk> at <unk> alright yeah  
um  
but pitch isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone  
we're gonna build we're gonna use javascript to build the videos on the fly right 'cause it's fast  
uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing  
we said we're not gonna go oh but now i expected it in more detail and oh  
we don't wanna outsmart  
so you can see there that the if you want to keep kinetic right  
mm-hmm  
um the thing i like about this is that  
this person probably need to use this feature like once you know when you first buy the remote control  
mm-hmm  
uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip <unk> if we're gonna start using an l. c. d.  
yeah  
is  
i have one  
mm  
yes  
um i'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction how does it work  
so this shift will suppose if you find one segment of sixty milliseconds and then you're doing this ten millisecond so every almost i think yeah  
so we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip  
but i think uh we gotta build a <unk> pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits  
hmm  
okay  
ah  
standard deliver  
yeah  
it can also be interesting to have this kind of  
oh yeah  
how much time do we have to draw anyway  
no so they they can have different uh nuts there  
okay  
yeah ho yeah  
but even like you can put mm <unk> in administrate office like  
requirements no  
yeah at least i mean <unk> those studies i think people already did for even in i. c. i. c. s. l. p. two thousand two there is special session on features for aurora  
mm that's your uh division  
oh i cannot say it  
it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that  
yeah  
and full network what was the <unk> <unk> architecture  
you can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons  
i've been to durham uh post graduate conference and i mean every conference i've ever been to  
inverse yeah  
so we still  
and they would basically be because even the selection would would the summaries automatically feed from just how prioritized an individual word or how <unk> uh prioritized an individual utterance is  
yeah  
more chic  
yeah  
uh all the different pieces but they say oh this piece i leave out because it's below the current threshold level  
yeah  
so yeah we put this stuff on so that so that we have some record of the whole thing what uh are going to say  
mm  
you could give give craig more work to do  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so um what they like and what they find fashionable  
poor elephant  
yeah  
this one  
yeah i think we <unk> we shouldn't  
yeah it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh  
i  
hmm  
i'd say it's i wouldn't not if you're left handed it's not  
can't believe i've forgotten it  
i think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible  
okay  
yeah  
especially when you have a lot of channels  
yeah  
and uh as i can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
what do you mean by the circular section  
so you do he'd he'd <unk> a ne a new zip file and overwritten the old one  
we're a bit behind  
that should be alright  
method yeah  
ah okay so focusing more on the used buttons  
oh number  
yeah  
and the r. r.  
yeah  
so  
mm mm  
like it really is like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for they don't really care whether you know  
i think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group  
i think you can put anywhere you want actually  
well good  
uh you should explain  
yeah  
um susan wanted a private office she has a preference for private offices  
gamma full model but uh what about other ones and what about the <unk> posterior because because i i uh you know  
'cause that's what relative term frequency is about that like in some context they're talking more about a certain word than in general  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
interface  
um  
so yeah it's fifteen point eight that's where we came up with it  
right  
so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t. f. t. screen  
i mean i mean i mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation  
the um it was basically what we said before the idea that you record in a set  
well i think the first thing is  
so just ask d. f. k. i. how much data and when right  
ah well maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money  
<unk> what  
if you're you're not skipping any bands or like oh <unk> fifteen into twenty then  
word that relates to other words  
no no no it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur but whatever  
mm-hmm  
right  
um yes  
yeah i think we have a a winning product  
okay  
<unk> if you wanna design it that way  
i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not  
i think this is possible  
yeah we turn it off  
oh right  
i mean it's not too uh  
hmm the c. d. player  
um  
because uh from <unk> hundred uh remote controls ninety nine have it  
it's a  
and what else did you say about fashions  
no sure  
well do we <unk> like i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for  
i'm not sure  
the output  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um i i'm not sure  
yeah  
uh  
yeah  
that like the highest level of merging it's not the whole <unk> corpus but individual series  
it's that bright selection  
a bit  
excellent  
uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip uh matthew so maybe we have to recap with this one  
um so i in my personal preferences um i'm hoping that we can <unk> keep the design as simple and clear as possible  
oh right yeah  
yes  
mm-hmm  
mm  
alright  
mm  
mm-hmm  
yeah just playing with it and especially when the <unk> rubber  
uh it's it's easier to <unk> just glance at this and see what's possible to do you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes  
but <unk> hmm  
yeah  
yeah i think two  
you only use those uh the first time or  
yeah  
yeah <unk> it it just takes a wee while  
i dunno if i should go with this  
well um then i'd like to make a proposal  
i don't know how much i like people without uh <unk> not taking it for credit because then they just sit there and having good time  
okay so now we are on the conceptual design meeting  
like beyond this <unk> <unk> beyond this current group of people do we do we know of any changes coming  
all the rest we <unk> we'll put it into this menu on the screen  
okay  
<unk> for game playing or interactive television  
yeah  
two  
yeah  
in <unk>  
no  
i am corinne whiting and i will be the marketing expert and in each of the three phases i will have a different role  
sorry  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you were there jean  
or like an you can get sort of outer casing for <unk> and something that's just it's protective as well  
i think it's good  
okay  
as you can see <unk> opening acquaintance tool training project plan discussion and closing  
um do according to our plans already given the market  
okay  
you could do do that  
yeah well yeah so i <unk> i <unk> do i did try it yeah th that's how you do that  
um  
okay  
and the speech recognition yeah  
anything else  
mm i didn't it i just looked at the <unk>  
so i don't think that's good  
yeah these one no no  
you have to use it very quickly  
then on your television there will appear a one and a a line which is an empty space  
uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things  
so  
especially after the first meeting  
the concurrent  
yeah  
uh <unk> getting close to the last is the <unk> meeting  
is that what you said  
but you guys felt that you could keep the yeah suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay  
that  
i think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big  
maybe  
when when the the <unk> has a has a bit what points out we can place all on top of it  
but are we talking about the button or about the microphone  
if we lose one we need to bring two or three  
and see what was okay or not for them  
sturdy you know  
um but they are used  
well it's good starting point right  
yeah  
right  
but i'm i'm still confused 'cause i thought like that's just what jonathan said we do <unk> that we can't do like load a massive document of that size  
that's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates  
yeah okay  
how sturdy is it gonna be  
yeah  
oh  
african or as an elephant  
yeah  
okay okay  
so  
okay  
intermediate  
at least a one yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
<unk> let's make first the the the all the views  
it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files  
so we'll just have to use it for everything  
yeah yeah  
yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in  
right  
uh uh and also other <unk> uh parts like uh the back channels without any uh semantic content uh from other participants  
we might have a while though  
mm  
yeah  
i think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like <unk> yourself and twist your remote control to get it the t. v. to actually pick up the signal  
right  
yes how would you innovate a remote control more  
yeah  
no no no no  
so  
that is good idea yeah  
hmm  
uh leadership next  
like grapes  
it was rubber and special colour right  
david jordan  
so the batteries uh are going to be very light  
i'll <unk> yeah <unk> i'll i'll i'll <unk> i'll be around  
um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock  
but you could make a teletext button uh six  
it's just that the connectors on the the connectors at the back of the computer can't  
right um i've been looking at some trends  
yeah initially yeah  
mm mm mm  
and uh as i said uh i uh have no idea how <unk> works  
blank  
relevance of that button our users found was uh ten ten out of ten  
is that manageable  
three  
uh it seems to me yeah something like that  
ah it's embedded your microphone  
yeah  
uh-huh  
uh  
i'd i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible but i agree it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is  
if i've read this thing correctly then we can save point five of a euro here in that it's not per push button  
yeah  
so i'd i had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually  
i am told  
and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division who have told me what's actually available  
<unk> just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is <unk> the trick  
is it useful  
mm  
maybe if it's no no but i think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants  
mm  
um this is the voice there is a voice recognition remote control which can control <unk> multiple devices  
um yeah i mean and it does it have voice i mean the phrase recognition on it  
more money for us  
it's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet so or something like that  
like um do you guys know <unk>  
okay  
yeah but this is what we would ask to the users so  
yeah  
is it <unk> technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu  
illuminate the buttons  
we could've used it more effectively probably  
on the  
yeah  
um i'm gonna give it a two  
okay  
alright  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
yeah yeah  
they can they're very adaptable they carry everything they need with them um and they're easy to draw  
mm  
and what's good with those model is that they they can they they are intended to provide you some some kind of way to compare two documents rather than to give you <unk> defined sets of documents  
yeah  
anything else  
hello  
like after this  
yeah  
mm <unk> <unk> <unk> we after this we can can consider uh for instance making this more attractive to to the demographic  
exactly  
um right this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um i'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you  
oh but we have curves like it and it  
old fashioned button to satisfy the grandmothers  
i think so yes  
yeah  
um  
so there's a good chance that almost none of the first years are gonna volunteer  
the look is a little bit more playful  
do you agree  
you were  
hmm  
seems to be  
yeah  
yeah on the th yeah maybe here  
so uh there is nothing so much new really like  
so presentation from  
mm  
um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours  
um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do  
et cetera  
i kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up <unk>  
yep  
that means uh there have to be fancy things in  
hmm  
i'm thinking fruits in my head but that's tacky  
that that doesn't <unk> that doesn't co  
it's a question of one month and so on <unk>  
um how to say this  
select something  
but i was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be you know  
yeah  
well we're doing ultra luminous galaxies  
'kay  
i think i just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well  
but of course if we can provide things we'll do it but uh yeah  
findings  
yeah that's the question  
okay with  
yeah  
might  
i have to use a new page  
okay  
if we need just frequencies maybe we should just calculate them by using perl or something  
any further comments  
the third one is um  
so if you run out of work go ahead and start checking because this is something that's um considerably um bottle necked at the moment  
yeah  
could we somehow we could may possibly sorry  
a one a one  
so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add  
nay but that this is what um  
yeah  
uh yes  
yeah <unk> it's not it's not a worry  
that's you're  
because we might need it to be curved for the uh  
just a thought  
that uh yeah  
i could create us another calendar  
do we um also present that in this window and do we do it across meetings  
okay  
oh we've been warned to finish the meeting now  
okay  
yeah  
kind of pull out of the side  
you can put it in there it's for your kids and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool  
well yeah yeah  
and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five  
but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production whether that would just increase the costs make it more complicated  
yeah mm-hmm  
uh at the side and the other side is the <unk>  
um well <unk> technological innovation we've covered that pretty much i guess  
mm  
yep  
they want it to be fancy th they they want it to be different  
yeah it just shows that there is a shot uh change at the end but even for dissolves  
yeah  
um  
okay  
because uh it ha th basically this opal modeling has a different properties  
like this is the first time that actually the but uh uh that should be okay that should be okay  
sixteen  
remember  
how how much will it cost  
but then we would have to drop the screen  
oh and what does it said  
i have  
okay  
whew  
if you hear just laughter on either side yeah do that  
this is wish <unk> uh functions  
yeah it's very you know if you're  
alright  
no for that one also  
and charging their remote yeah  
<unk> so we can try to go in between and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as  
oh not well  
so just cancel it  
yeah  
of course channel selection is used the most frequently  
well i dunno about like the flip phone idea because i think as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed  
so we <unk> must not just only look at what the trend is now as it might be totally different next year  
so about it but petr <unk> too  
you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right  
new  
uh  
dissolves is uh yeah  
um  
that was kind of what i found  
so based on the fact that most of the p. f. l. student have their own laptop uh the idea is the similar idea uh is to okay  
okay and gabriel  
so i uh this is only based on uh you give uh the spectrum and uh uh okay  
so uh only words um per meeting series  
oh do we have to tick our note thing again when we finish this  
nobody saw it honestly  
so uh those kind of things you can you can combine  
or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good  
yeah sure  
yeah  
maybe make it in the form of a gun  
uh that's maybe just me but uh we could uh  
uh we <unk> ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas  
okay  
okay  
that's nice  
this  
then it would probably be for us easy to just like off line put the the weight into into the file that has the segments  
um originally the like when we first like replied say yes if you're interested in doing this it said six weeks  
ne uh  
profitable  
i don't know how much we agree with that  
you worried about anything  
yeah  
okay  
arrows  
mm  
and apparently the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme  
ah okay  
uh  
and <unk>  
um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers  
uh at first we will uh i will <unk> uh say something about what younger people want  
right  
but that's well you would just have to to spin it down  
so now in in my life i will never believe anything which is temp  
one  
but um people kinda like generally sort of sort them out <unk> that sort that out themselves  
yeah  
okay  
which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy  
huge computer uh electronics store  
yeah  
yeah close it  
something which you when you press that it would beep to give its location away on the remote unit  
that thing is terrible  
well tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds  
the prototype discussion  
i uh i prefer um remote control working with radio waves  
all that happens is it refuses to load load the clock  
does it feel good  
and i heard that it worked very very well  
but it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven  
so that alpha could be different for every page  
do your own  
just a minute  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
let's move over to  
okay  
so you went to a beach  
okay do you want to have a look at the agreement and disagreement data that i worked on last week  
it's my cat  
but uh uh the the student should have knowledge about m. f. c. with oh okay  
<unk> but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular right  
okay  
a what  
you know you don't want to <unk> store all the hundred channel information into that  
no i think it's great  
for the recognition in general there is no correlation in the sense that even if you're talking about what is on the slide  
and it's just to it's just to playback something  
okay  
utterance to utterance yeah  
yeah  
it's a process but it also produces a <unk> feature where you can say there's the damped lyman alpha absorption  
you're talking about the user evaluation  
mm  
maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium  
like dust in it and so things like that  
street pizza  
so if we do this uh we're on uh twelve and a half euro  
but and the problem is i i'm we can infer i if you have <unk> voice control why not to put it directly on the the t. v.  
and of course we also have to make it look cool  
uh thank you  
like question is remote big enough we can say it's true or it's false by steps  
i'm not seeing where this is  
yes  
yeah  
or a device that was not <unk> not further specified that provides kinetic energy  
okay so two  
like on um like on a d. v. d. player  
this is the power button  
okay  
this is just something uh that uh this just to remove the d. v. recordings  
i'm just thinking you know like i so this takes the ascii to to a <unk> simplified ascii  
yeah that's <unk> that's a good idea  
but i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming  
okay  
or else uh they would have been <unk> another shape  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
but then you also have to <unk> have somewhere where you can put a remo <unk> near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you <unk> want to turn on the t. v.  
mm  
um <unk>  
in a marketing point of view  
so we can keep that in mind  
we already have some  
okay  
um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control  
and um well <unk> the for the most part for t. v. remote it's uh <unk> that would be channel control and volume  
well  
no no no no  
yeah it can go there yeah  
um target the design area of the interface  
i okay  
mm-hmm  
those buttons are are lit up  
ah probably not  
so that this button <unk> is for teletext which is usually also the case  
mm-hmm  
especially for transferring stuff  
yeah  
and there's a little picture just for your imagination how a device like this should look or can look  
mm-hmm  
this voice signal company <unk> hynek always mentions uh cohen's company with what they're using you <unk> yeah  
<unk> he says  
'kay  
because l. c. d. screens are very expensive  
i <unk> i really don't know  
there is also some um like uh not paper  
so this is the  
great  
exactly  
right  
yeah it's a it's a european project anyway  
yeah i really like that idea  
oh on the remote  
it looks more like a pineapple  
yeah  
but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches so  
not the original budget but they are now  
even if they then open their eyes somewhere else that's when they start absorbing the new information  
and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power and also volume and that sort of thing as as louisa said  
and this even uh makes it more <unk>  
hmm  
i think a. g. n.  
yeah see where the mouse is like this <unk> style thing where you <unk> have up down left and right  
remember that the weird <unk> thingy which looked like kind of a <unk>  
that makes it much more complex so we really need to have a look do we want that or not  
uh steven cox isn't it  
no no  
okay but uh i'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device  
yes yes  
yeah you're working separate  
yeah  
of but i think what is one false or is <unk> one true  
like the written language  
um then we'll take lunch  
it i think it does  
the scroll wheels a problem with them not being sort of  
it will <unk>  
yeah  
we've used it we're familiar with it but we're we can't <unk> we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to <unk>  
yeah yeah  
or <unk> actually sorry i think um the um this cut up page continues in the next side  
yeah okay  
with the <unk> yeah  
let's go  
'kay so you can yeah  
i mean that's the point  
it <unk> work  
okay but i will i will personally won't give it beyond three  
mm-hmm  
so i think we do need to stick everyone together uh particularly if they've got the same supervisor  
on university yeah  
well one colour for the case one colour for the buttons  
i don't know  
um so you're participant two  
we've used the <unk>  
because uh because there are there are several issues i would say  
that's true but lyman alpha forest clouds are source types we aren't marching marking  
but that's just half we should also consider look and then  
how are you gonna keep them separate  
so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing  
they want us to tell them  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we could make some little  
yeah okay  
no <unk> so  
kind of firm touch  
mm-hmm  
no  
how do you think about that  
so  
if we gave them the whole month that'd give us hardly any time  
okay  
it's helpful to the creative process  
yep  
yeah i'll have a look  
but um other than that i mean uh and that's um you know  
yeah  
this is like a residual for him  
yeah  
yeah  
list the wrong wrong colour for a few things  
okay and  
yeah  
it it it's non <unk>  
huh  
you don't  
we will we can make this for for twelve euro <unk> and fifty cents  
otherwise it would be the  
right  
yeah  
even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries you know  
yeah  
because uh if they have a six minute movie if they have thirty shots  
may i say something like that yeah a video slave machine uh which use the midi um which use also the midi time code  
mm  
it's shaking  
because they are already used to that you know product  
so we should at least provide an overview of different meetings of one group  
or blue or whatever  
yeah we have the we don't <unk> especially have the lightning but  
well you i <unk> i can uh still see your presentation  
features  
um  
they look like they did when i was in elementary school and that's so old fashioned to me  
yeah we need one integrated button for everything then  
mm  
control  
this is an instrument if you have it all isn't it  
yeah  
wouldn't that be absolutely massive though  
okay  
we don't want that  
you like <unk>  
even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood or <unk>  
<unk> we could  
ah  
i suppose it <unk> if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round  
for the advanced uh settings  
a snowman shape  
we've got the features  
um i've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy  
yeah it is  
this is a uh well a drawing board  
and the then we can al yes  
you can't really avoid that  
<unk>  
yeah  
okay  
but there's maybe some merit in altogether doing it on an utterance level in the end  
like we would have words with some priority levels  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your internet explorer  
on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh  
we would have uh <unk>  
yeah  
well it's it's been done years ago and i don't see it anywhere now  
product evaluation  
but no how little work we did  
elderly <unk> el elderly young people so  
no i want something else on mine  
it have it it has to move that's the the sense of it  
the hmm  
tone contrast and things  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
it may help us decide for now  
probably  
i i wanted to go but i wasn't allowed  
yeah  
um if you haven't done a <unk> thingy it doesn't matter it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium  
yeah  
yeah  
'kay  
and then yeah <unk> the k.  
pages  
um hubble and hubble deep sent to us  
the high powers from above will have to tell us yeah  
<unk> electronic  
<unk>  
mm  
so we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed  
um actually we're you know we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes so we have to get close to finishing  
oh ignore that  
mm-hmm  
call it something that's fruit and <unk>  
yeah it does look kind of dangerous  
well i if if this is if you are ready to do that then i think it deserves a one  
it it's more like integrated <unk>  
mm okay  
mm-hmm  
after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea  
lot of good ideas good facts to have  
yep  
i gonna put underneath so i've got some more space  
it would  
uh  
alright  
yeah  
yes that was mine  
we're ten percent of the way there  
yeah it would be quite good  
yeah presentation yeah  
yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars  
so that should uh right so seems to me that the thing that i have to do is  
yep  
but um for my segments were the um f. zero measurements and all those values i get from there  
yeah  
or um you know you <unk> uh you press uh say the play button for the d. v. d. player and it turns the t. v. on and onto the right channel as well  
and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation and so i will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did  
uh i know that the designers are gonna be working with play doh on that  
mm that's a <unk> feature that's okay  
four  
well  
no no i can't  
yeah but when you play with the ipod you don't have a big screen in front of you <unk>  
yeah yeah of course mm  
your fingers yeah  
it's out of the way as well i suppose so  
um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind  
uh  
repetitive strain injury  
mm-hmm  
yeah th yeah  
yeah  
okay hang on reply coming  
so that <unk> would be cutting cutting <unk> say about these buttons  
right  
i really appreciated those yeah  
if you don't want to use them you don't <unk> you <unk> just scroll over them  
but most most of the times if a if if a t. v. <unk> on standby people just press a channel to put it on  
okay  
i don't know though  
that's a scroll  
okay  
about the first meeting  
well uh you <unk> yes work on a design  
this one is a voice recognition  
why  
so but when when we talk about summaries you talk about this uh <unk> about skimming and not about  
well yeah well i guess that these were the only ones i guess  
that's sort of the combination of of the two scores  
i mean  
maybe even slight well oh yeah pretty much point two euros i'd say  
okay  
design  
hmm  
well i think the batteries should should <unk> should work a lot longer than a couple of days or not  
younger okay  
no  
and as we get into more the more um <unk> like sort of production side of things  
there we are  
i think that's a matter of what you're used to  
four  
then we celebrate in such a way that i have no idea  
'kay  
and you'll be evaluating the product  
hello  
okay  
i thought it was quite a handy uh thing although i would like to see um o. c. r.  
and with a normal mouse  
it was not a good idea  
um  
yeah  
alright so i thought a little bit about the interface  
what they say here is like suppose if you <unk> two distinct or uh this l. p. analysis in the same stationary analysis window  
well do we have um a <unk> an idea of how many people were gonna  
so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it  
this  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk> that way  
yeah mm i know but you start at twenty and go to sixty but where which point do you choose  
oh that one yes  
<unk> and we got the answer  
okay  
keys are probably the <unk> the number keys i suppose  
you could also drop <unk> three more of these without losing much functionality  
yeah  
um usually when you have a lot of buttons buttons are small  
okay  
you look quite funny at the moment tim  
remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult  
yeah  
they serve um right they <unk> <unk> <unk> they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in america and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty pounds about  
i think yeah the battery should be in here because it's just nothing so if you could  
that that's only the <unk> problem  
right  
because that way all we have to do to display <unk> more than one meeting is have a harder boundary drawn  
yes  
and i can't remember back when i used to live back in nigeria but i think i used to have a pet elephant  
one possibility is to put it back in the main conference and let people choose between a paper presentation and a poster  
but that could be because of the input data  
on one remote  
and to okay and back also  
<unk> a spare head  
well it's interesting  
doing an alignment from the slide stream and from the snap shots we would have on the other side <unk> is something that might be possible  
well you could you could choose whatever you wanted  
no  
mm  
and if we make it more innovative innovative then we lose points on it being fancy so  
is that a fair presentation of what happened  
yeah  
with the scroll wheel or no  
also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great  
yeah  
i give it a four now  
no that's good  
yeah right  
so i give you i give the real users mm the person um a bunch of marbles and they begin to say okay  
what i  
yeah  
mm  
okay so you <unk> you give oh yeah yeah i know i know  
that the line is stereo the input is mono  
technical requirements and something something yeah  
<unk> may be interesting for you  
they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them  
me too  
so i mean you can't make yellow titanium but you can make yellow rubber  
oh the okay button  
so  
yeah yeah  
'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something  
i  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay two  
okay  
yeah direction  
right okay so  
'kay so we have one two three four five six seven  
well  
okay well we'll see  
you should write <unk> the name i think  
but uh  
mm  
they are for some uh video uh  
could have things like <unk> the buttons and stuff like that  
um and we're having one per  
actually how  
yeah  
that's really all i got guys  
you want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use  
mm  
okay  
maybe yeah  
why not  
alright okay  
mm-hmm  
because you can't really see which way round it is  
yeah  
good point  
yeah so if we email out a script on how to like <unk> load it  
uh-huh  
but it's directly added when when these two in this situation when these two overlap right like this  
oh yeah  
mm  
i dunno how <unk>  
well just when you push a one one and  
yeah  
just so we can  
then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions  
and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question  
um  
are they  
yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions  
oh yeah  
no no we we <unk> we we just are use um  
um  
two  
um f. five and <unk> bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing  
yeah i think they're handy  
okay  
so maybe the  
yeah but how about those words which don't carry any meaning at all the um and <unk> and something like that  
yeah  
so then you'd start with all your utterances here and when you go up to get topic segments you go to here here here here here here here  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah but that's that's really quite easy to see because they're named  
and we were a able to modify each other's ideas  
mm-hmm okay  
so in this setup the whole link structure could be known  
and  
yeah maybe  
yeah  
yeah  
um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh  
right five  
so  
something like that least fits in your hand  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition  
you can't represent them on the same file  
yeah  
i think there will be time for that later  
so a selection of casings  
a channel  
mm  
um uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles where whereas the young and dynamic they like a more uh soft materials  
but if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple a. <unk>  
and if the discourse tells you what's going on that's information  
and i uh and i think that most of the users of the rem uh t. v. are belong to this age group  
but he didn't okay  
yep  
do yous not find that um  
piss off  
yeah  
apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers  
okay here we are again  
yeah  
oh yeah  
uh in this way so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys  
alright  
so it's it's worth also talking to her about that  
yeah  
so yeah  
yeah but you wouldn't have you you wouldn't do two <unk> for task level one you wouldn't do transaction coding in a action segmentation  
no  
uh then it's already visible in dark  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
if it was lines from h. two you'd mark it  
yep  
so what i was thinking oh wrong side  
yeah  
ah  
uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent  
you wouldn't say we're talking about yes  
yeah  
just for fast  
i think something that yeah  
okay so we lose the scroll wheel the <unk>  
well no it doesn't have to be  
yeah  
did did you resolve the the li the different um <unk> like uh the main problem was  
<unk> technical um specifications like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote  
okay  
these are both with uh with voice recognition but they're very advanced and very high tech and just um well a weird um  
seventy five pages  
mm-hmm  
mm  
contrast yeah  
oh yeah  
i would use the bird  
i just it's just hard to answer that without hearing something  
i don't recall a tomato  
mm-hmm  
um in in the resolution thingy um it will  
and then if you come yeah  
um <unk> use remote controls to a great extent  
i know it's really <unk> very intensive also like if you use  
yeah right  
okay  
different  
yeah this is uh still uh even even the non diploma work  
at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of <unk> or something  
yeah  
there's a line there as well  
yeah  
make something go away  
alright  
that's my favourite one  
huh  
i think i'm cool  
but it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying  
right okay  
because there are two <unk>  
but don't yeah  
you know a new computer keyboard or something that is quite explanatory  
'kay listen so why don't we meet after three then because then i can like until three make sure that i have all the display <unk>  
yeah we could make  
it's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah  
and uh  
uh it is still opening my programme  
so did you feel that it was some some kind of some process of convergence  
it was to to see if uh certain words have a tendency to appear during uh uh they if they are more likely to appear during certain slides  
i don't know what kind of information it would  
that's that  
but pitch is  
i will talk about different components and <unk> of system and how they react together  
well this is just a short intro  
next slide  
no battery use  
probably classical to totally geek it out yeah i think  
beep  
okay you're going to think about the working design  
ah right  
mm-hmm  
hello uh this meeting we are it's <unk> should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control  
<unk>  
the  
and um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one  
um and also the <unk> the the actual functions of what it's gonna do  
and the same  
f. five  
that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined  
it's now half past four half past three so  
yeah that makes sense 'cause it's a time domain sort of approach  
it's an easy bit of yeah  
and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand and you pick it up  
um  
um not quite  
it's uh inside its shell  
is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons <unk> i was thinking something some smooth  
ron was saying we need to think about uh <unk> the way it's looking um  
it's just an it's just an idea  
so that's that's why i called this  
okay i think this is more a question of of i i think this is more a question of of look and feel  
no no not demonstrate but like didn't you say that uh didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of it  
we're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price  
no <unk> say <unk> two  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
um x. ray b. l. x. and radio b. l. x. i think are because the b. l. within should be marked so  
we want people to eventually say oh that's that's real reaction that's a good <unk> make  
right aye  
if if if anybody wants to <unk> briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so  
okay  
it's just working on an arbitrary text file at the moment  
hmm  
i dunno we just need to decide on the on the case  
now we can make a new one  
you know maybe you went to um  
you're gonna run out of things to um <unk> do that we haven't set you up for any time soon  
but um i'm thinking more of the fact that um at some point we should probably tell you about this n. x. t. stuff  
can you do that  
never mind  
of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything  
mm  
oh it's not liking us it went that a way  
well this is not  
here we go  
and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible  
yeah  
all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together  
functions uh then they uh might 'cause young people uh like new features  
right  
simplicity meaning that we have few buttons  
you know what i mean  
they told you that they wanted <unk> our product to represent the the r. r. brand and and to be immediately noticeable  
there's an idea  
no that's very cheap  
so what i have <unk> found is that i think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because i think solar energy <unk> won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment  
yeah  
yeah i do  
and i think this may it it's good that this is a demo like this  
but that like that's the most professional way i can think about it  
yeah  
okay  
have a feeling that that can actually edit s. v. g. files  
and the mouse might be on triangle one  
the l. e. d. <unk> can be surprisingly bright now  
so we've had people in paris and milan watching the uh fashion trends  
okay yeah yeah  
or  
um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device uh i uh suggest uh the basic battery  
yeah  
yeah but they they don't want the uh extra options right  
and i wanted to see if the strategy was different when we could talk about it and when we just picked up whatever  
it is  
um i put all the minutes i make into the shared folder  
sure sure  
so we can have both  
i don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google  
i should have mentioned this um  
yeah  
i just went a bit mad didn't i  
that would be good  
uh the target audience product style  
yeah something that you can into it  
but that that's not innovative  
and hard materials like wood um titanium  
and your vote  
<unk> just a simple log in something like that  
that you have <unk> first you have to turn the remote on and then you can uh i don't know  
mm  
um we want something fancy and <unk> technologically innovative obviously  
we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands and fifty five of those people want l. c. d. screen and thirty five want speech recognition  
sure yeah  
so you can use it maximum because uh it's a lot it costs a lot  
mm-hmm  
um  
yeah but never seen one  
two  
so yeah i i'm it's in the first uh email so i'm participant one at ami uh where is that it's here  
yeah  
oh  
twelve frames  
um  
yeah but bob's saying maybe we should be uh including nebula and clouds  
yeah  
uh  
um  
you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply  
uh uh the <unk> uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email  
mm  
but  
no but point five point three  
and uh  
i felt like i slipped into it a lot  
um  
okay  
the clustering of the different locations over time so that you can get small clusters of speech  
yeah we can just take some snapshots  
yeah  
or just one that looks really fucking cool  
so some in some sense it intuitively it sounds very good  
yeah i think we have to wait  
missed group  
um will device appeal to all age groups  
yeah  
so we think it's important and we'd like to to do something  
<unk>  
yes i would've thought so  
so again f. f. t. is useful to do this type of analysis  
and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume  
same i believe  
mm  
so  
mm <unk>  
oh <unk>  
uh well that's something to uh think about  
technology  
yeah  
um uh  
so  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
that's right yeah  
so you need to <unk>  
i think we should go further with the idea of a removable front  
you know it could be like a lollipop or something like that something weird like that  
so a bit of titanium between  
yeah  
mm  
oh  
yeah then  
well thank you too  
okay  
so the idea is say you've got some text on a page  
yeah  
well i have at home a remote with a bridge  
yeah  
mm yep  
okay  
double a.  
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or <unk> on the side kind of menu options simple  
okay um  
do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time  
uh okay  
it makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap it stands out from the rest of the crap  
maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this yeah  
the the press buttons  
technology used  
so the way i'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work  
yes well uh uh i shall give a short talk about the the technical function design  
that one  
because see you feed something to the m. l. p. which are not the waves  
so i mean that does kind of negate the whole r. s. i. issue  
mm-hmm  
okay  
draw us a technical animal  
of the rest uh remaining fifty percent i mean are all words that appear one two three times  
mm let's see  
<unk> that's a problem with the with the text then  
stand out  
he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful strong uh i dunno  
okay  
three plus  
uh we could possibly put an l. a sort of a l. c. d. menu in but that again is probably an expense that  
so uh i bet a big company in uh korea or taiwan like uh samsung can give us uh a big discount on the chips so  
i think it's l. c. d. is better now  
though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components  
they kind of <unk> look like mole legs  
<unk> we had it was a four way split screen with me and three other people and it just stayed like that  
yeah  
i mean if it's for this job and and getting paid that that's not necessary and caroline hastings ought to be able to help you sort that out  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> yeah that can be in inside th in the structure  
our needs are  
i mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all t. v. <unk> i think  
um  
yeah <unk> well even they can have some information which are not so meaningful or uh which are not related  
did you say wool  
because <unk> <unk> in i. s. it's four uh credits and uh guillermo is taking i think he's <unk> yeah  
nobody actually it has been downloaded several times and people there are some lawyers that are putting no  
yeah okay  
thing actually  
yeah we can yeah  
i i think we could use somehow the <unk> coffee machine dialogue interface or so  
mm uh  
maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats  
i'm just thinking of uh you know an utterance consisting entirely of laughter and then putting like punctuation in like  
to my <unk> executive  
uh well yeah  
yeah because of computation  
yeah  
then if you want to send from p. g. c. then uh i mean you might already know  
sebastian  
no l. c. d.  
yeah is optional  
but it was only two hour lecture  
so this is related to traps  
i don't know  
yeah  
yeah  
maybe it's a little more curves or whatever  
so all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or  
yeah  
i'm guessing  
it won't work  
um oh yes i remember  
we will meet after  
okay  
what was trendy  
yes yeah it's a good idea  
yeah  
elegant  
if you if you make it cool to have  
well <unk> see you in a second huh  
the the money you have if you want to use so it can be good to have a wireless it it is a question  
yeah like more like photos of fruit on on our product  
yep that's fine  
yeah  
right  
look how it feels all  
yeah well i think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the  
okay  
there's something that we want from that and then there's something that we want from collaborative problem solving  
but that should be a small issue  
so um that's that's fine  
do we need to worry about um rot factors  
and it's not really a <unk>  
thank you  
so  
wooden  
nah i think it it would be nice to put the logo here for example if you have some buttons here  
<unk> i i think you'll all be paid  
mm  
i've seen one uh one remote control with only the <unk> yeah only with uh page up page down and volume but but  
well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out  
so any <unk> at least stuff where i need to be where we need to meet physically has to be done before that  
evaluation  
mm-hmm  
and the battery is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter  
but what i'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy not funny  
uh  
a special form right  
swap channels  
and um  
yeah  
if you can see this and the stars are showing that  
feasible  
uh okay  
that's definitely true  
there is still time  
yeah  
yeah exactly  
yeah  
uh  
is installing a new remote control something that people  
and uh well it all by pushing a button on the remote  
but it's when for this i would for this application i could imagine that it would were quite high  
no except uh except time  
cop copper uh material  
of doing something clever with putting these together 'cause it's hard and then putting these together 'cause it's hard  
mm-hmm  
well already digital information is sent <unk> to the the standards t. v. uh connections  
these are the basic thing  
do you like it  
mm the only thing you find is in a manufacturing process  
it's mine  
okay these are the user <unk>  
right  
okay thank you  
just one button  
yeah  
so people wanna be able to turn on the t. v. with the remote control  
it's uh  
but  
uh-huh  
uh  
hey  
for i. d.  
well kind of it it's uh uh <unk> if you had a <unk> <unk> spectrum  
and i've code on line so for this particular one  
uh-huh  
and you have to  
mm-hmm  
i mean watermelon you know <unk> probably appealing to the yeah seasonal  
the user interface designer is it a user inter user interface the technical functions design  
yeah it maybe strawberry  
when you have it on your left side and  
okay  
and how much would they use them  
um <unk> is working um as a researcher  
that would add  
yeah  
yeah  
if assuming i was for a moment i was j. p. and i wanted to know how they actually went about building the thing  
china rules  
<unk> yeah yeah yeah  
go ahead go ahead  
but to develop the data it would be a lot easier to to have the prototype  
but what about the acronym because that's has that should be in  
so uh i have another paper which might be interesting for that for a single channel uh calibration  
yeah okay  
actually this bottom red ring here just <unk> and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that  
yeah  
each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is  
yeah it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it  
and they would say you apply this algorithm yeah  
mm-hmm  
this is for one time frame  
um quite user friendly while still having technology  
that's it um i think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you  
i wanna change that  
no no no it  
oh you've got your uh induction that's right  
yeah  
you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world the same one  
no no i was thinking of so like something yeah  
mm  
but  
what i was thinking what do yous think of this  
you have to draw the  
well no it's just uh all plastic  
yeah  
uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do  
well the thing is uh you you don't  
otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that <unk> i think we <unk> i think we should  
right  
might be nice to have them all up there at same time  
plastic  
oh  
yeah  
so um take it away poppy  
make them big make them easy to uh to press  
and if we had a <unk> an on screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through like you can use your buttons to scroll through things  
don't know if i'm explaining that very well but how do i get to the next <unk> ah  
okay  
uh yes  
yeah okay  
nothing more  
if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all  
exactly  
yeah  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
um  
the thing on top  
actually it's not really an extension to the first box just an <unk> industry standard uh uh protocol between these two uh  
issues yeah  
yeah  
yeah without the numbers  
yeah i guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them  
okay  
it's just one yeah  
mm  
but if you both want not to mark it then fine don't mark it  
yeah  
so we we have to think uh in this direction  
ah  
basically it  
wow  
that might be a bit confusing though 'cause you have things on different levels  
yeah okay  
you will see patterns um  
yeah this is  
i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous like  
mm-hmm  
well regarding this f. d. l. p.  
yeah sure indeed  
uh okay  
so l. c. d. <unk> yeah definitely  
like tells you the weather and okay  
excuse me  
um and then they can say well we've we've reconstructed your speech from the speech <unk> input to the speech <unk>  
doing um voice recognition  
um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls  
mm  
yeah  
it's a sub classification of <unk>  
unless it could be okay  
really good  
you know what you can do um maybe  
or is this something for our own line of of televisions  
i like the scroll wheels uh idea  
so um it'll be like in uh monitor  
so you've got source signal  
mm  
outline our ideas  
um okay and i like it because it's small and it's fluffy  
uh mm  
i was given a brief executive summary and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at  
cool  
because i mean the the words we're look really looking for appear not too often  
you get marks for artistic impression  
okay  
yeah and usually  
yeah  
well he's really interested in  
no i didn't restart it i just closed it  
mm-hmm  
they sort of see the value of it and they wouldn't want to see it wiped out entirely definitely  
yeah yeah yeah  
<unk> we gotta teach you about this at some point though  
yep cool  
sure  
isn't that your job  
okay  
but they won't even know what examining board i got my a. levels in  
special colour  
um  
the microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism  
i think that this will be like a scroll wheel actually  
so i'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that <unk> <unk> of the two of 'em the voice recognition will be better  
so um our operating cost is twelve twenty euros  
yeah maybe  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i i like the light up suggestion  
um  
um  
well  
and of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other  
i don't know if i can touch the power button  
'kay  
yeah  
or so uh that you can choose what you want to see  
okay  
great  
yeah it was just  
and this one yeah it's a dissolve it's a dissolve so it doesn't detect yeah  
i was planning to give it a two uh where i give the not ugly uh oh yeah that's true  
if you th anything prob any problems with it um think there's a <unk> page up for that <unk> for that piece of uh for yeah for that thing  
any thing that are like free  
um well the function of a remote control as what uh we've been informed  
so use just for special options a part of the touch screen  
that's basically what we were thinking about and  
uh-huh  
<unk>  
you could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything but  
so this set up we also have here  
yeah yeah  
so i think it's it should either be a pack  
could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back and then we're uh has  
uh give some um  
so r. s. t. would be a bad theory to use  
as the data  
uh no  
now we're done  
okay well i guess i'll just take a look at the <unk> colour cube or whatever it is <unk> colour cube and look at  
no  
a couple of hours getting photo copies of degree certificates to give you for your files if i'm just gonna be here a good th they won't i think it th at one place it said give us copies of degrees  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
oh  
'cause i can take forever on this  
yeah  
oh like the phones yeah it could change colours yeah  
yeah  
uh i think so because if i think we're specially <unk> if you're going maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out  
maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with you said the logan the slogan  
is it  
okay  
<unk> uh yes mm-hmm  
we have more we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah  
like running it with different different factor loadings and seeing okay this way it works this well and this way it works that well  
<unk> what what  
okay and then how do i press the the big one to get it on to the big  
computer no signal  
to <unk> that's total of four buttons  
and if that shouldn't be marked then that shouldn't be marked  
five maybe maybe maybe six it's it's i guess it's yeah  
uh that is possible yeah  
it's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play doh but  
the they <unk> been here last week  
yes i i've seen it  
yes  
yeah  
so there are a few aspects that i collected here  
as you can see here this can be spaced for extra keys which is the design <unk>  
we can yeah  
we're doing okay  
yep  
no it was there on uh like uh yesterday morning also like even  
we still have to make those fifty million yeah  
mm-hmm  
and special material  
so it's talk to alex see if it looks like it maps by looking at the <unk>  
uh yes it is  
okay so this was the method that um i've taken  
maybe if we meet at the weekend  
i mean i think <unk> could help automatic dialogue act segmentation  
like ma  
okay  
yeah  
<unk> no from the these measures pitch etcetera  
so it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control <unk> with this functionality in a <unk> which will <unk> which will come in a few years  
mm-hmm  
because it yeah  
what else  
oh no the the the mute button misses now  
it's a different exactly  
but we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most  
you get it then  
yeah it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape  
right  
yeah  
or you can hold it and and push  
yeah you can use icons for the  
the questionnaire fill in uh we fill out <unk> after lunch or uh  
it doesn't work  
uh let's see the last meeting we went over um  
think that's that's important matter  
okay then we need  
yeah  
but i  
yeah but that's uh like industry it's really a big deal like  
yeah  
and too expensive  
for our base one  
left mouse button  
that doesn't respond also to the undo  
do we ha did we <unk> make a decision about radio galaxies  
yeah yeah  
we can't beat modern functionality we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it  
mm  
um  
right  
uh don't think that okay something nice we we can wait or sooner or later it will happen  
yeah  
i mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number we don't want like b. b. c. or c. n. n. or something else because  
ten minutes  
yeah  
okay  
maybe  
small buttons so they won't be very um how do you say  
well you'd know where they are in the  
i i don't know  
alright  
hmm  
like there's access classes all defined for that  
it'll still not extend right  
but i can come to yeah  
a mute and a teletext and a menu  
well okay but  
yes but we we we we don't want that  
yeah well we could admit to the single curve couldn't we  
hmm  
yeah  
sorry  
well hang on  
we just started our speech recognition assignment just now  
yeah  
so  
we have a wonderful  
a hundred million of them um to make twenty five euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million  
but i think lisbon those days are pretty good like seem to me quite not cold but still okay like reasonable  
okay  
mm-hmm  
and stupid  
yeah it's as optional functions  
evaluation criteria  
no i was <unk> uh doing some uh like writing some code for testing and these things where i'm making some <unk> standards for that  
good to see you all again  
mm-hmm  
um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well  
i mean it still has <unk> large buttons and not <unk> many buttons  
i yeah and it might not be there  
well each one is yes or no  
so some people are propose voice recognition and  
uh it's it's fine i think  
already <unk> said that  
speaks for itself  
yep  
what do you say <unk>  
yeah  
or  
advanced yeah  
um  
mm  
yeah  
um  
no  
no hand dynamo right  
because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything  
can provide our uh remote control  
uh in a lot of other uh  
'kay  
hmm  
i yeah i suggest here  
um does it need to be reached a de do we need to reach a decision on that right now  
um well i think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside  
or you expect different kinds of relations from some over arching set in um those different kinds of activities  
i think in the long run it's better to keep the battery  
but uh  
yeah  
i got  
mm  
for you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote  
yeah yeah  
and i hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end  
um well unfortunate but it sounds like um you guys are well placed for dealing with it  
i i've got the same problem as well  
uh from my point of view i don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh <unk> all the device  
uh so  
i i'd say <unk> two  
like a. t. and yeah yeah  
do you think it's something that uh can help you  
i don't have any information on that  
both the l. c. d.  
so thank you all everybody and see you in thirty minutes  
yeah it's a little bit uh it's the end of it  
like for me personally i think a lot of work will be done in in the last minute in this specific case  
two point three  
uh  
uh when it is pressed down um the switch is <unk> is uh is switched on  
yeah  
i just th the only thing i'm thinking is i want to make sure that it stands out as something applicable to them  
yeah so you might wanna try and come  
mm-hmm  
maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than  
yeah less likely to  
yeah it it can be uh very expensive  
i'm not sure i i'm not sure you got <unk> as well  
mm-hmm  
ah right okay  
oh you mean uh yeah bit bit rate you mean  
bit of light  
but normally that's that's when the components are not actually probably gonna be audible anyway in voiced speech right  
because there's a cap there so um depends on how much you can cram into that price  
if we don't use a scroll then we can use the simple chip  
uh if we get a scroll wheel that's a higher price range  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
so we're going for a  
oh and um to add on um <unk> information in this um interface we can have uh high tech with the voice recognition and uh  
and we weren't using line  
okay we i think we have problem  
okay  
i guess  
okay  
they can they can recharge it  
so that's great  
at the moment no  
that's what i was looking for  
yeah  
um so uh next slide if you please  
that that was uh yeah one of the most important things that uh <unk> said  
so um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant  
large  
most of them don't they have sort of a combination of the two  
mm-hmm  
mm  
the remote  
mm-hmm  
no  
and if you're both able to map into those segments then we should be able to get one file where we have like whatever two values  
right  
yeah  
hmm so we all attended <unk> no  
they gave us a <unk> a foundation of of what they want and and <unk> it's our place to kinda <unk> and evaluate  
yeah triple r. yeah you can  
i think it would be possible  
well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour  
if you just reply to that one  
uh  
yep  
yeah yeah  
no not all not all of them  
<unk>  
i just know that i i was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer  
okay  
cool okay  
yeah  
and the other one is engineer <unk> where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um  
i mean if they weren't there  
okay okay it's fine  
yeah  
people don't wanna spend more money on their remote control i guess  
yeah that's the other th  
alright we have five minutes left  
apparently it's what people want so  
yeah  
mm  
use for the other ones well but uh i <unk> think uh i forgot to do put done under the first one  
yeah  
<unk>  
but you will have the battery there for when you need it  
this means i can go home  
with it <unk> if it <unk> the requirement or not  
um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control  
hmm  
yeah  
you know every black triangle has a different i. d.  
like it says very simple you just take out the pen  
yeah  
yeah that's that's what i'm thinking that  
just what i needed was something exciting  
okay  
so you didn't have any p. for these p. l. p. <unk> no p. l. p. <unk> or p. files from p. l. p.  
yeah  
um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of  
possibly off line you can uh group them into um a speech segment  
okay  
and there's not high excitation  
right  
<unk>  
okay  
yeah the german stuff  
i think more <unk>  
only good thing is that the numbers i think i pretty much can recover all the even the <unk> <unk> experiments  
that's correct  
no  
okay  
yeah yeah  
so  
yep  
actually i'm not reading microphone there so that's why you can all have conversation it just to speak to you  
what what does it have to have  
okay  
yeah  
a bit crazy i don't think that's we're necessarily going for  
okay  
what do we do back here  
alright let me just <unk> this up  
but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons  
when i think of it uh i think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh  
and then we had uh just uh two buttons we place them in the middle uh the menu and for the teletext i thought that was th  
if you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it  
by lyman alpha forest and lyman limit systems  
yeah  
so i don i think i think it's a three  
yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics  
so you know it it treats it as a fixation around blinks and it also just happens to tell you where the blinks are  
but  
yeah i understand  
will this remote control be easy to find when lost  
so i was doing the is anyway  
well  
right  
oh okay  
probably two  
people thought their remotes were ugly um  
mm-hmm  
we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it  
the  
we can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it  
um  
of the questions  
yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to  
yeah that's on the t. v. yeah  
they want it uh  
are you <unk>  
okay so i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design  
mm-hmm  
but i think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the l. c. d. screen  
or do we really need the scroll wheel as well  
well you could you could put one point one when the other ones only go up to the one  
um <unk> actually has a lot of phone calls to make and uh it's true that her activity is quite noisy when she's there  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
does it have smart materials  
yeah  
<unk> fine  
i mean  
i if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that but just like this and you know follow follow well  
so you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature  
that's true but uh at same instant same happens when uh you have remote control  
uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and <unk>  
hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time  
but of course the there's only two two different kinds of words  
but  
and if we have the budget for it  
yeah but we have you the the voice recognition no  
maybe something that sounds cool in english but sounds funny in spanish  
mm-hmm  
sorry  
uh i think there's something wrong with your  
okay  
true  
yeah yeah  
i i think they can  
anything else to say at all  
right  
that'd be  
that's nice one  
yeah  
yeah well that's uh yeah  
yeah well uh when we lose one scroll wheel it's okay  
um chips the what chips we need and what uh  
but  
yeah  
right particularly in technological fields so that's exactly where we're headed  
cool  
thinking i'm gonna have to go back and find my places where i've had someone pausing and then saying yeah yeah and then this that i've not had i need to go back and find uh <unk> put <unk> in  
but uh i haven't thought about it  
what do you think  
yeah  
yep finished  
th the design of it but that's not a big seller  
yeah that's true that's true  
there's something strange about the way how they access the hard disk how they mount it which is unfortunate  
that's the first slide  
but i guess it could be  
i if you do f. uh f. n. f. eight again it's it'll  
opens up is too difficult or uh  
ah okay  
so if you say a probability of topic one for uh for page uh z.  
yeah i uh it's sunday i always use it for the uh yeah for the soccer uh  
well i'm the i i'm the designer so um  
um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting  
okay is that my turn then  
right  
yep  
whatever  
mm-hmm  
and  
oh you mean <unk> because it's it's it's the m. m. m. cache  
yeah  
very good  
no they ne <unk> was done uh uh well <unk> itself was done actually long time ago at <unk>  
yeah  
it won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch  
well what if we're going to now decide about the functions and the design comes into the next round  
it's there but it's  
components concepts and user interface concepts  
no it hasn't been  
no yeah  
brilliant  
hmm  
well the thing is it's s. v. g.  
mm-hmm  
so i am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use  
um  
yeah  
hard plastic the buttons should be uh rubbery i think uh  
darn computer  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh but i think it's he he doesn't use i guess because uh uh then like you just you take these features and you train model so  
'kay  
okay there's  
so that's that's a big advantage i think  
thanks guys  
the  
um i think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh i don't think there's too many  
now  
so that's uh that's uh just a list  
uh  
and the electronics we decided on it being just a simple the easiest  
i re should have kept the p. l. p. also somewhere <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
no  
<unk> yeah yeah overlap  
if it's a word fragment who cares  
so and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we <unk> that we have only ten digits  
i think it might mean something like that <unk> shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what  
okay perfect  
we have to something special  
uh yeah it's very <unk> for sure  
yeah  
so that's ten  
mm-hmm  
hum  
well i <unk> i like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the <unk> the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh  
did it it could just be fluent on the laptop for all i know  
okay  
yeah alright well  
so  
uh the output file x. m. l.  
that's the classical design  
your screen  
yeah  
it's too expensive  
that's the question  
and you know there may be times when you wanna treat that as one thing right  
possible  
and the same holds for the uh  
mm  
that's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design  
i think they th there were thirteen thousand in the entire corpus  
so we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven isn't it with everything we want on  
we have forty minutes  
mm  
i don't think you need the power so  
uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits mute button a separate menu for teletext a battery indicator  
'kay  
'cause it's stolen  
yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah  
hmm  
yeah but yeah  
uh they have  
it slows it down a bit  
yeah but but we can make a docking station for two euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it  
yellow  
what do you think uh mister project manager  
yeah probably yeah  
yeah exactly  
and and i i don't i don't even know whether the i don't even know whether the <unk> the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed  
okay  
right kendra  
right  
um well the <unk> just like uh sebastian said um the remote should work on different t. v. <unk> or even different uh um  
um maybe one of you could write it down  
yeah  
and what what's happening what what do you foresee happening in the next couple of years  
i've got  
oh it's so cute  
well we hope  
is that so  
to a television  
i mean if you have a firm <unk> sub structure you can then incorporate articulation into that  
true  
maybe i was panicking for no reason  
okay  
okay okay  
okay we got five minutes to go in this meeting  
um  
something something new  
well uh we can't do that  
also when you when you screw it up you <unk> start again  
that um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we <unk> we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly <unk>  
mm-hmm  
uh  
so is it possible  
it's the same it's just it's not very clear before the so called  
they're stuck under menu  
looks like we going for a double curved design  
does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable  
so something like this  
like real eye track traces then you might find that a little bit disconcerting  
no  
maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where <unk> you generally get one and then forget about it  
will give us design problem because we have  
fruit and vegetable  
we take it to the other meeting okay  
we have five minutes to finish our meeting  
yeah  
and i think we discussed earlier on the r. s. i. problem thing so we could uh  
yeah  
even you  
no the thing is like you can't really write this <unk> i suppose uh the code is the real problem scripts is okay like yeah  
so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something  
when are we going to produce it  
but the the the the long uh the longest frame you would use would be one hundred  
um sure it's not to test our artistic  
working on the design  
okay  
okay  
mm  
okay  
we could take out a curve indeed  
you got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t. v. and um  
so meeting's over  
okay  
yeah  
uh  
uh  
yeah kinda like old cars uh  
hmm  
continuum source shouldn't be in  
so  
and u. i. d. it's for the user interface designer yeah  
<unk>  
usually not a car and all of those things  
and uh yeah now the meeting room is busy  
we might have to  
uh  
concatenate all those shouldn't be too bad  
um that's just my view right now  
ah yeah parameter okay  
yeah  
um of course as we we've already talked about the personal face plates in this meeting and i'd like to stick to that  
so it's just gonna say from here to here they're doing something  
uh  
you like that i try to to to solve this problem and try to say that there is a time problem and you don't have the time to do it  
there should be some flexibility in <unk>  
um then if you want to do anything more advanced  
so it just sort of  
speech recognition in  
but if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go  
and thirdly the remote would be easy to use  
yeah  
how do i hook my screen up  
yes  
but what is this  
do you think <unk>  
you have to  
if you like held it down that would be on off  
because it automatically displays at the correct position when you hover  
um so yeah  
i kind of am wanting to say on the t. v. 'cause if you're changing the brightness don't you wanna see it happening kind of  
yeah  
right  
okay  
yeah  
hmm  
okay  
so it's good for the speed  
yeah  
yellow  
okay that sounds like a a good strong idea  
kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing  
well if you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine then go for that option  
yep  
yeah  
i don't think so eh  
well it depends who your who's what the target people are like you'd say  
so four and  
well we've we've got um that it's remote for t. v. only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations  
and uh this is rubber  
two  
th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window  
mm probably heuristic it will be easier to compute because  
mm-hmm so mm  
right  
um so  
mm-hmm  
does this there any wishes for dictionaries  
yeah  
and it just seems to me that if you've gotta have two <unk> separate apparatuses for the um speaker internal um argument structure and the group argument structure  
you can try out the eraser now  
oh oops  
no no i just for  
um  
you lazy  
yeah it's like a yeah  
we have also button for volume and to switch on off the t. v.  
we could have a little l. e. d. <unk> on each end  
okay  
play doh <unk>  
but it's not just a data format change it's actually some kind of computational process to get the thing out of it as well right  
yeah  
well done  
function f. five  
auto regressive model and excitation signal  
because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do  
adjusting  
yeah  
because uh my cat is red uh at home  
alright  
um one thing is interesting is talking about  
stay longer  
but you can use rechargeable batteries anyway just you <unk> you have to recharge them manual  
no but the most important buttons <unk> maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would  
yeah  
you can uh  
i have to go to a <unk>  
yeah yeah but i'm <unk> i'm saying for the whole thing in the end  
that's the most import  
i th  
'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right handed people than left handed people but  
sure  
yeah  
do you want this one here  
i don't know  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
what did you think about uh  
but it's just done off line and everyone can ha represent it anyway they want as long as they sort of store it in a useful x. m. l. representation in the end  
that's that's no task for me but well seven to seven at least yeah but  
we've got a cool prototype  
no i have it working  
why can't i see the crazy  
yeah i didn't even know they existed  
uh we <unk> basically need to operate an electronic device  
it yes  
we have a pear  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well kind of  
i personally think that a round <unk> button looks bit silly but  
also  
and or sixty six enter <unk>  
uh fronts  
so like there are all these like links they don't go anywhere  
monday is the  
tuning them in at the very start  
to change to the next channel just one button  
yes or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far  
yeah we we can just uh use this one  
that's the main reason  
i am disappointed i didn't get a note back from my personal coach  
it's how you it's how you look at it  
about one point <unk> one point eight  
but there's a problem  
yep  
still he waited at the  
three six nine divided by five so five  
oh very good celebration  
hmm  
so that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user  
like colour and then volume and uh  
so that we'll use the <unk>  
if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free without any object  
um why that why that should be your favourite animal  
oh really  
uh alright well thanks  
it's for the vision  
it  
i don't know if it's possible to to watch something on t. v.  
it was like well it was a little <unk> than that  
yeah yeah okay because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product  
um as for the energy source um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting  
yeah yeah  
um  
i had this one um in one of the first dialogues i did the <unk> this guy called ed  
yep  
yeah  
which we don't mark yeah  
no no  
okay  
and the leadership was excellent  
yeah  
there's the number task isn't there  
yeah  
yeah  
okay so we have a few  
yeah sure  
um  
okay  
i was  
mm-hmm  
personally like i might reverse it but if we're working for this company then i guess no matter what we have to stress fashion the most  
no it's e. t. s. a. or something  
only ten percent  
and that is like the most standard type of button  
so <unk> like ericsson does every uh  
um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus  
but  
um this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers  
sure  
<unk> actually yeah it should be embedded  
yeah  
yeah  
or or one button to exit it  
check  
yeah  
okay i'm sorry  
oh  
oh i need to muck around with this  
yeah  
basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um  
hmm  
anyway  
that means that at least like we don't have the type of situation where somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on line  
um  
no  
normally we use to fix it window for feature extraction like twenty five milliseconds or thirty seconds  
on the other hand i would think  
sorry what is your  
if you drop it it it just breaks  
you're right though i think  
okay  
relevance of two out of ten yeah  
maybe actually if it if there's one word which is very typical i mean it's probably some word like uh  
they are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often  
about five minutes  
in different fruit and vegetable colours yeah  
yeah  
so that's what people seem to yeah i i know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and  
'kay  
and then maybe sort of an enter button for  
leadership  
you know our results go down when we truly are getting meeting yeah  
yeah  
i think we we should use something like this um to um  
hmm  
yeah  
i have a rough idea  
so  
hmm  
it could be very flat could be very small  
and uh right so thanks for that  
yeah  
did we change anything  
um the basic components are an energy source which i guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply  
but uh  
i usually just change channels  
well uh <unk> battery we use uh about uh  
um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power would be my one query  
uh we should save that one  
um i think it might be smart to look at uh <unk> um information first because i understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation  
yeah  
uh yeah it's uh a little bit same  
okay uh  
a line ratio is a thing  
six seven eight about yeah nine total  
master of  
okay right  
the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes  
yeah  
if they were made out of rubber  
and then he will beeps and to say that i am here for example  
where is the solar cell  
no not at all  
it no it's two batteries we need  
so maybe we should leave all d. v. d. and v. c. r. related features off completely  
okay  
so we have the power button  
mm-hmm  
but this is one yeah  
yeah  
and some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all  
they're definitely needed  
uh thank you very much indeed  
well during my work i have no time either  
mm  
but then we come to the costs  
mm-hmm  
yeah well i use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer huh  
no  
yeah  
ye yeah <unk>  
well here it's it was cache because i already pressed preview but now it's on the fly  
okay i think that that's doing it now  
do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can <unk> mail stuff to each other  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so i'll present myself i'm ada <unk> and as you may know it i'm the <unk> project manager  
it'll be down  
ah a big jump  
oh  
exactly  
yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again  
um  
did you also order  
yeah  
well just  
yeah but the well it's already been done  
remember we have a <unk> budget for the cost of producing the remote controller  
but let's see what's what they want now  
okay then lunchtime yay  
yeah  
okay  
which is the bulb of course  
i we'll go for a three  
so  
yeah  
that happens above also  
well <unk> yeah i it's not uh i it's an inherent problem to the geometry you use  
i think last time yes but that's not what we want is it  
seeing as it's quite a new technology  
yeah  
oh  
yeah that's probably uh a population <unk> quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway  
okay  
um criteria six  
okay  
not in the master class  
good  
to make it um to <unk> uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a <unk> um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable  
uh just  
and i will admit i don't know what r. s. i. stands for  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah but  
i can live with it  
right  
basically that's why i like cats  
so  
so what do you think  
the average is about six and something  
l. p. c.  
general project what's i in for example i thou i thought we were pretty creative in what we created  
so l. c. d. <unk> out is speech rec out now  
okay  
we should probably just use conventional batteries  
yeah  
uh well just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section have i just lost oh no  
yeah  
is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
alright  
mm-hmm  
i think so i think so you can do it  
do we need some sort of display  
yep  
we're done i think  
forty minutes  
i mean the the shape of the remote control  
okay  
uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote <unk> the power to the battery comes through infrared  
yeah  
yeah that i can get all those things  
we should we should be below twelve point five  
and then they also secure uh covers to protect  
i think  
mm  
so we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some <unk> artistic meaning  
you can just create a new account for yourself and where it <unk> it actually has a send from address  
um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories  
can i give you the no  
you go you so the basic mode yeah  
you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a  
a curvature is like the this case  
that's that's uh what yeah uh <unk> it is  
um  
well that's right  
oh a blank  
okay  
i uh it's not this one  
you haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh paris  
because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of  
i don't think i at any stage in my life i would want a banana remote control really  
and yeah that's it for me  
so it's basic  
and there's gonna be other things like getting the technology ready  
if you have any questions about spellings i i i think i <unk> might have sent an email to this effect just check the oxford english dictionary online  
here okay  
even the memories are not really yeah  
<unk>  
but we could still make uh a remote control that <unk> uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already  
with our without  
hmm  
i had to admit as soon as <unk> we started i mean as soon as we got the play doh  
yeah  
hmm  
i don't think  
so it has to be yeah it's <unk> they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do  
but on the t. v.  
but now you have a totally different  
well the id okay the notion of yeah i mean i it's not like i have a concept of a <unk> material it's just it is what it is  
ah <unk> okay  
yeah  
um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable  
well yes  
yeah yeah  
i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something is it  
whatever the frame rate is you know ten seconds a minute  
but who who is the one who who is now developing the <unk> and these things  
yeah  
mm  
in this directory  
well for drawing for drawings  
yeah  
you press a plus button  
and go to standby mode when you don't use it so that  
so if i don't know what components to put in it's kind of hard  
uh i think it's possible by playing a little bit with the furniture  
yeah right  
yeah  
you can pack all that onto was onto a single control  
it's more <unk> i can't quite see why it's important to know that they can do it just based on the language when <unk> you know that they had both  
so you're you've got books that high on your desk  
um are the costs within budget  
it was showing that  
all of them  
six  
oh  
real react  
i didn't get anything  
no no only the t. v. channel with the with uh with uh four <unk>  
so i think it's the best solution to make those <unk> custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your <unk> uh your budget  
mm  
so if you want to have the conclusion as a three three  
uh senses that a connection has been made and know and knows what button you pressed <unk> uh for example the the volume up or volume down button  
you know what it does so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open  
i just had an half an hour <unk> to study it and i don't get it  
right right  
i just don't know  
yeah  
you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen  
we have the lightning or  
although for actual design i'd say the response time should be a little bit higher because  
do you know what this is  
that's but this but number three yes  
yeah no  
now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control  
oh there's emission from the narrow line region yeah  
and uh the teletext uh button  
get lost off the remote controller so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of <unk> uh on side of the  
good  
just <unk> have a seat for a second  
okay  
right  
can you imagine you have to scroll a lot  
a bit more than real time  
it's not what you said previously  
i got an email about the dis about the discussion  
yeah why not  
yeah i think it's uh uh well technologically using it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features  
right yeah  
so  
thank you very much  
evaluation drops  
how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today  
um  
that's uh i'm al i'm almost finished so  
so instead we've um this is gonna be an l. c. d. screen um just a a very very basic one  
okay okay  
yeah  
i mean there's always we can always have these <unk> less often used functions hidden somewhere under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some  
two  
uh standard text  
and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal  
for example a little t. v. guide  
perfect  
to fit the the  
so anyway so that's something we should probably do in one way or another because it seems just that the overwhelming majority of dice machines don't have sound card  
is that a large enough target market to target it  
i don't know  
yeah  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
oh  
'cause he says yeah okay thursday afternoon i've got completely free  
okay  
but uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have <unk> uh light  
yeah  
the major ones yeah  
okay  
and the the marketing expert will do the first project evaluation  
uh  
but it has at least one innovation  
hmm  
okay  
alright is it it's ready  
something we should get  
but those are the basic function that people use it for so those should be very well represented  
i'm not exactly sure what these things look like  
or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily  
no  
a <unk> just uh rubber uh for for t. v. so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel  
oh  
yeah but but the teletext button  
yeah but if you would i it is a new feature it it's something special  
i don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss  
no you have to scroll through the menu before  
well right i think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah i guess those thin lines or i mean they're windows or okay  
i'm not sure how it if it if it can do sound or not  
that's not possible  
be 'cause  
it's it's fine  
i mean i the mouse we're just saying where is the mouse  
fair enough  
yeah but we just have one button  
it's not there's no sharp  
i don't  
i think you're right on both of them  
leads to user face yeah  
mm  
yeah  
so that's to that's i mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people  
a little bit bigger with easier <unk>  
um that you know it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury  
you all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh  
yeah  
but i think i think is it's too it's going very be very to be very good for them to <unk> how you can <unk> things and maybe what they can do  
um but it does have internal structures will just make it easy to do the the x. m. l.  
when it is uh  
you're in the triangle region  
everything you loaded was also  
then you can put features like whether they're <unk> or like <unk> <unk> or m. f. c. c. <unk> or whatever  
would we put that on the inside or  
yeah but yeah  
mm-hmm  
and <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
can i ask a question  
both the process and the um the final results and  
it i  
oh that's okay it's <unk>  
so that's a you have to tune lot of parameters like i am  
so but  
but it's different from what we've been doing  
yeah  
project documents yeah  
i mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says uh on which number do you want to save this  
um  
i can't see how it wouldn't i mean there's you know the old aphorism you can have it fast  
fashion  
so that was two  
but um i did have one thing from a previous meeting  
and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on t. v. and such  
you can make it look like an easy <unk> piece of equipment but it's quite elaborated uh because it has many functions  
mm-hmm  
uh first i'll uh i'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose uh show you some samples uh  
uh  
a three  
yeah  
classic  
the only thing that's been going around is the version of the flier  
doesn't say it's associated with what  
yeah  
oh do i  
yeah press that is <unk> yeah that might work  
four  
they're all kind of just push button right  
um <unk> well yeah  
so  
so that's that's a step for this  
yeah  
yeah it it has to touch the corners i guess  
so yeah  
i don  
um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate  
like internet on the on t. v.  
and that's interesting in terms of uh i mean first of all again is measurable in terms of browsing  
one thing we will have to do is we want we'd really want a different <unk> if we clicked on a whole meeting than a segment  
but i it's just a yeah it's it's cheap  
yeah  
okay  
not too much not too too too too  
no  
it shouldn't be difficult should it  
mm  
mm  
so um as a group i think we've are they're accepting the minutes  
okay  
uh-huh  
yeah and the conceptual and functional  
okay  
'kay  
um  
i'd like to share in the coffee machine profits because that's really doing well  
cool  
yeah so something <unk> <unk> instead of a <unk> yeah grip i'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands  
more than all the other buttons  
just one  
oh yeah lets me try  
but i think if you to <unk> numbers it's a well studied problem  
uh yeah  
yeah  
so i'm right  
of the of the process  
anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that  
yeah  
okay  
and when it happens one is always masking the other in practice  
um  
right  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i'm gonna <unk> uh write some stuff down and then we're ready  
i don't think able cluster is different from cluster  
okay  
so  
if uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say  
no  
yeah just one big curve  
i'd say three i mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible  
yep  
the <unk> components  
so <unk> not only for switzerland but for the world  
okay  
okay  
because <unk>  
but otherwise we're doing it the same way that they are doing it  
well <unk> we have curves in all directions  
just try  
oh if it let's well we will see what's possible concerning the the costs and if it's possible we'll do that  
so that's a good sign 'cause it shows that he's not hell bent on  
um  
yeah  
okay  
in switchboard  
okay  
thanks  
this is it  
yeah yeah yeah it's a <unk> like a plastic cover so  
for the information density and we just tie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker changes  
hmm  
people welcome back  
but i think we don't have a specific audience you know  
to handle  
exactly  
<unk>  
yeah  
i'm down for a week  
yeah  
they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers so they can choose what colour the outside is  
i think we have a good  
that was it  
oh oh like depth of the actual thing  
uh his last day was the thirty first of october  
okay  
uh-huh  
as also program ma manager  
yes true one  
alright  
oh okay  
spongy means <unk>  
ooh  
would you be able to give an example  
so  
and i think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use l. c. d.  
hmm  
the buttons are rubber  
again <unk> no given relatively everyday product i think we've <unk> very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh  
yes also uh to to extract the context  
okay  
well i but he wasn't gonna be booking any time to us after the thirty first of october  
and then this c. g. i. programme ask the mm parameter c. video and m. equals <unk> okay demo one  
so the l. c. d.  
yes  
well th these are details  
you you could  
okay  
yeah but this is very rare  
but of course if we have this in two years maybe okay it's good we have it  
now they keep combining all different remotes together and i don't know if i necessarily like that 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload  
so <unk> let's start with the cost aspect so so i look at the aspect discussed last time that is to say uh to have a standard battery  
you will receive further instruction by emails as usual  
i agree on two  
on on on those ones small values  
yeah  
sorry uh is uh if you're pressing up and down you can easily press the okay once you when you're not already at your choice  
no i don't think we need to i think the r. and r. especially if the yellow and black one  
then we have the buttons  
and hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive  
hmm okay okay  
uh  
not too many discussions  
so we have this  
i think curved means just curved in one axis and double curved is curved in two axes  
right okay  
mm  
<unk>  
uh we have a hand dynamo which we yeah we dutch refer to it as the <unk>  
yeah <unk> uh as colours do you do you have the picture in uh  
like fruit  
is that possible to use or no  
uh you put it in the  
i goin i'm going to share with you  
um so that if <unk> a if so that the finger is <unk> each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already  
i'm rose and i'm project manager from california  
oh my bad  
the strawberries oh  
we need to <unk> the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else  
then you'll lose it yeah  
mm  
on the the <unk> the rubbery grips could be grey  
oh okay  
<unk>  
i mean the <unk> the best ones are definitely those on the first screen here  
okay  
view a slide show that's what you wanna do yeah  
yeah a paragraph each  
yeah it depends on the job  
um in  
yeah okay  
no i <unk> i don't think it makes a lot of difference  
oh but this is by speaker here which makes it slightly more difficult  
<unk> right for a single channel it's not very meaningful  
first on the market  
things and few more colours  
younger age sixteen and forty five  
yeah  
now we have it  
and if we see early that clearly uh there i  
okay  
uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design etcetera etcetera  
but if you have to power the for ten minutes then the  
yeah  
yeah  
so what do you think would be the price it would be out of range  
not at all  
what we <unk> yeah  
oh  
yeah  
yeah 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
but for example what we also found is that if you use just the hilbert envelope  
so i think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can <unk> your remote control  
mm  
maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote  
hmm  
oh um i had some uh examples  
sammy <unk>  
um uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements  
yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it  
mm-hmm  
so that it has and also <unk> plastic i've seen can get really textured so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand  
mm  
are we gonna use that as one of our functions  
right  
yes i think it should be something like that  
um that might be getting you know too specific and we should see what the success of the first face plates are  
now i haven't thought about any of the <unk> for this  
also  
mm-hmm  
but if you choose to use multiple channels  
oh like this came from las vegas  
ooh we like rubber ooh  
only a buck  
i never thought  
the do do you see a problem with having a <unk> a room just for a lounge or no  
okay  
and <unk>  
and that would probably um i <unk> well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design  
you know if you're not steeped in these theories that it makes a huge difference to you whether we use r. s. t. or something like s. d. r. s.  
yeah but we have <unk> we have to talk about the lights uh  
right  
no it's not  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
great  
alright  
essentially okay  
doesn't work does it  
alright  
uh was it included in the cost  
yep  
alright  
can probably add a open file dialogue box with minimum effort because i think it's a ready made component that returns a string for a file name  
yes  
no i don't have any costs here i only have percentages  
which just partition these uh  
let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about <unk> the current remote controls what they like  
and a mute yeah  
the uh device is easy to find if you lose it  
um  
okay  
and would it have to be twice that  
and <unk> the fancy and that's exactly the term i'm i'm thinking polished elegant you know kind of innovative but a cut above  
and then i got that thing  
like you have a little just just a text only not colour just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a t. v. guide  
okay so we have two two three  
in the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons  
yes  
yeah  
yeah i mean it's a so sometimes very difficult  
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these  
um because it would be varying quite rapidly wouldn't it your um your uh code book  
yeah  
but i mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well  
and my thought is um we've got <unk> if we're gonna go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um  
i don't know  
so are there any um improvements or issues or  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
group  
then tandem system  
yes  
ye  
take it  
it  
<unk> hoo  
yeah  
the <unk> yeah  
okay thank you very much  
so  
mm  
yeah that's what what is missing  
yeah it works  
mm-hmm  
nothing special  
and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it  
okay  
yep  
yeah  
yeah  
uh so i i probably draw it down raw scheme  
mm  
well i don't know  
because the <unk> the problem i can see with with the voice or the gesture itself <unk> what can happen in a family i i for example if  
um  
and just put uh volume change or <unk> <unk> can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control  
mm  
some x. m. l. files and i was thinking if we maybe just should go through some of them and like try to see if you understand the general structure and pool together what we think about the structure  
started here  
so uh  
it uh <unk> it can go open  
yeah it is big and you do have to scroll through it to see what's going on  
we have forty minutes for this uh discussion  
if it was hydrogen align you would so you should mark if it was or h. beta absorption  
it looks amazing  
continuum source does that count  
so this doesn't go so fast this way  
but we say uh we <unk> we said solar  
it's yeah  
i mean i for example you can't use r. s. t. across speakers because the definitions of the relations depend on the intentions of the speaker and there's different speakers have different intentions  
yeah  
do don't do that please  
even uh  
you lose this one you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve for example  
so i think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus it's very hard to do  
so we put this on top and then make the corporate logo  
yeah  
it's strange  
group k.  
um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board for instance  
you know i think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing so  
either you have voice recognition by itself which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet  
no they aren't  
zero  
if you want to browse in addition to the t. v. or uh or it should be a special t. v. connected to  
i dunno about you guys but i felt like  
so but i think if i this is a log out command and usually it resets this amazing strange colour combinations i see in front of me at the moment  
um  
that's also maybe an idea  
a a also better but of course it depends on the number of of parameters you put  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um basically this is about a uh a new <unk> remote control  
oh  
you have code book  
on advanced chip  
so you could trigger that to a light like i said the bouncing ball thing  
that okay  
should we do that  
uh i i will focus on user interface design  
you know it's good to have some numbers if you can come up with some numbers uh  
we have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need  
i i thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different  
yeah it's yeah  
so you have the original speech so i the <unk> speech is there any words which are not matching  
mm  
and then uh  
i mean ha we had the <unk> were compulsory because um a lot of students were doing <unk> were doing teaching  
okay i think this is more a job to our market person yeah  
or at least you know the  
um as for you know the the case design uh maybe i'll come up with more concrete ideas  
uh well we made an investigation of the market by <unk>  
oh yeah yeah  
but but you don't you never use the blue bag you don't ask the people to look at the blue bag  
the information goes to the chip which is somewhere here and the chip that <unk> then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation  
even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven we were to go down a grade to to four  
okay  
it looks like there's a it looks like a butterfly  
so  
start over  
so you know on one side it's pretty good but on the other you don't know which way you should go 'cause there are many of them  
okay  
yes  
maybe we'll discuss this later no  
okay  
i can't even but if you said  
not sure what software i have at the moment which would be hello  
it doesn't take that much place and also that much it doesn't cost that much  
yeah uh  
yeah in the for uh frequency it is  
in  
okay a <unk> a teletext button should be there  
is very high i mean the number of points that are matching  
i have no idea  
yeah  
<unk> cheapest way i think  
maybe maybe not  
the product is is is uh <unk> high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced  
two copies of the same thing will be existing  
so as long as and what we'll have done is just gonna set up so the uh whatever the asterisk sound is on windows is what gets played  
like with some  
but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down but it would actually go up because of the shape  
uh-huh  
ask our r. and d. department  
so um this is one i've gone through  
i dunno i think we had a fair bit of creativity  
if in the l. c. d. we can scroll right  
oh so <unk> you want our um <unk> presentations in there hey  
sorry  
well her the relations have a <unk>  
otherwise yeah we just it just becomes cost prohibitive  
on the t. v. screen the uh how to use your remote  
you should be rea  
whatever  
because finally face find i do have something else  
yeah  
and  
or that we're finished with the old one  
you know <unk> <unk> well less than or equal to one times per hour  
um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward  
yes  
okay  
i think no real project in common so i wonder  
mm-hmm  
um  
with the with our laptops with the all uh all this  
yeah  
i'll send it from p. g. c. so if anyone replies it would just go to that account and any of us can access it at any time  
it does not say anything about uh whether technically you know this this stuff is available at all  
in which case it just waits until you stop <unk> and then you know displays that station  
mm i'm not sure about that  
then we have two  
and i quite like it 'cause it's just smooth and hand held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out  
um  
or you want it to be six  
either call or email someone  
so  
yeah so yes he's supposed this is your <unk> window  
so we are so  
it's still too expensive yeah  
okay  
<unk> yeah but then the a. g. n. like activity  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
um now i've got <unk> running on machines and i think they're set up correctly  
so that could be a great um application  
so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in <unk> under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half euros  
is it possible to find out anyway  
yeah but i  
and the regular chip  
hmm  
yeah that's not the idea  
yeah  
that's why 'cause it's nasty  
so it i'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of <unk> marketing  
so you can program your coffee maker that when you say good morning to it it says hello rick or whatever  
yeah it's in the it's in the folder yeah  
okay  
so the the two at the centre uh where is written <unk> <unk> the two visitors and then maria plus david  
i don't have any emails  
yeah  
so i can uh show my uh investigation  
he was asking <unk> so what's new that you are so famous with that and they <unk> they said okay we we know exactly how to do that  
but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control to a much greater extent  
okay  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah i mean i can do it  
it's  
i mean you can eventually have uh a supervision role in the sense that you think that i i know how to do it  
did you give a functional  
and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across  
mm-hmm  
well a lot a lot of t. v. <unk> indeed show uh when you uh zap to a  
to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder which is on your desktop at least it should be  
yeah like on the side of it  
yes understand  
<unk>  
just just to use to find it when it was lost  
fu <unk> okay so do what do you mean full  
let's let's go for the hand dynamo then  
yeah  
is yours the  
okay  
okay <unk>  
and some of the bold colours into a simple  
but there are definitely some considerations  
mm  
i mean there'll be <unk> we have to work out the uh number the plus system  
okay  
it's not yeah  
yep  
um well the detailed design meeting huh  
and i then can select i can select on the dings it goes to the next page  
yeah  
uh <unk> like <unk> we can we can put some uh double r.  
yes  
or are these two curves  
of plastic  
and you you don't need that for a t. v.  
yeah  
yeah  
now we put uh rubber around it  
you you can yeah  
okay  
depends on the l. c. d.  
eight three  
okay  
i'd use an remote control  
and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people  
and a little bit about same people moving with the clustering  
yes  
yeah right  
oh okay yes that is  
'kay  
so uh if you have uh drawn something save it  
wait a minute  
yeah uh again i'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet  
the thing is you have <unk> normally with um with buttons  
great  
yeah  
yeah i know but but it but that's fancy in the way um  
now this what we're talking about here or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly  
yeah  
alright okay  
it's a <unk> kind of elliptical is it  
okay now it's time for some discussion  
work on these ideas and try to make a  
as long as we design it as long as we design it before hand uh i think we can probably manage to actually do it in the three days after  
mm-hmm  
people are right handed or left handed so <unk> because i am left handed i use like this  
and our oh yeah it's a <unk> yeah  
well i don't i'm not really sure how much that will retail at  
clay  
or you can put in the l. c. d. <unk> uh window an option get out  
oh i got  
if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that <unk> sub menu  
yeah  
okay  
i'm not sure we will talk too much about that today  
yeah but for example i made a file that contains just the um start times  
okay  
yeah but i think definitely you are the best person here to with uh related to availability of you  
sorry i'm doing something wrong  
mm-hmm  
okay so one  
personally  
it's the final design yeah  
well we could give it a specific code you know remote missing  
why not  
otherwise i can see if i can still understand like i did it in my programme  
which is something somehow we would like to relax uh because uh people uh like in it's you may not want each time to ask the person  
so we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting so for now we get uh the <unk> this is the functional designer  
yeah  
um maybe i could ask one of you to uh fill it in so that i can also uh take minutes  
a and you can rule out something like that right  
um  
that's true i guess we we probably have some time maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do go back to um  
we're inspired by latest fashion not only electronics but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design  
yeah  
so where's the battery battery  
okay  
yeah i know carrot  
yeah  
yeah <unk> yeah  
uh yeah sorry  
mm  
okay  
so maybe it's not no  
<unk>  
okay so trend watching  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components  
and um the buttons well we talked about it now  
mm-hmm  
i think it will  
maybe hynek will know much more  
then i have to come with it  
i got a how do i start there  
it's actually important to note that the television uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that that i it actually is edible inside  
yeah  
yes i think so too  
yes i can go ahead  
but there's still some degree of fitting and it's steep you're saying  
yep  
this this stuff that marius  
and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber <unk> into these little holes that activate  
okay good  
so thank you very much  
but um you know we could discuss um those other options that you brought up genevieve  
mm well or maybe they just don't use mm anything like that i suppose for  
i then i think i <unk> i don i don't think they me mean they're special  
yeah  
yeah  
okay where was it  
okay  
if we don't have so many buttons could be nice  
the name  
we have to take uh every everyone into account  
uh i heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already  
yes  
are we ready to start  
yeah  
but um yeah  
'cause otherwise i think i  
interface type  
i think so  
yes  
i hereby officially close the meeting and uh i hope to see you uh soon  
a new summary  
yeah in the <unk> it'd be the uh ideal place to do that  
mm  
it's working  
okay it's your turn now  
i mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes  
right on time  
but maybe guillaume you can tell no  
radio loud counts yeah  
i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so  
and the information or <unk> i mean we are going to create a file that looks more like um the words file  
six  
or if you our users in mind like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design  
mm they didn't have too much fun grabbing  
um for uh our industrial designer you're gonna be thinking about the components concept  
looking at areas within it  
so this is not the you know this is something we're aiming for  
right  
yeah <unk> upgrade  
we will take that  
uh  
i'm just just throwing out ideas  
you're fired  
we'll we'll look at uh  
and you can't say looking over here  
or before the before the the design that says  
no because it yeah people are accustomed to that it's  
like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote  
so i  
so  
but that it's also gonna be the case that um whatever region you define as the region of the dynamic object of the red triangle may get to the point where it overlaps the region of the dynamic object of the green square  
yeah we must  
and we possess less than two third that's two fifth of the market share in that area  
that doesn't doesn't really matter  
be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea  
uh also i think <unk> <unk> and martin <unk> should deserve at least i think offices with one person not with two  
'kay  
well we we uh  
just just okay 'cause i mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside  
our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat <unk>  
do you know what the um the sets of codes are  
yeah  
well what you'll need in the end is something operational  
if i get any more information of fruits and vegetables i'll let you know  
the younger market likes uh well the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material  
okay  
it's been so long  
about the casing we have three different casing possibilities  
alright  
no that wouldn't <unk> no  
i would suggest uh  
so now you say to us  
mm  
i got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the <unk> speech recognition into a into the coffee machine  
advanced chip  
i have to draw  
yeah okay so <unk> or pepper  
well uh uh that's what i i was  
yeah  
yeah  
oh the the it's not going to work uh people  
mm-hmm  
and  
we keep coming back to the fronts  
yeah i completely agree  
a and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet  
it's the other way around yeah  
and then sort of bring us all together into it to see <unk> see how this fits in with the overall vision  
um it's it's it's within budget um i it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue  
mm  
mm  
the other option is i don't know if you can see it but it's like if  
yes  
okay  
right um one question  
yeah  
but um it sounds like the kind of thing where you know  
you <unk> you just push it in for yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something and then yeah  
yeah but it has to be on to <unk> <unk>  
but  
but from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape  
and  
so i think overall we're headed in the right direction  
so we don't have to worry about commas  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
oh  
mm  
oh which lines  
so then it's like this or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this  
one thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector  
but that that covers all the all the other settings  
hey wow  
at least for children like one colour and  
okay  
yeah  
two three and what do you think  
uh i have a  
mm-hmm  
triple dash r. dash <unk> <unk> c.  
maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone  
and then the back end  
we have battery power we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor  
i don't know i just  
yeah that groups  
and uh it's possible  
okay  
at the moment we've just got the simple chip which costs one  
so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour  
mm-hmm  
okay  
hmm i can take mine it's okay voila mm so mm  
yeah  
yes i think th  
it's too long  
the frequencies  
yeah drag the mouse there  
seal a seal  
i there's something that i  
yeah  
<unk> no  
combine them  
okay  
of course there's an area which is common to both of them okay  
yeah <unk>  
so lots of choices what do we think  
with the charger  
okay  
uh it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company  
and something that might further complicate it is that the t. v. makes noise itself  
the feel  
maybe it's it needs to be <unk>  
i agree with having too many remotes around  
oh  
we uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system so we can might as well <unk> drop that  
uh though it has more functionality i think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually  
tomatoes  
or we could get that office for you and nancy and put <unk> and uh <unk> with maria and a visitor  
yeah  
and if it does do a lot that's a bonus but they don't care so much you know  
you should be able to pull out any interesting category and say alright for this phase it's t. r. one or c.  
i don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff  
right there you go  
well go back first of all and look at nite x. m. l. to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that which nite x. m. l. offers us  
i mean there are some but and not that i've read more than about two meetings  
yes  
um cats are sometimes very independent  
in  
right  
um <unk> after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra red bulb  
mm-hmm  
ne yes  
'cause um it's worth you guys knowing  
yeah  
well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite  
i think  
i have a clear picture  
i think unfortunately that's our best option  
okay so um i mean i won't get in touch with philosophy  
it's cool  
that's true  
thing extra  
with interchangeable covers could just buy a new one every year a new one when new fashions come out  
so maybe just a simple push button and that would cut costs on the  
yeah  
hmm  
why why you cannot  
so four  
four point four million  
like realistically looking at this from the the time we have left to do this and stuff  
i mean for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes  
'cause you know if well i mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a t. v. for each kid  
yeah  
yeah  
two  
yeah that's true  
now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas  
remote okay so  
it's uh a case of um  
um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to will use the consumer will use the actual device  
okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use  
usually the claim  
wow  
okay  
so if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works  
i <unk> because i in my presentation i don't have here with so it was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the <unk>  
<unk> what <unk> um the kinds of events that we had <unk> uh before talked about putting into the record for then use in elan and n. x. t. isn't based on saying every x. seconds something  
okay  
yeah  
that that might be the market that we're we're looking for  
and we <unk> oh gosh what were we gonna to do about a. and again  
mm-hmm  
because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the t. v. <unk> no longer have as well  
do you want to introduce yourself again  
because i <unk> uh i talked with herve and he said okay  
i think so you can just change  
because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know  
we also continued on with the ideas that <unk> following uh apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green  
everybody ready  
yeah yeah  
yeah you just do it like this  
and then i knew oh now the presentation is shifted  
yeah  
the potato  
my name is uh danny <unk>  
i think these are the the most important functions  
so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t. v. set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen  
okay  
uh oh  
but we haven't for the whole thing  
um  
so we'll <unk> it keep it with the functional design  
uh yeah at least like we can make banana or  
oh  
okay so when you i mean uh given that there are these events recorded  
yeah it's soft and it's that i like soft  
and different routes  
no  
that's fab guys  
this can go  
p. a. s.  
with the l. c. d. screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint and then you can use it again  
<unk>  
and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like <unk> and you could scroll through brightness and and <unk> and then you can you can <unk> the buttons and still have those  
it's an option  
yeah  
so the <unk> the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction  
you did it on only one  
they're just recording  
we're gonna make a new remote control that's um original trendy and also user friendly  
you mean <unk>  
it's below the <unk>  
yeah uh there are different uh we have all have different home pages with different links  
um relevance of two  
basically i have some issues which you discussed earlier  
like um i'm thinking of i i've used this example before  
yeah  
okay um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting we reviewed the previous minutes before that um each of you made your presentations  
yeah  
so to find something for that  
yeah  
things but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well  
well yeah  
hmm  
oh okay  
oh  
yeah yeah  
it's an idea with the buttons being really  
to go one step back you it's only two extra buttons but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen  
alright  
yeah  
and you're <unk> <unk> r. e. i. s. s.  
don't wanna lose all my mikes plugged in here  
yeah that's uh  
hmm  
yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped so that's uh but perhaps that's a good thing so that's easy to use  
yeah that's great  
uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense  
um  
th that would be on one side uh-huh  
when they say <unk> you know some people when they swallow up the the last bit  
i mean the sponge like and the three d. shape that would give it something young and fresh  
good job i got pockets today  
yeah yeah  
so the batteries i'll start with the battery right  
so it's different direction which we are <unk> using  
so one of the formats in which eye tracker data is <unk> is percentage of time spent on some target as opposed to some competitor over the first second after some event  
huh  
i will do so after every meeting so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there  
then we still yeah we need something else maybe to make it kind of special because that was our our special feature  
so even if you don't want to <unk> a speech fully at least um you need yeah  
well not spend but you know charge twenty five euro  
market expert  
i see  
uh you know we have a bunch of options from wood titanium rubber plastic whatnot  
yeah it's okay  
yeah yeah  
right you too  
mm-hmm  
we'll uh  
ah 'kay  
it is in three step as you know  
so what about technology  
but other than that we got the red apple  
oh  
um so you can uh their pattern is uh not uh the same uh depending on the direction where the person is  
so you can use a pen  
but  
first of all our project aim  
no  
just a week ago a keyboard manufacturer would print with and uh  
i think the top is more uh  
<unk>  
when it falls over it and i just have and then the button that i use most has to be here  
it doesn't look like a banana at all  
so the physical uh aspect of it  
okay  
so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the t. v. itself  
gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there  
okay  
how how tall do you envisage it being  
mm  
yeah i'm from san diego as well  
so why why if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we  
well i dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing  
yeah great  
are you gonna lose it easier  
what about lighting adaptive options  
um seventy five <unk> seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly  
yeah yeah i'm uh hurrying  
yeah  
okay  
so i've just thought yeah i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go  
okay  
but in this case you you have to use uh the label one yeah  
okay  
like the ipod  
so regular chip  
although we are demolishing a little bit the style  
yeah they'd love that kind of stuff  
so next please  
mm  
so yeah  
yeah you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market  
<unk> also look cool  
we just <unk> we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it  
yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this  
so with this additional little we might be having slightly better market for us  
yeah  
wow  
um i had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design  
a <unk> a rabbit oh oh yeah where is the carrot  
yeah well uh <unk> different screen settings a yeah <unk> yeah <unk> you you you you have screen width  
who happens to be your friend  
so i mean this this might be a good case for or it might uh or it might be that you should just like you know  
user friendly and original so um i think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned  
okay  
okay  
and uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on  
some televisions don't accept uh that that  
but there is a the back end <unk> which i will give you which is turn around of eighteen minutes or well from eleven to fifteen minutes  
mm-hmm  
right okay  
radio <unk>  
uh what did you wanna get through today more  
okay  
yeah so the target price is for all europe or only for rich countries  
yeah  
and you say you think you're able as well to map onto those segments  
mm-hmm  
i by the way i read a paper which makes an important point about combining two things of that type  
i don't think it's really bad either  
could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it  
yeah it wouldn't be a problem  
okay  
oh i see what you mean i like it comes from adding two different things together  
my name is mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off  
yeah  
that counts  
is it going to have a charger or is it going to be run strictly off batteries  
which uh whether or not that's a good or a bad thing  
and that you can make them curved or double curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look  
i is is probably you know no more than minutes in its entire life  
you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company  
it's single curved  
yes you should you should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work  
so who would like to go first  
yeah  
like unless someone's making noise right outside the door it really is fairly quiet  
i don't oh  
so it's quite good  
so we don't really know what happens afterwards  
so it will <unk> on the mirror  
out dated  
conclusion  
yeah it's like an <unk> but this is for children  
so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana  
four thousand g. b. <unk>  
well yes  
yeah  
no i'm so i i i think i <unk> uh i i get it  
that i would believe  
we have to test  
guess  
mm  
okay  
oh and that's old town  
i guess so  
i don't say it's specially mm  
um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably l. c. d. and if there's enough money speech recognition  
six  
yeah  
okay  
ye  
and there is uh a lot of <unk> now about this implementation  
two  
'cause the penn tree bank parsers are pretty minimal because they didn't wanna commit to a specific grammatical theory  
oh here you can you can view  
yeah yeah  
uh no no no no i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh <unk> batteries in in the yeah into the <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
this this is just this is just for like the look  
perhaps um  
no <unk> on the on the front  
okay  
it fell  
yeah but i think the re the remote control if you press tap the screen  
um where we have a moving band the graphical display that also moves according to the  
<unk>  
uh it depends on the okay  
mm-hmm  
just keep h. beta i think  
so it's nine nine over three  
anyway  
he only has to figure out how it has to look  
yeah  
yeah okay  
yeah  
um  
okay  
right  
yeah <unk>  
mm  
i like  
we don't know if it's th it if it's okay  
like you know you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment  
yeah  
but not quite sure i mean is there anything more we have to talk about anyway  
yeah in circle you know  
but the these are all quite fancy features i'm not sure whether  
uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim i think  
channel volume selection present  
but like at first it's just gonna be i. d. f.  
right  
yeah  
<unk> maybe two  
so is this uh an indian or an african elephant 'cause you haven't drawn the ears  
you'd need the usual ones like the changing the volume changing the the channel and then you uh today we have uh um teletext and all those things  
well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing  
yeah  
this one  
because the l. c. d. has more support on customer side  
alright  
mm-hmm  
that's a process though  
yeah  
yeah okay go ahead  
okay  
yeah yeah  
so it's somewhere three point five i think  
and then wait uh two uh seconds or something  
come on  
no we cannot do  
yeah  
do you  
but we don't have time to market  
yeah okay but i have to design the  
'cause it's not linguistic  
so it doesn't it's pretty the prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the  
i don't think so  
even though they cost a little more  
and that has to do with the camera settings so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras  
right  
mm  
i wonder  
well the the the the doesn't really list part in the in the g. d. f.  
good point  
also on the internet  
whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see  
yeah i think that's probably right as well  
yeah  
well i can imagine kind of like j. peg operations  
if it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button  
they're probably one fifty each or something like that  
don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff  
yeah yeah  
so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in which adds to the cost as you can expect  
it's a <unk> feature  
well it's not the most difficult right  
functional design meeting  
you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you  
right  
probably one point zero is very high information value  
mm  
ah okay so this is not the one that has been uh  
on the t. v. screen  
and there's only a  
i don't know  
oh well done yeah yeah oh <unk>  
this is just a  
a little little box you can attach to your t. v. is fine then okay  
well he must some these days anyway isn't it  
uh but uh i'm sure it's fine 'cause um it's just my memory of things  
yeah okay you <unk> um  
mm  
um i dunno i've never bought a remote control so i don't know how how good a remote control that would get you  
i mean i do see the cross over in some sense but but but but with the the remote is is used for television okay  
um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier  
it's hot on the streets guys  
yeah it's it's expensive but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
we have to sum up everything  
yeah  
oh sorry  
last  
so  
on the and on the  
right because the whole way like the whole beauty of the nite x. m. l. is that it ties together lots of different files  
it could easily  
what we actually get to do we'll see later when we have the stuff  
alright  
okay understand  
right  
think  
um we've got uh  
okay  
as you can see  
i mean how fashionable can you make a remote  
administration is close to the professors offices so it's easier for the secretary to speak to everyone  
damped lyman alpha data  
mm-hmm  
but i don't see a detector over there  
and they should be bigger in size  
so first they need to extract the information from the document which is not does not seem to be so trivial  
i like mangoes  
such as channel and volume  
yep  
it's there  
so it should be replaced by  
um so yeah um okay  
okay  
but then  
um  
because it they were it has to be for a t. v. just to keep myself  
i'm sure i can figure out some way to do it anyway  
i didn't have a phone 'til university  
so you know susan insisted that uh  
yeah  
where is it  
there's the scroll wheel in or out  
let's say that it makes uh less automatic in the sense that at point you need someone giving the file and putting the file <unk> in somewhere et cetera  
right  
i am the um i need my notebook mm ooh top banana  
it's play doh  
and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now  
towards the equipment you wanna control with it right  
i've had a look at the <unk> which has given us um some <unk> inspiration from previous products  
<unk> uh reaction product  
the l. c. d. panel just displays um functionally what you're doing  
i mean you can also think about the sort of joint problem solving kinds of um approaches  
well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside i'm not sure really how complicated our um  
um  
one one little question  
uh-huh  
um  
no uh it it it uh it is uh  
but but your category thing depends on that we not just have topic segments but also that these topic segments we have them in categories  
<unk>  
people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh <unk> a question which will we have to see later  
ah  
'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually  
see if there if there's even interest out there  
yeah <unk> no no you can push this one but we don't have a <unk> uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this <unk> thing  
well  
hmm  
<unk> yes  
okay  
there's plenty of space  
okay  
so that uh then what we look <unk> yeah  
um i'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it  
mm  
and it's like a news site uh for geeks and you have uh nerds yeah  
uh well that's all i have to say i think  
well then we have still the time so but we do have to come to a decision right later on  
that was the crank wind up crank on the side  
yeah  
anything you want  
mm  
yeah  
th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh <unk> <unk> no it's the first one  
it it <unk> yeah it i mean uh as long as we're <unk> <unk> yeah it there shouldn't be anything missing  
uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda <unk> to the to the shape of your hand  
and martin is fifty per cent  
mm  
mm-hmm  
so you know things that to start everything going  
no  
no but for this one it's twelve euro  
and then also there's the idea of the base  
double curved yes  
yeah  
christa christa  
no  
thin i think we should work  
um try second one maybe  
do we need uh many buttons or do we need <unk> many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to <unk> which appliances are on or not  
if you leave your telly on standby it powers blackpool for a certain amount of time  
banana <unk> yeah  
it was a bit interesting lot of arguments and  
it's because um rainbow is a text classification system  
like a <unk> like a compass point you know just up  
just made a load of money  
okay just thought i'd ask  
or or you could just point to you know have <unk> great big arrow that points at the two pieces that broke  
where the engineering ones the boxes tend to make it look more complicated than it really is  
i compare those two like the p. l. s. a. and the one over this same task of assigning good directory  
okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment  
means on the remote  
there's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that <unk>  
yeah <unk> an option yes  
sorry didn't get that  
ah  
if the order is in uh is is uh important that's the word for  
oh  
it's sorry it's a bit  
but we believe  
now who are recording this meeting  
uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with  
true  
and there's also a  
yeah  
mm  
we could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so because this year is all fruit god only knows why  
yeah  
<unk> uh  
okay so <unk> what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote right  
yeah  
there could be a little microphone on it  
two years  
yeah  
um so let's try the <unk>  
nice sentence  
yeah yeah  
not the case  
yeah  
alright  
yes it's for the  
but um yeah maybe that's  
no not totally  
well that was the idea i believe but um  
smart board  
so number of <unk>  
we have a big financial problem  
yeah but there are no negative questions i guess  
i'm sure that something like an l. c. d. screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem  
so first i wanna ask the  
it's yeah  
is it is it robust  
ah it's  
what's that you discussed for today though  
i think i don't have <unk>  
but those are plastic right  
okay cool  
um and especially if we are um trying to be trendy go with fashions things like that  
no  
yeah  
you can clap  
yeah  
or if we should have a targeted re remote control  
battery and kinetic  
i know  
like for example for the display if you actually if you want a display uh like for the whole series  
i i didn't try to  
okay  
is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra i wan i want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device  
we're just at twelve fifty euros  
eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy  
yeah okay  
yeah <unk>  
we we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting  
it's alright  
did i save this one  
it'll be more the on the numbers and the volume  
couldn't we couldn't we just um take the um a name each um each dialogue act um meeting dot um dialogue act number  
oh i thought we all were  
that's right that's right  
oh covers yeah  
mm  
i really can change it so  
it should be whatever will be the case the chip is always going to be sitting inside  
yeah  
li okay  
maybe you could explore the two option  
well now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there  
i guess the channel that you're on the <unk> the volume setting  
uh so  
yeah it uh that's true  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
you know you know what i'm saying like for whom is this intended  
uh they will say it's splendid  
yeah  
no  
this one um this is the user <unk> it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering <unk>  
i mean they record what you're writing and then what do you do with it  
yeah you can choose the code  
the that's that should not the problem  
so  
beautiful  
right and then that that <unk> triggers the  
yep  
um now  
well i don't know i mean if you can like well i don't know if there's just a way of leaving them out  
mm  
uh leadership  
so we put a touch pad on it and say ha ha  
okay  
but isn't idea to use uh uh what you said uh normal on and off button for the t. v. that you don't have to use a  
and uh the buttons  
mm-hmm  
yep  
well but the but the mute yeah the <unk> is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute right  
yeah  
alright  
so i think in general and also for the sake of the lecturers  
we want to erase it  
so the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes it can  
yeah  
uh  
uh again the push buttons i i see are are everywhere  
yeah  
we have a number of different choices for a design concept um and <unk> that's that's something that that i'll show you some examples of um  
<unk> underwater uh yeah  
okay  
we can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired  
okay  
okay mute button  
too sorry so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious  
<unk> this is supposed to be only for m. f. c. c. <unk> and these easy features ah one question i i wanted to ask before  
yeah but i think when you are holding it you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus  
yes unfortunately  
well i'm not i'm not sure i see the point actually  
so we actually have the l. c. d. display  
should we by the way draw um  
so it depend on how <unk> do you define fancy  
but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller it's it's also the issue of the t. v.  
well we were finding out various things in  
okay yeah yeah  
ye okay  
not very balanced  
twelve euros and fifty cents  
what are you doing chief  
uh-huh  
right yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
mm yeah  
um  
that's only if things haven't been getting through  
yeah  
cool  
the l. c. d.  
we can make a <unk> a logo  
that's an option  
there we are  
really we'd have to use something to show you but  
so maybe like it can be uh something like in a meeting it can be like an unusual scenario for you in a presentation with a slide  
yeah  
where there has scroll down functions on the side  
<unk> okay  
why uh why not a seven  
right i'm gonna take minutes while um you guys express your favourite animals  
well then uh then i'll go for four  
yeah well let's assume it is  
does this does this bear in mind that i mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us  
that's right  
ah okay  
okay  
red and yellow  
it's uh something the user then uh identify with  
but now i see the  
yeah so a a point better for the for the number two  
oh that would be brilliant  
oh yeah yeah that's true  
okay  
yeah you're right  
yeah  
with parts  
yeah but then the que the que the question is there a licence for <unk> where you just need one editing <unk> thing and two recording things  
yeah okay  
yeah  
yeah  
a source type  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh my name's bob <unk>  
um  
um we want it to be something original  
so for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the <unk> on the side  
distinction  
yeah  
i dunno  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah yeah framing it's like it's really yeah  
can we get started or is there some pressing issue  
uh-huh  
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros  
otherwise we can go onto our system and get it  
well don't forget well don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are <unk> <unk> who are <unk> yeah <unk> <unk>  
the first time i've ever done anything like yeah project project management  
<unk> <unk> would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit  
well should we start with just the core the basic functions that we need  
yeah  
yeah  
oh sorry you can indeed  
they're selling these things everywhere  
also this warping and <unk> and all these things  
either refresh it or it <unk> oh wait maybe i didn't put it there  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh but  
i don't know uh too expensive  
what we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting  
and that implies that there's only one t. v. user  
one being true  
oh  
yay  
keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there you get it yours without that one and then you get it with both  
mm-hmm  
it's an interesting task  
no it's it's not very cheap but that no but it's a development inside corporation  
yeah  
they have to sell at least four million to make a profit  
ho how do you generate the real media yeah  
see i'm  
mm-hmm  
uh  
no you're  
oops  
suppose  
there is another one  
uh-huh  
yeah  
maximum thirty six  
no  
um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels  
um i'm not sure if there's any other examples of that but something to look out for  
i think we should stick on very useful functions because we want less button  
that's true  
uh do you th i think that goes out  
he does have body uh  
yeah  
uh at home we have a t. v. a video uh recorder a d. v. d. player and a satellite receiver  
yeah she's got it  
and and it's a you know for the the cowboy in all of us i i'm not quite sure what the the function is there but  
yeah  
um  
so we have more slides or  
as he models the  
and it will be difficult for the vocabulary also  
so you have one piece you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t. v. and the other  
bye  
<unk> with a button to  
marketing  
we better make we better make it like this  
mm-hmm  
and if you have um if you have a <unk> word you don't need to use the hyphen to mark discontinuity  
okay  
okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape  
those kind of things uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your v. v. c. r. <unk>  
we can also consider directional microphones  
okay  
uh no we haven't not  
yeah  
the price  
it's a cute elephant  
um more <unk> more more decisions we made  
you can just if you ma finish my presentation please  
mm-hmm  
so that's not really that  
um along side the conference is possibly one way of maintaining interest and  
once you've got the whole voice chip in there then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit  
otherwise could you just describe  
these buttons i don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote  
so if you want to have a look at it you know where to find it  
what i found is we want to do fashion and i think honestly we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design  
yeah the  
so just to show dave has put a uh music file in there and the music file is playing without gaps  
i think you probably should then 'cause we will put in our align strength  
okay  
'cause we uh really don't know each other and uh it's kinda new  
mm-hmm  
i dunno  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
so um 'cause yeah  
so that's that  
so but your p. l. p. is also like  
okay  
yeah i don't know how we incorporate  
um  
um if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room  
mm-hmm  
pops up the options  
so you have to decide whether you you know you want to be going so fast or not  
'kay  
okay  
i i think you <unk> might wanna put it uh yeah that it it it it stands up  
mm-hmm  
th yeah th those are  
power channel volume number keys possibly a speech recognition  
these are the three things and there are different materials with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve  
oh okay  
can you uh change channels directly with with just one button  
oh yeah  
so so what did you have more on later slides about this  
no it took a battery  
but um yeah but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay  
i think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about  
uh what's this  
i don't have any details to when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference  
uh they're a ha they're at yeah <unk> that's the word i saw  
well no  
yeah we need to add some sanity checking in some of the stuff  
yeah yeah yeah  
but um by this i think it's more a case of fruit and <unk>  
oh right so  
just so like you wanna uh back view  
right  
right  
yeah that's that's true but but it has to be a little big solid  
hmm  
i'll draw a penguin  
so the customer basically is confused  
are you missing the sound  
you could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem  
each number is transparent  
okay  
and so for this product it's gonna be television only and then it has to have the uh logos  
ah okay  
we don't want people coming in seeing this lavish reading room and and and everyone having their own office if that's not what we are having in the other places  
it has to be g. d. f.  
um  
no  
uh rubber  
but that could be quite difficult  
right  
so i arrived uh in june something like that a couple of month ago  
actually i don't know what are the <unk> the real specification of a of a universal remote <unk>  
okay  
for people who uh sketch th the whole day i can imagine that it's useful  
then i don't know  
imagine it would be inside  
possibly meaning that the l. c. d. wouldn't be in this perfect place  
i have no ooh that i wasn't gonna say  
true but it didn't even occur to me as an option i mean i don't know that i would have but i know that i consciously didn't  
or <unk> does what it does you know can it make you coffee  
mm  
um  
and i hope our project group will not be slow but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can  
it has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society  
does anyone know any good standards software displays x. m. l. i'm not sure  
mm-hmm  
first um they say that's uh about something about <unk> teletext  
um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance  
in document  
um yeah  
so um obviously  
well i had a few uh things in mind  
just looking at the screen and uh  
well we sort of  
so which number are we going to fill in  
well of course we're new to each other so i'd like to get acquainted first  
already  
you could allow him to <unk> to watch this type of interface and he would be able to do the selection  
you're not gonna find them  
microphones  
would we mark it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
first don't touch that things  
it probably became addicted to the fumes  
that's right  
do you not think it might need  
mm  
and just like at least for the for sort of for finding topics titles for for segments  
i don't know if it's already sent or not  
yes that seems right  
no it's not in here  
or just messed it up  
um and third thirdly the <unk> of use is is the um is is important as well  
yeah  
so if you see escape you know that it should be the same  
okay  
the command inter  
you know you  
because it would block us two full working places  
yeah this is a this bit uh difficulty in i didn't take a major in art  
even if i l. e. d. uh or a if if it's the l. c. d. feature uh whatever yeah  
if if if what if one if one person's trying to get a part to a part that isn't that that so the part that's just sitting on the screen that's not being touched  
mm um we put the fashion in electronics  
so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um  
so we are looking for something that looks good and just works rather than looking for any special features  
okay  
oh good morning everyone  
just every <unk> yeah everything to do with this has to be <unk>  
well that's that's one to raise at the meeting  
i think that's what that is  
uh harmonics and the  
uh what the buttons were uh they use most how much an hour and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons  
isn't it the pitch and the frequency  
that's for buttons  
and i'm probably not  
hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so we are agree with a small  
i will try  
so that would solve the problems with the t. v. kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels  
well yeah i mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good  
nice  
yeah  
sorry  
the marks  
oh yeah  
uh  
a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access  
lame or  
mm mm mm  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
and a script that sets the class path so it can be run with just a script  
yeah  
you always have a print plate right  
um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions um we didn't actually go through and specify the  
yeah yeah  
real reaction remotes control  
yeah  
uh teamwork  
yeah  
exactly yeah  
like that we know the <unk> working  
yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting but i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required  
mm  
and the application you are using all of them uh <unk> every time you are using <unk> or you are programming everything is based based on <unk>  
should it just  
um what i because nine mega byte is what i got for when i said for every um utterance this is goes from there to there and  
yeah  
yeah  
'cause he looks like the uh the the lion from the lion king  
yes  
okay yeah it's fine  
yeah  
mm  
okay  
ye  
well um according to <unk> um people do not use um all the extra features very very often  
yeah  
yeah  
sound signal  
yeah okay  
and we rough estimated very quickly  
where you have volume up and volume down but they have a v. on both of them so uh  
it's compared to the all  
so we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over  
but we i we will need a receiver an antenna  
what an original idea  
so we start with a table that is <unk> the tab uh of the table where we are now  
so next year people will be buying i found this really funny you know strawberry shaped chairs  
so <unk> when the user presses a button it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal  
three three  
with the stop words okay th there would be a reason for uh in independence because there is uh such a huge mess of them  
so if they if they uh they had a fixation on c. you wouldn't be worried  
good  
definitely 'cause i'm thinking in terms of um uh  
uh i've i will also take notes during this meeting and i will send you uh a summary then as usual  
else you you get problems with the l. c. d.  
mm-hmm  
this one on the one side and one yeah  
<unk> <unk> <unk> you have <unk> five slices like <unk> across that way i guess  
um that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it  
so yeah  
yeah  
and then below is the l. c. d. screen  
no  
alright then  
yeah  
but  
<unk> quite it's quite easy we do that <unk> with back light on the on the wheel  
mm  
fits into uh eight euros actually right seven eight euros  
no  
yeah yeah maybe  
you mean to the tags of the data <unk> within it  
right  
yes  
mm  
right  
purple  
you you have it a bit uh yeah  
that's  
it's it's so handy  
um that yeah  
but we have got the index um for converting from <unk> i. d. <unk> to to yours  
i know that they do that for alarm clock also  
twelve point five is the profit on one  
yeah fair enough  
yeah  
uh it it won't take a lot of batteries  
it's the um the way you do the analysis  
yeah  
but you can tell what they're about based on the other texts on the site  
so  
yellow is uh our company colour uh red it's uh is more attractive  
radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah  
mm  
so just in time  
yeah we are a real fashionable company  
well in a sense  
a nice jolly little baby  
need more time and  
yeah thank you  
yes  
right  
it can be you that basically follow advise helps  
yeah  
<unk> <unk>  
yeah  
yeah something like this yeah  
content and form  
right  
i mean you say this is a card  
yeah well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what <unk> what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step  
um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little  
included these days  
for real reaction  
forty five  
yeah uh but um so whatever you <unk> whatever you get hands on from les atlas uh for over past five years uh <unk> this two years ago  
to the past requirements  
hmm  
if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh <unk> uh to be shown at the same time  
yeah  
hmm  
or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits  
that's right  
no uh we have fifteen and oh right  
i think we did two training sets and then we had at least one meeting with you where we talked it all through  
could could i see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut  
ten  
a scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip which is a higher price range  
you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy <unk> thing  
yeah  
it's uh yeah right  
they say they could put it to work but um we don't think so  
so it's r. t. s. p. the connection and i it's streaming video streaming so it's not h. t. t. p.  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
think it will  
and um i don't have any conclusion i didn't have time the meeting was very tight so that's basically my findings  
<unk> um all the words together um for all the meetings  
uh if i remember  
um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on  
i don't think you should dump the l. c. d. screen  
back and okay  
well that's one of the big problems with l. p. c. ten for instance  
is that one of the  
and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often only as and when required  
yeah yeah  
it now if we're <unk>  
i still don't like it  
but that was but that's all  
i think there's just one button so handy  
hmm  
every um sequence of the same topic  
anything <unk> i di i didn't mark  
yeah that's right  
<unk> right  
and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work  
we're <unk> bursting with creativity  
that's it  
yeah  
i've  
mm-hmm  
well i'll <unk> i no no yeah i'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down  
mm  
yes but we we have to design much more because there was some irritating account manager coming to me  
it's not the trend  
but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the v. c. r. and if you want to follow the uh <unk> uh <unk> some uh soundtrack on the <unk> <unk> see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh  
all all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control you won't know what they're working for  
you have anything to share  
yeah one  
so give them the seventh yeah  
my goodness  
the joystick would be in the right place  
then then you would like to for example what <unk> what could be very simple would be just to then to match each pages like that  
poster session was introduced in nineteen ninety nine as part of the main conference  
i mean what would  
evaluation ready  
yeah  
and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching  
that's <unk>  
gosh we're getting through this now  
hmm  
no you try to keep it as true to what's being said  
curves being  
yeah  
uh screen on top of it it i it isn't vulnerable  
okay so let let me draw the body first  
yeah  
i it's an option  
the where th where they're they're not so much looking at the algorithm  
yeah but i think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really  
so then <unk> we wouldn't have to have like a dual function  
mm-hmm  
so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people but also somewhat on the elderly people  
but if <unk> if you would put it at a different place then you have to move your hands and that's on of the things about r. s. i.  
what about the digital pens did you find them easy enough to use  
which is the you know what else is he holding you up from  
a chat would also be uh  
yeah  
it's it's sort of it's overrunning the <unk> like it so okay so at the moment we're that far that if i now click onto a segment hits  
yeah go ahead  
just  
yeah  
oh yeah  
yeah i know  
alright  
be robust  
that's fine  
that we people use our remote with  
and we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you  
so <unk> we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale one being uh no i think  
the i. d. is going to work on the components concept um u. i. d. the user interface concept and you're going to do some trend watching  
uh until we get twelve fifty  
if you press the <unk> one and then the two it be between five <unk> it make twelve and that's that's not relaxed  
so one thing that would be very helpful for me because i haven't read i think we're in a situation where jean you know  
yeah  
so it's good  
i don't think well yeah i don't think he would but in a sense  
you just need the <unk>  
we could just start with the assumption that's only for t. v. and video  
it's it's more like a fly hovering  
and in in the science it's not that easy to to break  
okay  
so go through all the channels and do that and then um then you should have the context from all four speakers  
we've got it all written down  
just because we really are critically interested in the argument um that the group is building up so that we can find the decisions that they made and um any <unk> uh counter proposals to proposals that have been made and things  
it may not be exact every time but it's a so sort of size we're looking for  
no no no  
yeah  
and we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions  
okay  
we should should go back to the beginning  
uh i just forgot to save this  
and it's pretty straight forward you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the l. c. d. menus  
oh so that's good anyway then yeah  
oh  
but the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable when you get off the front  
so how can we  
mm-hmm  
and i you can also bring your your your note block  
so i don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a <unk> problem  
yeah yeah  
so that shouldn't be marked  
but i don't think a l. c. d. display fits in that image  
something that should be addressed later  
yeah  
so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger  
okay  
no  
so not not too much but yeah  
so i think if we're going to go well i mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the t. f. t. or the l. c. d. kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of  
no i understand  
um  
no it it is up to you know  
and then it would be easy to then go back when if we have the time marks here  
slim  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
yeah alternate energy source like win wind power or  
because the shots are very short in advertising usually it's uh very fast and so sometimes  
so we what's so yeah so could you please tell me little bit more in detail  
an <unk> you could make another step of doing a search using um going under the edit menu you can  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
yep okay  
'kay  
is the  
mm  
yeah  
mm  
yeah i mean you're famous  
yeah  
yeah  
maybe no  
um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible  
or or under each option you set a you set an a screen thing what says back  
no that's yours  
yeah  
yeah that's true that's true  
so  
no  
what before we were gonna use <unk> at all what well what we were gonna do what were we going to do with the sound  
yeah  
okay so we put the batteries here  
and then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work  
but make it just like shiny  
but if i have triangles one two three right and i throw them away any triangles i take out are to replace one two three  
uh  
user requirements specifications  
hold hold fire  
yeah  
so those two tied together have each word and its time and  
hmm  
yeah  
uh do you mean it like  
yeah you could maybe take out the l. c. d. dis display even if it if it comes up on the computer <unk> on the t. v. itself  
so um for this first part here power wise have we got battery  
does that mean like a wind up one  
and then uh make it i would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance  
um so i've looked at some of the stuff i was sent um try and get some inspiration  
you can adjust the angle to which it flips  
solar cells  
and he may ask for special services or uh and even to just to watch the movie to have direct access to different parts and so on  
yeah  
really need to wrap up now  
mm  
uh  
we could check the other remote controls with technical functions  
um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing  
do you want me to check that  
it's  
that's yeah  
so but for numbers i think it may be okay numbers hardly yeah  
uh yeah the basic functions  
um but what <unk>  
this is to do this i will not remove my microphone  
no i ideally you're correct uh but  
and you  
so it would that would give us a totally different design  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so i really open this up to uh any other feedback  
<unk> there we go  
but i think in for example like t. v. guides i think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything  
yeah  
if you right click and then go onto a previous slide  
okay  
but we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad  
hey it's back to the original  
yep right  
'kay that's we're not doing so badly  
single nee single curved  
i i think uh  
yeah that's not you  
hmm  
i would have to tag uh some part of it or something  
point twelve  
i think yeah  
yeah okay  
press one button uh acting as a a enter button  
so instead of speaker  
require lot of requirements but  
r. <unk> r. three c.  
yeah that's a good idea  
yeah it yeah  
then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something  
uh  
anything you wanna add for personal preferences though you <unk> you said already that we needed a large on off button you think  
so if so something like their skipping would it actually corporate with our system at the moment  
mm-hmm  
no it wasn't wasn't <unk> it was possible not allowed so  
yeah right  
mm-hmm  
but those are the definitely the top ones  
and basically <unk> we just need something that really i mean there's some other points up there but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple  
mm  
and this you should be able to evaluate then  
um  
okay  
should be just loading  
mm-hmm  
that does get annoying  
but there is already something that people have started to put on the market and so on  
'kay  
so yeah that's quite easy because it's it's an attribute and you just <unk> say that you want the values of those attributes  
ah  
we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work  
'cause at the moment uh you know it's it's hard  
uh th nobody  
mark  
<unk> qualitative uh presentation  
or  
and then you're gonna bung it on the other <unk> track too if you need it right  
i mean if we think of something like i was saying also lime and lemon you know  
there will be this  
right  
uh okay  
one  
you have uh redundancy  
<unk>  
it does scroll but it is hugely complicated  
now  
<unk> tenth of a second no matter how long you press it for i don't know i don't actually know  
we certainly are mm  
mm  
okay  
okay something longer window than the one we are speaking about okay  
okay  
yeah  
and uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance the third point is a high ease of use  
isn't that technical functions  
'kay  
yep  
the <unk> also  
we can have a look at those ideas yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah but i mean what is meant by special colour  
i think you should  
i'm marketing  
we need some kinda of power <unk> power source  
i'm not quite sure how it  
so yeah that's uh that's it  
yeah whistle  
is that acceptable  
good  
mm-hmm  
meet  
prepare and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the <unk> yes  
no uh yes  
um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote  
that's the way round  
it's it's speech synthesis and <unk> it's speech kind of not really speech recognition but kind of pattern matching yeah yeah  
okay  
mm  
so  
i think that's good  
which has a lot more buttons and probably this is one that people complain about about having too many buttons that you don't use  
so maybe it'd be  
right  
<unk> yeah push buttons  
yeah i will try i'll try  
this is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people which are um the younger people were defined under forty  
mm-hmm  
are they big enough to get anything meaningful out of  
in in another colour  
uh speech recognition i think so we need a microphone presumably  
so  
yeah ho  
yeah  
so we get to how many buttons have we got  
guess we're through then  
so i think we need also digits  
there's like no reason why it wouldn't work right  
true  
well the problem is this in with this application  
sure sure  
oh yeah  
yeah  
here that  
they do  
yeah  
the triple r. c. yeah  
yes little <unk> littler uh little products go deeper in it  
mm  
so if we want to <unk> if we have a big  
yeah  
i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be but i think he does have a point  
uh i was still working on stuff i hadn't got it finished  
yeah  
yes  
but it would be nice  
yeah  
yeah  
so um  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i  
so  
so like other than just making it look good  
okay  
alright  
should just not touch it  
yeah  
okay um we have a financial aspect to this project  
the uh the um below  
um <unk> one's bad and seven's the best  
so i received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit  
it's called the millennium remote control  
do come up  
yeah  
yeah  
so um  
the waiting is for sebastian  
um no but as long as they're solid <unk> it should be alright  
but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one  
right  
do you wanna give me the little cable thing  
mm  
no  
so uh  
because the the ami <unk> not very reliable for getting these sound files <unk>  
mm-hmm  
but yeah we need to do something to ensure that the search result is in the summary that's created  
is easiest to implement uh for the production 'cause they they can print it better  
mm anything uh i think which is not more  
yeah  
okay  
that's the coolest ant ever  
it's in the database itself  
this soft material thing from uh yeah  
so um does that make sense  
no i had many topics  
uh yeah yeah  
everybody's ready  
like the yeah because i worked in a industry for like a small time  
okay it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive but we have a simple chip single curve  
a purely secure directory we <unk> we we put a co code number like uh so that it's quite impossible to guess instead of video <unk> uh name equals kayak then we would have uh zero six seven uh five or  
i know  
um the industrial design <unk> will be doing um the working design  
yeah  
uh we really don't have any way around the t. a. one one eight three five  
okay  
alright  
okay  
until january is uh is busy  
exactly  
you can get a. g. n. without emission lines  
you can do yeah you can generate call outs and whatever  
people like spongy material  
but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on  
yes that's curved  
okay it <unk> gone through to you  
but uh keep in mind the new functions of t. v. what we discussed earlier split screen and uh is that a function that you should have  
together indeed uh because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use what you were already mentioning  
mm-hmm  
they're just such odd creatures you know  
um  
but you want zero to be mis aligned with the rest  
it's very important  
uh reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting  
so you <unk> you basically we have to we have to have two code versions then  
and <unk> also  
yeah  
okay  
and we looked at uh several um things  
yes rubber  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so that's the best idea the <unk> that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here  
i do as i once he's read a couple more i mean he's just completely missed out the collaborative problem solving world  
cool  
yep  
no but if you get <unk> on the remote you'd be able to  
so i have to re do the meetings from the minutes from the last meeting  
mm  
um  
it's not quite uh ergonomic  
yeah  
okay  
so we need to close this meeting yeah bravo  
so i the l. p. c. part was like i had to do it in one hour  
um yeah <unk> would it be best  
or volume up volume down brightness contrast  
i dunno  
yes  
uh it is yes of course  
on <unk>  
'cause people like that  
okay like transition something that is okay  
to make uh uh a new remote control for television  
yeah so i started looking at uh google page rank which kinda does this by saying well  
but do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now  
yeah we could yeah even put  
uh okay  
philosophy  
uh will change adapt and um so we will see that  
yeah  
yeah  
so still we would be able to start doing some recordings and maybe uh doing even the automatic alignment or at least we would have an idea about  
no significant difference  
after two minutes yeah two three minutes yeah  
one two three  
okay  
yeah  
uh put this down  
they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with  
it brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it  
but yeah  
mm  
oh you don't  
okay  
maybe not even pointed  
th in that way we have like only the numbers the power button skip and volume and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah mute  
okay so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case  
yeah  
'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and  
yeah it's tells you even which words it is  
i'd say number one  
when we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information  
yeah  
oh i uh didn't read that  
yep  
yes okay  
blah blah blah blah  
mm-hmm  
oh a squirrel  
it's your job oh  
it's actually the week that you were planning on  
um it's cur it's double curved so its curved all around  
and you might be uh you might be target customer  
really  
you can navigate on t. v. screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the t. v. connected to internet so we end in order to access the t. v. <unk> by x. m. l. and we need some to do some <unk>  
mm-hmm  
so this yeah so this is the described use what  
i think so  
it's a very big rat  
even those kind of questions you need some kind of mark up like this  
mm-hmm  
course he's sitting on the next desk  
cover  
yes  
yeah  
so but i think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target  
mm-hmm  
uh no  
<unk> has some reasons for doing it  
yeah  
so  
but we have to do it at this moment after th this meeting  
the problem was that there are two <unk> records  
i grew up in san diego but yeah um la <unk> p. b.  
uh where is my mouse  
yeah but  
okay  
yep it's unrelated  
yeah  
yeah just a the plain remotes not not specific l. c. d. remotes  
but uh for the prototype of this isn't this is not the the way we implement it now  
yeah  
sure  
you you can make very <unk> you can put very detailed functions regarding the t. v. set on your remote control uh with the with uh the  
fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days so  
mm  
yeah that's fine  
that's the point  
it's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice but then i don't th i dunno  
now i was sent a couple of  
well that's about twenty per cent i thought  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah something  
yeah  
yeah  
uh the text  
it comes <unk> because it's comes with direct linux software and you know it is open source  
oh yeah  
yeah you'd be <unk> these things do  
yeah but that's that's i was thinking that's gotta be on the television  
yeah  
um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look and feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look and feel design  
yes  
but sometimes you have to take whatever you get and then just see how far that gets you  
so those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
but i in the our case i don't think there's anything more we can do really  
make your best guess  
slide show  
so should we give it a six  
mm  
not with two hands  
'cause you don't have control over numbers or  
when you want to turn off your device  
uh the buttons of course rubber i think everyone agrees  
nine 'til twelve and then <unk> you have or you  
um that what what what what i'm doing the moment i'm looking through the <unk> the uh stuff that robin put on the <unk> to say what's  
now it's not so bad with that if you really write it <unk> well  
yeah  
we want a fifty percent profit on this  
mm-hmm  
'cause i'm imagining like double curved is like you know  
yeah  
it's the replacement for triangle one  
the thing with i see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen  
eleven uh eleven euros sixty  
and negotiate that  
the problem is if i we are <unk> if a customer wants a certain component  
well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext  
i don't know if it looks like a cow  
basically i was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do  
yes one  
shall we quit here  
to ye yeah mm-hmm  
so on the  
and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that  
okay so scroll wheel  
i think that's actually something that should be in version two  
because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple  
yeah  
nope  
excellent  
that you have five minutes left or  
yeah  
by which time i mean when all's said and done the digital television  
very much so  
yeah indeed yeah  
yeah  
is anybody now terrified at the thought that we're live next week  
even now it doesn't have to  
mm  
yeah  
so i dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it  
you can  
you don't know  
yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it  
and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting  
case  
because that <unk> people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all <unk> everything that is being advertised like clothes  
okay  
<unk> yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology so  
oh  
so  
i wanna watch the pineapple channel  
mm-hmm  
this is describing the band you do the observations in  
mm  
so uh  
and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface discussing some of those um that we could change a little bit  
okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk> uh  
and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing  
so so what's is uh like it challenge was really good like sup they give the database so you have to work on that database  
yeah sure look  
so even they are seventy six percent is that high amount  
but they still need to um fit into people's decor though  
or uh multi purpose as we thought or do we want to use um many buttons  
but i i really don't think it's a good <unk> goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh <unk> when we talk about the materials  
perfect yeah  
is it a good design  
and the mm the material is expected to be spongy  
okay so you can market <unk> depending on that  
it's a sheep  
so it's not gonna be quite as clear if you can't can't chop it off  
me neither  
by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users  
well does it  
um <unk> there we go  
oh the way we uh-huh  
okay  
yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing  
and not losing  
uh this is on off switch 'cause i think we do need that and i think it gives it a nice balance  
but um oh i it can't be that hard to generate something that says  
um if you repeat that over time  
'cause  
right  
when it <unk> uh takes a shock  
yeah  
but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a <unk> a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large l. c. d. screen  
um  
identity yes  
yeah 'cause i'm sorry  
yeah i think isn't this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed  
right  
but i was thinking of the topic segmentation now and and <unk> for that there would only be one  
i two hundred  
then he can maybe find out to get his cord right  
from one to seven and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this  
uh no innovative yeah  
function f. eight  
if anything the that they gave me  
hmm  
yeah  
okay so the question is oh no it's different  
flux on its own wouldn't be a <unk> feature  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools <unk> in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um <unk> some notes or do some drawings  
thirteen  
mm-hmm  
<unk> we placed in terms of the alright  
yeah  
we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is  
yeah well <unk> uh at first i thought it was going to be cat  
hmm  
'kay  
yeah that's also true  
something which is not <unk> maybe uh not a box  
a mute button as well  
okay  
which i think is quite tricky  
mm-hmm  
and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well and that makes it more appealing it's more of a a new fun toy  
then then it's not <unk> i you can cho uh <unk> it's basically uh too like again do for all the samples in that gyro  
and um i hope you had a productive last thirty minutes  
are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there  
it's not a step backwards  
it really seems to be all about starting in the directory  
so  
do you want a chair maybe  
mm  
okay  
mm  
maybe i can find it  
so it's <unk> based on some stuff you put on there on the g. d. f. specification  
feedback  
probably  
mm  
okay a little less uh conversation  
okay  
hmm  
well not if the regions overlap okay  
so it should be really easy  
right  
yeah yeah you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway so ease of use it's not a very comp complicated device  
they're looking at whatever  
mm-hmm  
is  
yeah  
mm  
is it triangle one prime or something like that  
cool  
the carrot banana remote  
pretty impressive  
okay so let's go with a um touch screen  
mm-hmm  
no  
they want to pay for it people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like  
mm-hmm  
and this is <unk> based on just <unk> data at the moment from some part of the meeting  
okay  
but before  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
push button or a l. c. d.  
usually it it for instance is better to have the whole shot to decide on how to build the sub shots  
well th  
it falls within this range so for easy to use  
yeah  
but then again who wants to turn on a remote control  
yeah  
of course uh the more curves the more expensive  
yeah  
or is it just  
twenty  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
so those are the three um the three new requirements that that i was told  
how to make it big  
uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah  
no  
the structure and how many talks we're going to be able to have  
but that's not our part  
so that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch  
uh  
yeah  
uh and he could point at it that's true and say that is  
you know very soon  
okay yes  
but <unk>  
yeah alright but  
mm-hmm  
and uh line uh width  
yeah  
how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail  
oh okay  
and and lights  
i have no clue  
yeah  
but i'm i'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round it's like you press this or this or  
so  
simply it's a device as you know for uh  
and have you have you talked to th any of these people to ask them if they have any  
yeah and then you could have oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case  
and the feel of the material is expected to be <unk>  
um um worth the risk i think  
he cannot <unk> move even he's very in like <unk> how to say that  
okay well le  
'cause it's five five seven seven so  
yep  
yeah  
when do we need the one for the meet  
a <unk> okay this this is a <unk> first problem  
like <unk> switching the l. c. d. display if you want to use l. c. d. or you don't want you can just use normal button  
oh  
okay so we can hope that nokia will be using tandem tandem p. l. p. <unk>  
you find them in your in the map in the  
i'm not actually like for the programme manager then to call  
mm-hmm  
they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point  
yep  
that's some spots  
and one is going to mean true that we did actually achieve that  
i guess so  
i mean that i mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip  
right  
yeah i know but uh if you hold with your left hand and the wheel is here  
okay  
uh  
so uh any <unk> well any conclusions  
yes  
um couple main ones being like i dunno lemons or strawberries or something  
but um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there  
i mean yeah it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not  
mm-hmm  
it's texting  
mm  
yeah sure of course  
hmm  
two  
uh you have to work on user interface and you have to go through a trend watching  
okay  
yeah  
well no  
the the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on  
<unk>  
yeah  
one or two  
i think she is still finishing her  
yeah  
no but i think it's too early to really like discuss that in detail  
yeah  
yeah somewhere  
yeah  
yeah yes  
yeah those are the most used i guess  
um  
okay that was definitely something we can talk about  
so why are you overlapping  
for this phase it's um s. q. one or c. okay  
so that we we knew where to go on from there  
mm-hmm  
yeah th  
ah  
yeah that went <unk> it went well  
yeah so you see it's a different text  
yeah but but si uh <unk> <unk> <unk> when taken in account the the situation uh i think we performed pretty well  
so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co operation with the battery of course  
it's not new it's not innovative it's you know everybody does long remote because it's easy it's it's stable um  
mm-hmm  
the absorbed continuum  
yeah  
um i guess the sample <unk> sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing which puts up to four  
um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers  
alright so it might be very appealing if um we have very concise buttons  
okay  
what is a sample speaker  
um all these things have cost implications  
right  
it will be a one  
and re map that onto onto the length of a segment you know what i mean  
thank you very much nathan  
but obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells i assume right  
no i <unk> i think it means sort of individually  
so there's <unk> that's there's uh besides uh the remote control you'll have a separate uh  
but uh that that the segment  
i said well i'm just slowly getting into l. p. c.  
so just hopefully i in going through this very carefully you're going to notice these <unk>  
sorry  
it can be a part of  
uh or just energy also  
the rest are all standard although you could argue that should maybe be you were making these buttons down the bottom  
mm  
yeah  
and the <unk> uh  
yeah  
finally i found but  
a break in a spectrum is something you can point at  
yeah yeah yeah  
so um just to recap on are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket  
um  
mm  
technical  
i think you remember well the different uh parts  
'kay  
very nice very pretty  
l. c. d.  
um <unk> so it's <unk> like a <unk>  
yeah i mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something maybe  
no  
do we need um let me  
well i'm gonna draw um a <unk> piranha  
and then they can easy create their audio out of mm from that <unk>  
it's from sorry it's from one to seven  
i will uh  
so that's it for me  
look into it but anyway next  
to uh <unk> make it  
so you can just see the percentage  
or or silver  
yeah  
yeah <unk> in the menu  
it's just like that th this titanium  
ah no please  
um an options button  
but i think one maybe one option since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device  
okay  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff  
mm-hmm  
okay  
do it quickly if if we al already  
yeah that's not that  
etcetera  
yeah that g. dwarfs are things aren't they  
if i <unk> see i i knew that  
okay  
but this is like a remote control for children  
oh there it is  
i don't see it  
if not then mm we have to use some kind of semi <unk> supervised learning or some uh boot strapping to to to do the <unk>  
because it's a gadget and you want to show it off of course  
integrated scroll wheel push button yeah  
uh  
okay  
yeah  
what kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside  
and we <unk> <unk> put emission line features shouldn't we  
yeah  
uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh <unk> the remote control has to support  
we we must try to get them closer  
this company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots  
push button  
most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control  
<unk> should <unk> himself with the a. s. r. systems or whatever  
and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing  
whereas the <unk> yeah this one is direct  
<unk> yeah  
oh  
yeah but but draw something uh difficult  
lovely  
gonna have that on the side aren't we like there or something  
okay  
real real reaction  
yeah with the yeah i mean i di i di i did do hard <unk> hard drive check um and a memory check  
oh that's erase  
okay  
yeah  
i'm really excited to start this team  
yeah okay  
only words  
yeah people  
yeah  
yep  
well uh the laptops  
that's true yeah  
no i can't do long very impressive  
uh require some uh band width on the bus on the bus  
so  
and and the domain tasks okay they're now they now have to decide how many buttons to put on this thing  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
let's make it big  
it just appears so  
then uh  
or like children and grandfather's mode and the well the the user  
yeah right  
we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire um  
well that's interesting  
um  
that was great  
i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the t. v. set on recorders or thing like that and we can try <unk> to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because  
okay  
if you have the report because if you compute the um distance between the two histograms i think this was <unk>  
yeah <unk> uh for this use of the uh for the use of this term for the indicator of the uh degrees of interaction  
so it doe you can use uh thirty milliseconds or fifty millisecond window  
doesn't work too well  
mm  
but if it's very much detailed work  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
no no no no  
well what else  
so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well  
the time the time is still in there  
oh that's good  
i see  
yeah galaxy and galaxy formation doesn't count  
and um the to to uh have to uh numbers  
<unk> like yeah i can't <unk> i can't draw it  
um well i was just kinda wrapping up there  
i think i've saved mine already  
uh mm channel  
don't think <unk> lyman <unk> forest line blanket we took blanketing out  
i don't know  
alright  
smiling fish  
e. l. is it  
um  
what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions colours and forms in the in consistent use  
i i agree on that  
mm-hmm  
that's a scroll wheel  
just because of colour clashing and if we wanted to so and  
mm-hmm  
no but it i it's not a <unk> a beamer  
yeah  
very good  
and the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip  
so we're now going to <unk> have the lunch break  
mm-hmm  
yeah and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood  
or would that be <unk>  
it's like inventing a new car  
it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup  
'kay and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control  
yep  
i don't know if we have to do it now maybe later later  
lovely  
they want to  
or no  
ah  
it's a  
oh sorry  
<unk> meeting action sort of focus  
zero point one  
uh  
yeah  
yes  
and you <unk> and and and those two so and one of them is labelled and the other is not labelled  
yeah we we can give a preference to them  
alright  
because different people have a different opinion about fancy  
yeah  
or would that crash anything  
we made three for you  
whatever  
well  
mm-hmm  
that that should ra uh address all that  
uh combine style with a level of functionality um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and <unk> function  
rewind but it's also what is fast forward is also like next on a menu  
what about that  
then basically you two are gonna be working together on this  
so if in that tree display somebody clicks on something  
so it it's a very true point  
so where were the trends  
yeah  
oh  
like write up them here 'cause we all needed them separately kind of on the <unk> in this room  
in fact i i have seen a paper in i. c. m. l. where the guy was trying to learn which word he um aspects of clustering  
but is that for which  
point so maybe you should should uh  
because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every <unk> uh uh every other week  
yeah  
that was  
mm-hmm  
note note yeah all the <unk> and everything all the notes from any courses  
it was not very uh interesting uh very classical looking but that's <unk> that's not what we want  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
right  
or at least incorporating yeah  
and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions  
i think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up  
so we'll come to that later  
i think it's a little too much yeah  
it's a very positive thing if you see like that  
yeah  
bananas  
yeah  
yeah but i think the wireless problem is more the um david jordan's problem  
mm  
we have a very large department of paint  
yeah  
yes  
and your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside  
okay  
you could just press six enter or one two enter  
not just yet  
mm-hmm  
martin seemed to insist that when we have a visiting professor for instance  
uh uh yeah  
mm  
no maybe not  
yeah  
i see  
yeah  
um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting basically uh 'cause i know what i'm supposed to be doing now  
sorry  
i wasn't able to <unk> this yet  
um  
mm-hmm  
um we want it to cost uh absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents  
mm  
um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the l. c. d. screen uh instead of uh extra buttons  
has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape  
yeah  
and then on the separate thing we have on the  
i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those  
um  
it's more specific on uh meetings  
i i actually didn't know that it was possible to have these so you you you allowed these kind of embedded uh annotations  
yes okay  
yeah  
and you can straight away see there's less buttons  
oh yeah four legs  
or have we not decided  
it takes one number you press on the bottom it takes another number  
yeah  
still fifty six percent completed  
maybe yeah  
mm  
um how we can improve on the designs that that that i found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls  
so it'd be interesting to see if you agree with the decisions that they made about how to do things  
if you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact it's better  
right well done gabriel  
that's right  
um  
they like that  
so the l. c. d. screen uh attracts yes  
so i will  
what do you mean  
yeah <unk> but  
yeah  
you say programme start and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually  
so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information  
no because you think why not  
true  
and then we'll lose fifty cent in what  
mm-hmm  
oh basically the idea that i had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter  
yeah  
um then i've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production  
but i i i do know the type of scenario you're describing  
mm  
i've never attached to anything  
yeah i think they mean <unk>  
a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside and then a kind of spongy  
okay  
because <unk> we only need this to work well enough that you can use it for something and you got work rats  
yeah  
i like the the the the logo on there as well  
so excuse me for the uh inconvenience here but as you can see the keys moved  
well that's what they did uh manually after the afterwards  
but then still when we there's no room for a docking station or something  
is it too big  
mm  
mm 'kay  
so at first i will be responsible for um for yeah designing the technical functions of the um  
they're right on your screen so i don't know where you'd search  
you  
right  
right except that it's sort of odd and i'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are  
but but what i wanna know i is that which of them has the better representation of a given page  
yeah  
yeah  
nope  
there are those pictures that run all the way around so can we take the pictures down  
uh  
but i see that's yeah  
but i didn't i didn't go on the thought of a scroll wheel actually  
if we have here a link to the segment a like an i. d. for that segment  
um  
the the communication between the the extension and is uh of the  
mm-hmm  
you have a good reason for that  
yeah  
yeah  
well  
yes sure  
just gonna leave this up here 'cause i'll you know  
that's not uh the point  
can we do that  
because you got rid of the rubber we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
okay okay we will  
'kay  
because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds  
but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright  
yeah  
yeah  
it  
i guess this is uh make sure the <unk> works  
it's it is it is a task breakdown  
okay  
well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so  
but it's just easy enough to go through it with you so we're going for the kinetic power  
okay  
it's let me see if i can demonstrate  
you know about uh about this  
because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons so  
i see what  
yes  
uh  
that's gonna back fire on me  
something like that  
li that'll be the covers as well yeah yeah  
should they be white or black or  
i don't know  
if you do two in a row then that's an hour isn't it  
cool  
it's a channel selection a module this and this function go to the  
we want to have a a general remote control for everything  
yeah  
tap the thing  
um so then these just become normal coloured buttons so that might be some some way of cutting the cost  
anyway we are not using really advanced technology l. c. d. has already been ruled out a. s. r. has been ruled out  
is it just um to <unk> scrub your mechanism there  
yeah simple things with privacy issues but uh i there are some methods and everything is possible to make things private  
uh  
i mean if there's only one thing  
it's a very simple format yeah  
our interface elements there are shown in the in the drawing  
yes  
this is when you when you uh are <unk> the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th  
it it's easy to use uh it's got big buttons for doing the things i do most often changing the volume changing the channel  
how about the <unk> again you wanted to base it on sentence length as well  
no it's not good  
it's flat and curved  
yeah  
hmm  
so if we make the computing um <unk> disappearing on on the in the furniture  
they're also they define all this the speech condition  
well a at the moment the main data i that's just uh uniquely numbered throughout the entire corpus  
and there it's different because you're talking about the <unk> continuum which is a <unk>  
because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well  
they tried p. c. a. l. d. a. m. l. l. t.  
so mm uh so it yeah so probably voice recognition is is kind of important right  
i prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls  
i'm not sure it's even possible but maybe okay make it yeah find a little compromise in that but what did i write down  
okay  
was i was concerned about <unk> though was that it's while it has a high level of inside links that has a lot of directory style links as well that might mess up it actually being a see <unk> while you have  
yeah okay  
what we can change is to propose the customers with skins  
yeah  
um  
just few actions a few actions for everything  
yeah  
uh we're just getting we've got one cable and to the two <unk>  
<unk> mm the the extra work on is like you know converting the <unk> from <unk> to <unk> this kind of thing  
all together  
mm-hmm  
i mean blinks as well right  
hmm  
you have to use one hand  
it's capable of being squishy and fruity  
at i see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost  
okay  
but you <unk>  
and location finder  
no what you do is like you have the segmentation to train that for <unk> right  
too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it  
no that's uh that's the uh  
i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one and maybe add some features to it after yeah  
i must not forget my pen the next time  
no right now it probably won't be that much benefit  
yes but it but these are tasks that are only executed once i think  
so that's point three  
um research shows that they like to have a little l. c. d. screen on their on their uh zapping uh device  
uh yeah we have uh  
then we just need to run your neural net only yeah but p. p. p. l. p. <unk> are like hardly few minutes li  
i would say  
no  
can you use one blank sheet per drawing  
yeah  
yes sure  
well i think  
yeah  
why <unk>  
uh i'd agree with that i think  
<unk> <unk> you rewind  
wow  
excellent  
so anyway that didn't come into my mind so th that is a possibility  
yeah  
'cause i was talking with that uh about that to herve uh since i was uh i will recycle this poster for i. m. two  
well i just i just made the point i don't i don't know if that speech recognition is you know  
well  
that'd be handy  
because apparently from your survey people like colours no  
i don't know  
right  
very good  
yeah i've found that try and get it back  
so i think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well  
so you can just get it with a flag  
not sure where the <unk>  
oh yeah i know what you mean  
um that's a that's a decision for all of us  
it is <unk> it is rather easy to use because you have the primary buttons always visible  
what i said in the in the first uh discussion uh the digit six on the button it will disappear when it's from rubber  
and the code is based on open c. v.  
um you know the x. m. l. segments  
well that's the push button too right there  
norman  
yeah but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to <unk> to use the controller  
yeah  
but i'm not sure if it's the finished finished version yet  
you think  
um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider  
but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something  
there you go  
yeah  
well that's okay  
i'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well i'll put it in the project uh folder when i'm done uh just now  
um  
you know what i'm getting at here <unk> look at it from the side  
and possibility  
mm  
the buttons are also rubber  
so especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice  
we'll discuss that later  
you know where that's  
no it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved i think  
so you can capture voice yeah you <unk>  
we've decide we've <unk>  
might take up your whole living room  
uh frustrations of like people losing remote control  
after that i can move to another one  
probably a four at most  
yes they are  
alright and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button  
or should be covered or in l. c. d. screen  
okay what uh there's one more <unk> uh one more solution in fact  
that is very important  
i don't really like yellow in general  
yeah i i just saw it one minute ago  
i have no idea why we don't have it but  
mm  
so um uh also uh i would have liked to have seen the l. c. d. screen in it  
okay well that was what i had to say uh  
because i mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand  
mm  
these i've already given you  
okay  
yeah  
well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions  
and a standard yeah we don't no we have different colour  
mm yeah  
yeah and and yeah and and we're also marketing a product  
i i don't know  
or vice versa  
mm-hmm  
so oh okay  
no we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare  
yes and in fact at the moment i don't even know which of the two i'm <unk> over  
this is the conceptual one  
uh if we choose plastic we cannot choose solar cells for energy  
seven for me  
thank you  
that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope  
because one or two sides is really <unk> are really interested in this ontology stuff right  
but they display the segments in or that the utterances i in their um  
oh oh okay  
maybe <unk> spherical or something  
one  
i think uh the l. c. d. is cheaper than speech recognition  
okay cool  
yeah  
yeah i forgot yeah yeah uh <unk> producer and and that's it  
so that's uh basically what i want to talk about  
yeah  
i'll save it alright uh save  
very democratic  
i mean t. n. o. is and d. f. k. i. is right  
i'm going to bore you with a  
i i well it doesn't we haven't really <unk> i would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five  
it's just too silly  
mm-hmm  
i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing  
um that's it's something under signal where you can adjust the amplitude as well on resolution  
yeah but i mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really hasn't it  
oh okay  
yeah  
that's right  
is there a way of  
so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here  
so  
yeah okay  
oh then maybe voice  
ah yeah  
yep  
because we don't at all understand at the moment how the internal data structure like how the loading works  
see i wasn't there  
tim can you start  
for example um you just put it down it <unk> for example  
we could actually look at into it but i dunno it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and  
uh or sponge i guess isn't on there right  
mm-hmm  
no i don't think so  
on the design  
it was  
okay  
also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing if you wanna make it square for the looks of it  
yeah  
<unk>  
well i don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro you know  
uh no but that's not a good idea because that could well be outside the displayed area then  
yeah more information about the costs  
yeah exactly and then there is yeah  
oh a fish  
okay  
uh <unk> but then again it's also very close to haymarket so it's even less of a diversion for you probably  
a be  
you know all that <unk> batteries right and  
grease paint  
um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control because it it defines the uh  
mm-hmm  
and uh so you functions what for the buttons <unk> function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves  
yeah that's right  
definitely lemon shaped  
they've got i mean they've got standard sort of intuitive um  
uh then we have it on the t. v. the menu  
right  
yes but but a lot uh  
yeah that  
and so  
like yeah we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables  
if we use the speech recognition  
and it turns out it is zero because it's the same thing that you anyway uh so we figured out it's interesting  
flipping pages  
okay  
yeah  
'cause it's really easy to do basically  
yeah  
um f. five  
okay for now this is this is okay  
yeah it <unk> yeah  
and it means you have to read through the list of utterances when you're compiling all the data over and over and over and over again  
um i think that's <unk> almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top  
any questions on these  
that looks right  
yeah they were also confused  
don't worry  
uh i think we can leave this question for olivier  
mm  
um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here  
that should hopefully do the trick um  
they have uh also uh a kind of uh um  
mm-hmm  
is <unk> okay  
more  
um the materials are <unk> there as you can see but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved uh which would be  
yeah quite  
or are you going to prime them in any way  
i i think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them  
so we have uh forty minutes so i think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each  
and so yeah  
what were you talking about with the lighting up buttons  
so final design  
uh i think automatic on off control uh it's not possible  
i think the task of this latent model is to discover some some semantic like some topic proximity between documents  
um 'cause at the moment uh only outputs the video  
you can put the r. and r.  
um right okay  
we could put the board next to well  
the <unk> new topics are effectively going to just be garbage  
mm  
i didn't know if you received the same mail  
yeah  
so it's uh just uh <unk> samples of the <unk> and it choo chooses  
just like the  
alright  
oh okay sorry  
but when the <unk> older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control it would be less appealing than a white one  
where if it was to have a speech recognition thing you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit  
because a soft excess is a uh i mean that's an x. ray thing  
um i have just started  
so uh they are <unk>  
um  
yeah i do  
i mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry but it could have the curves of a strawberry or something  
um you know i think in general for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive  
i wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea imagine that i dunno that it's within the shape of the hand it's quite small  
if we we had to include more functions  
okay  
we have the simple design  
we don't have <unk> product yet so kind of difficult  
and if you put a front on it there's a hole on the front  
say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can  
then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices like wood rubber titanium or latex  
well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons we're good  
okay perfect  
uh  
well anyway yeah  
this meeting it's not very long  
yeah  
but is it isn't that a already on t. v. a lot of new t. v. <unk>  
'cause if if the thing the two <unk> the two things are now <unk>  
on the side  
well we do not have very much time uh left  
maybe soft material or something  
you wish  
mm-hmm  
so uh  
doesn't that make sense  
oh yeah alright  
mm  
then you would make a four  
mm  
it's a it's a new technology so <unk> <unk> might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the <unk> so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology  
maybe we should um download a dictionary and check our utterances before we uh listen to make sure that they're actually real words  
yeah  
great  
okay  
yep  
no uh i did  
yeah  
but you know  
it's not really handy  
okay  
okay oops  
twenty eight  
yeah  
so what do you want to put down  
so anyway i haven't looked much into that  
no if it's not uh i guess you would have to install it and so on  
but i'll wanna have a qui have a quick look and see see how easy it is to add this things to it  
yep  
yeah  
titanium  
okay  
which is different  
and the another problem is that uh it's not band width variable  
but that doesn't mean that it's you could still say that's damped lyman alpha and that's damped lyman alpha  
i can't imagine a <unk> wooden remote control  
it's like the way it all comes all cute  
sure  
oh  
right  
yeah  
so <unk> it's it's not a huge problem because i i it is <unk>  
so in a couple of days we will get this um uh the fire wire uh box  
if you are given a choice you want to take raid one or raid five or a simple laptop  
oh okay  
mm  
is a <unk> are they also like lizards or are they yeah they are mm-hmm  
or or that would be a good start  
keck is yeah  
uh it's important um yeah great  
but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so  
then you get a complex signal and if you take just the amplitude then you get hilbert envelope code  
uh the first time is done <unk>  
yeah  
but if it's like all the t. v. stuff was here then all the v. c. r. stuff was here  
one  
uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have  
yeah  
or softer rubber or yeah  
um  
ninety  
mm  
so <unk>  
did did you guys actually had sort of um the interaction or discussions while you we doing the annotation  
um then each of you will have your presentation um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control  
um we've got about another ten minutes  
i think all of that is um just that is process  
it's our main target  
or maybe you can like have a a smell <unk> rama you know you push a button and it <unk> puts out a stink  
right  
okay  
mm  
okay  
that <unk> uh anyway that when i run it on that uh what i found was  
we do  
yeah  
no th those things are not disturbed  
yeah  
yeah  
it is  
pretty normal that's what you do with a remote control  
could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile  
okay  
what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this  
and then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used  
i can quickly make a conclusion  
um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes  
very stuff okay rubber rubber desi okay yeah  
oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech <unk> if we incorporate speech recognition  
have it kind of look how they want to different colours things like that probably just plastic because that's always the lightest  
you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to <unk> to have the exact shape  
little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it you know both individually and as a team  
okay  
you can touch it  
an agreement at the end  
that's mine  
it's an optional  
yeah <unk> thick spongy cover so it feels like the whole thing's spongy but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it  
i think so  
right so uh i mean this really only displays uh th those cases where you disagreed  
yeah well we need the advanced  
could somebody start calculator  
could be uh  
'cause we've only got five channels  
and it does  
hmm  
and then steve presented um the results of following people around and looking at how they used their notes from meetings  
and then  
yeah  
so it's not really a constraint in that sense but i mean these are functionally you know the base what the technology has to do  
it make watching t. v. healthy  
right okay  
a little uh too a little bit  
hmm  
because even if that may not seem obvious to us if that's what the surveys brought out i think that we should probably go along with that  
the next meeting starts in thirty minutes although does it  
yeah  
evaluate it's again subject to <unk> uh because for speech <unk> yeah  
it that's something definitely to mark up  
and setting buttons  
yeah fine  
good  
you might have trouble incorporating the screen  
what  
yeah  
if you have the language you have to develop for each country  
or if you want to store a <unk> with a keys  
is the uh you know we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here  
well if this isn't obvious  
um don't wanna sort of overkill  
yep  
more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new but  
okay so regarding the automatic speech recognition i think this is  
the full signal  
perfect  
who's uh who's doing named entities besides yoshi  
let's see what we have here  
the detailed ones would be sort of brightness uh <unk>  
yeah  
and such things  
it's  
yeah  
there there's some might be some work to do but the general idea i think it's it's fair evaluations it's a task  
well what do i have to say  
so still we want to keep l. c. d.  
ah it's a shark yeah  
so  
okay  
i'm four  
um especially for future users uh i'm thinking of early adopters because they they use new technology first  
i dunno  
oh okay i thought you had done all of them and  
i think like my colleague you said is that's <unk> better or for the elderly people something like like the ipod or something with round squares  
if you have the same uh decomposition right  
the <unk>  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so we still have one uh four  
oh yeah  
not too big  
i di  
thank you tim  
uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line  
it's hierarchical in x. m. l. and key frame time stamp and the and from the time stamp and the video location he knows how to get the frame  
technologically innovative  
oh  
yeah  
oh right okay  
yeah kind of um maybe  
uh some of the <unk> objectives are that is has to be original trendy and user friendly  
if it scores higher than the ones already in the summary so far just replace them  
huh  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
no but i i i was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us  
that means objects that are identified and maybe at a particular red shift based on it  
oh  
yeah  
you did  
but uh we decided to do to do uh it this way  
yeah  
would give <unk> a headache as well  
you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one if you know what i mean so  
for reasons that i don't really know  
so what do all these things in this file have in common  
it's like if you <unk> want a programme only to run once and only a part of it  
and the manufacturing <unk> tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices  
so that's a kinda new uh thing  
yeah okay i'll i'll post it  
true  
hmm  
'cause the the <unk> that i was tried to install it and there there are the voices like cat voice and these voices this is not the one  
yeah  
maybe other ones could be something else shaped  
on the left uh top yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
ah the logo should be on the top i think  
mm  
oh um uh on my holidays we encountered a children's <unk> where there we there were <unk>  
like uh companies can have like a range of products and  
okay  
why not try to to to to study this relationship to improve this relationship to use this relationship for um mm whatever it is  
close <unk> i don't know how much it would cost  
yeah  
but  
okay and uh i'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to  
some  
it mi it mi yeah  
but uh  
uh  
i think it's a one i think  
the <unk> is yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well uh  
mm  
and you're not exactly <unk> uh  
so we have to to make it <unk> uh more uh it has to be  
but it yeah  
uh i've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind  
okay special colour  
um <unk> this part is quite specific to a microphone array where like they are concentrated in uh some place like in the middle of the table  
so we can discuss these points  
no i think it's just something you you put over them because yeah we <unk> yeah you ca well  
i think even that i mean that would be a fairly cheap thing compared to an l. c. d. screen  
<unk>  
yeah  
my favourite animal which changes all the time okay  
but i think the important thing might be to choose one  
uh yeah yeah you should present that  
uh what would you say we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design  
but it it's not here so far  
was it  
so we'll be able to have line in sorry  
and we can sort of base it around that  
okay guys  
yeah yeah  
but yeah it's it's not like sample speaker but it will just beep so we still have the locate  
was no  
<unk> something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends  
uh it's i think in manufacturing i guess it's problematic  
f. five  
next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards so it um  
mm-hmm  
everybody says it so that's what's uh yeah um  
no i don't think so because uh watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time  
to uh <unk> to <unk> the command  
yeah  
give our own interpretation to because else we would really have a problem  
yes  
even though we claim radio galaxies i this should be underlined  
alright  
no they could just make a mistake or screw up yeah  
a bit out of date  
yeah  
yeah  
no transcriber will be checking their own transcriptions  
read only  
and then i i just <unk> it a bit  
yeah  
yep  
so i don't know where it was  
but um  
yeah okay  
yeah so you don't have to stare at that infra red 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently  
too a bit whiter i think this type of things should be fine  
oh  
and to me if i'm gonna market a product for <unk> for beauty for for design i'm gonna i'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price  
mm  
uh designs  
no you <unk> they both put they both put their hands on a construct because they don't like it  
yeah automatic speech recognition  
another quite good thing might be um how are you do you know how easy it is to apply two tips to things in java  
maybe not the nicest feel  
mm-hmm  
uh and then uh if you press the op options button now we have an example of  
um  
hmm  
so it's put the hyphen and then  
it wants  
yeah but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger  
one  
<unk>  
true  
with the cold calling you can usually at least find out whether they're alive and get an an offer to to get something  
<unk> i in the same way that if you had broad line it would be in there  
so  
and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or  
yeah yeah  
the last one is the most important one is it  
wouldn't you like to have a calmer spot  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
i have one more idea  
yeah yeah  
the fashion now this is seems a bit odd to me  
okay  
so it can bounce  
mm-hmm right sure  
um the glow in the dark fluorescent whatever system um is a go ahead  
like <unk> <unk> how much money they have to spend or something like that like  
no  
okay  
okay  
and uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me  
yeah  
yeah  
i i think you're right anyway  
um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now  
what does it taste like  
it is the new it would be in a class of its own  
okay  
so what are you <unk> going to do now  
<unk> <unk> you get the picture  
no  
i mean if we are gonna make it a novel i mean double curved sounds good to me if we're talking about <unk> ergonomic and easy use  
ten minutes of that will probably be set up time as well  
okay well we leave it like this  
possibly  
the the arrow functions  
<unk> some special ones available like this one right here which is marketed towards children  
commas are fine  
uh-huh  
so we can go on to  
my personal thought was uh rubber because i had an email i believe it was from you uh <unk> against falling  
that's not where you're putting it  
you can email later  
so are we headed towards like a <unk> a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that  
yeah  
i think the titanium is very important  
i believe uh miss uh <unk> is with us as well in the control room  
the ergonomics the way it fits in your  
<unk> yeah  
yeah  
um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions  
and the other one's green  
but would it be easy to use then  
and uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control  
it th when <unk> uh you use a system um hardware  
can nite handle just loading arbitrary uh new like attributes and stuff  
hmm  
i mean presumably  
yeah it's perfect  
and the key issue here is is being trendy and original  
yeah  
mm  
i'll just go through there  
oh yeah yeah  
mm  
that's no problem we will sell more  
it's not intuitive first  
yeah  
fascinating compelling even  
um  
next one is curving  
well other ideas  
so  
so basically that's what we don't want  
no  
and uh well first for both they have um a special shape maybe the designer can uh explain better than me but uh it's like a surf board  
uh well it's an idea in a so  
yeah exactly  
um  
the little lightning bolt in it very cute  
yeah we could just make  
it's a very smart it's a very smart controller maybe  
on the trajectory you can see that it works like kind of um voice detector  
um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal  
um and then the question is well how does you know  
yeah these yeah  
so  
um or a stutter i would say  
okay  
let's go with our our uh rounded  
yes  
okay  
okay so  
<unk> reporting or what i  
mm  
what do you want to do now  
seven  
b. s. c. w.  
uh  
or do you want the number of different ones  
yeah  
suppose i have to do my presentation  
i dunno  
it's great  
and then you would map your information onto individual words  
yes but you also want to know what's next  
alright so um decisions what the okay <unk> decisions on energy i'm thinking is based on the battery  
yeah i think that's probably more straightforward  
better decision  
'kay this was old  
you're not taking anything in  
uh let's just let's see what okay let's just see what we no we we have to be under twelve and a half  
okay  
you know what i mean like not not the whole corpus but every meeting that has to do with one topic  
i think there are ways we could maybe simplify the  
no not not in g. s. m. definitely definitely not  
alright  
ah  
what you can do is smooth the edges indeed  
and if you look at the collaborative problem solving stuff maybe it won't do every that you want  
you might need the to che keep checking the battery  
um i guess real reaction did some market research  
right this is the most important part  
first of all uh comes user requirement  
the user <unk> interface communicates with the chip so i'll basic go over to the  
no  
yeah  
on a day like this i know it's a yeah  
um i don't actually have a favourite animal but for the for th for this meeting i'll <unk> draw a little  
yes i think so  
thanks  
top easy to use  
and uh  
um and probably in colours maybe fruity vegetable colours  
um martin made another point  
well since it's the through the whole technology type thing um you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them  
in a way  
ah uh okay  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah what the which channels the viewer  
yeah  
and then there is no backup  
of your signal  
well i guess this this button the the the okay menu okay  
yeah  
but i this more goal directed might actually make it easier to um bring these things to publication in the long run right  
the main uh important thing what a remote control should do  
and eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy  
um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and <unk> might be a separate product that could be suggested to management  
but <unk> also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare  
i don't know  
and it's stylish  
so as you scroll through your stations you can <unk> it actually tells you what it is  
you're old fashioned  
i go slightly up  
okay be careful  
yep  
just see can we have this files somewhere  
thanks for coming to this meeting  
we'll see later  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
okay  
this something we didn't thought about  
well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important but we didn't have any white play doh  
yeah yeah it's happened uh it happened with my friend  
hmm  
<unk> gonna be hundreds of those  
it's kind of yeah  
and the volume  
more than one curve uh yeah okay  
and then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals these elephants who are indian and  
okay that's not mu not much functions  
so they're yeah  
if if it if it becomes a yeah  
okay  
this is a <unk> another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five  
so you can um start <unk> checking by <unk> well you you know  
it doesn't really matter  
thumb shaped  
uses maybe gives us a new potential market  
yeah  
damped lyman alpha absorbers i think that's a <unk> feature even though it's  
yeah  
or  
and the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line  
so no red or green  
so first uh the approach is quite sim simple  
okay  
mm  
the guy  
i mean of parts of presentation  
she should have an office by her own because it would be quite disturbing for other people to to work in the the same office  
uh the trends  
you know zero to nine so you can move to a channel the power button on slash off  
so  
ah  
um about the the material  
in interesting  
yeah uh a two a two  
okay  
uh cool  
uh  
so you know ask craig instead  
okay  
<unk> sit the banana sits in there <unk> you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself  
'kay  
can you say that if a set of documents if the clustering of these documents is closer to the <unk> what you what you've got there is uh a clustering of documents a as your devaluation  
no but well we yeah we keep the screen  
but you you hold it like this  
mm  
or <unk>  
so so we want the speech <unk> and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables  
with uh two two two parts controller  
so um we have the option that we can put in an a. fixation thing here right as well  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah but  
yes  
yeah  
it's impossible to use it  
do you think  
it is  
yeah  
by the way i was uh going to ask so i had seen the video i you uh did um a <unk> of the video right  
uh <unk> hopefully it's make <unk> makes uh pay pay some extra  
yeah you want to show the beautiful banana you have  
so but yeah that's probably the next thing they'll have to do  
better aligned or what's the word  
the problem with the l. <unk> l. c. d. screen is that elderly people <unk> from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the l. c. d. screen a lot  
okay  
yeah  
huh  
we have <unk>  
mm  
afro beat orchestra very cool  
that isn't rubber  
it's good to  
uh it yeah it depends yeah  
<unk> how do you think the remote should um function for the user  
i can go first yeah  
yeah that's what i would have thought  
yeah  
but uh you can still discuss about it but but click it in an application that's a lot easier to process  
so  
right  
um yeah i think it's and so <unk> could we um  
no we don't at all  
is that what everybody got  
one acronym  
yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the <unk> <unk> on the lower half of the screen  
are you is it yeah  
okay  
mm <unk>  
and then  
so so that mean <unk> <unk> we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control  
'cause i liked teenage mutant hero turtles  
yeah bob please  
mm-hmm yeah like i would say that for programming uh keys you said  
because if you if you can be if you can if you are uh highly reliable about one page  
what's important for me i guess is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons  
well it at the moment the that's what i was assuming on on on doing that uh it's done first  
yeah  
so maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect  
oh yeah sorry yeah then  
i think another point here and i don't know how you you feel about it is well  
completely pointless yeah  
you've lost uh your microphone there  
yeah  
so next year you could make next year's model the same but have it as a a yeah <unk> whatever a lemon  
when i uh  
oh <unk>  
no not really  
um  
okay  
the guy yeah  
yeah  
oh right  
or maybe you should guess what i'm drawing eh  
yep  
that was just what i  
it's more round than square  
and we're gonna look at the percentage of of that time where they're both in the same region  
well uh you we can make for for instance for t. s. r. t. s. r. uh videos  
but i mean if the if the if they had th they had this sort of epiphany at the end of this meeting where they decided well why are people browsing this  
maybe it's easier if you guys come over here  
mm  
they're working on um pink titanium  
there you go  
this is how embedded one will  
yes  
mm-hmm  
so  
yeah  
and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and  
i yeah i remember frank came to me and says is everybody was computing like marius we would be all dead  
what was uh the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition  
ascii and but only the problem's again acronyms and sometimes it expands sometimes it may not expand because it's not in their dictionary so yeah  
and yeah <unk> sorry  
no it modifies ratios  
well i think it's quite clear there  
and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um  
mm-hmm  
uh both audio and <unk> video uh in a cordless way  
uh it's really  
it's it's all too much buttons  
and well actually we yeah we did need some more data on finances but <unk> yeah we still don't have that apparently  
mm-hmm  
yeah another task or  
yeah  
leave  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
make it sound eloquent  
uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set  
no  
yeah we make some extra profit of it  
oh my god  
it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote  
okay  
behind our product  
yeah  
yeah  
i think we just discuss it  
we will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh  
materials yeah  
um just uh displays several buttons for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use <unk> uh buttons  
yeah  
why can't i work here  
mm-hmm  
it's less important right  
mm  
well uh  
i  
yeah it says you two  
mm-hmm  
<unk> what is the buttons made of rubber  
i think it's a very  
when in compared to to th the others the previous one  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
mm  
strawberries  
because she was our i interface expert  
they couldn't actually log in  
never mind  
so you could have like i mean i suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it  
exactly  
i'm guessing it would but got like the definite information  
one minute please  
we have yes but and yellow  
i don't think you'll be twiddling your thumbs no  
yeah  
um but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control  
hmm  
but you have no interaction back with it you know  
and that's it  
i don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i'm when i'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control  
which endangers the time to market and of course would make it more costly i think  
well we're marking up a lot of higher level things in our  
um ow  
okay so  
we're we're good yeah  
have it <unk> be something that looks different  
you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also  
that's all i think  
yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of <unk> of all the components that <unk> <unk> are gonna be absolutely necessary <unk> to have a working remote  
because uh at at t. p. f. n. there is a lab that is uh has done almost the same thing  
i think these are more important than the first ones so  
um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip  
okay  
and it's twelve euros i think  
okay  
how do you know it's that  
yeah  
should we make it a button or some some something which would be  
it's <unk> no it's not fancy any more  
and then the scroll buttons are again cool features  
chief  
right so it it puts an extra burden of proof on the work that you do  
there's  
well you you will get used to it  
i don't see why but  
yes you could  
right  
hmm  
participant two  
<unk> i i i just  
plus uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh well a small actual face  
this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab you can shake it if it's out of power  
well at the moment we have a lecturer that can i can never quite <unk> tell if he's saying problem or programme  
okay i'm i'm okay with that  
<unk> oh  
do you want me to  
and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them  
okay  
okay okay  
be yeah uh  
mm-hmm  
so we need a different theory  
you know like th uh this <unk> the bit you keep and this is the expensive bit this is like the chip and this is the microphone  
because yeah  
but they're i their categories of stuff now i <unk> my kind of assumption was that that this was j. p. land  
yeah  
not the the thing  
it is an still an option but not for this price  
ah  
yeah  
what  
yes sure  
yeah but uh um  
do we hardly i think it should be at the bottom somewhere  
what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that  
so they're frustrated a lot  
um  
didn't we just do that  
orangutan  
mm-hmm <unk>  
and the <unk> okay  
in most families don't isn't the remote is a remote  
really  
uh first is remote control have <unk> ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh <unk> reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands  
so there's our numbers  
uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh  
yeah  
um  
okay  
you always have your remote  
mm yeah  
that's one  
no no  
short cut to ami shared folder  
and uh if if you really ask me even the structure which was there real every point by point how p. l. p. is well generated  
um the closest button that was used well the <unk> the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button  
like i'm imagining that sort of thing i don't know what th that <unk> called  
uh the phase or you just uh re can again the phase can be replaced by the noise which is pretty good  
or two  
i mean it i think <unk> what you're doing in a group discussion isn't necessarily one coherent argument <unk> for the person  
mm-hmm  
so if the <unk> the batteries are dead  
um i'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these <unk> slides  
no the damped lyman alpha absorption systems we crossed out  
a distinct class of source i don't think  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
now what did we <unk> we say about acronyms where part of it was useful  
well <unk>  
mm 'kay  
it it shouldn't the there shouldn't be any great uh problems  
so  
so when it's dark  
um oh there must be a way of detecting whether the <unk> loaded  
uh true  
he said why but i we have only three more lectures  
kind of this this look  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we had we had too little information actually  
mm  
that's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive  
maybe you can draw your favourite animal  
yeah  
we'll have to uh <unk> <unk> specify the different uh types we want to launch when we uh well introduce our remote  
and then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot  
okay  
yeah  
something like that which could be um a l. c. d. let's say or um an array of push button something like that  
so first of all um i wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source  
yeah  
yeah  
sign  
that's nice  
but then i don't know about <unk>  
um and they can be very very affectionate  
uh it's it's still for little children  
yeah everything worked  
and okay i'm i'm asking you as an expert  
mm it you kind of have visual suppression when you move and it's the same when you're blinking  
to have not uh very expensive tables  
uh no there's very little documentation as you might imagine for these sort of things  
up down or left right  
yeah so you can capture <unk> voice from different directions  
oh my god  
yeah  
yeah  
so this i is not even a problem  
you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control  
these would be like the rubber the rubber grips  
warning  
so kind of this  
you have a <unk> uh  
so so are you having the stand by on the front then  
so speak directly to the t. v. and you don't need a remote control actually so  
yeah it's a bit difficult  
daniel what do you think about here  
yeah i suppose my search will <unk> it returned the utterance  
okay  
so i guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model i dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life i dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website  
yes it it's probably doing it's probably doing quite the same thing in the end  
hello again  
okay  
i i didn't <unk> see anything about it so i already uh thought you uh you were to do that  
the the shaking of your body which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake uh it charges it  
like voiced <unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah with s. and r. different s. and r. <unk>  
no uh  
but um unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that we have to have a push button as the interface we can't do anything fancier  
i think so  
okay  
i don't know  
like maybe weighted with the search terms and then extract them  
it's yeah it's pretty it's pretty high tech  
'cause that would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interface for the data would have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and and everything  
yeah  
it's not that it doesn't work  
thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one  
you can uh draw  
you know what are the things that <unk> the set of exchanges that can happen  
but i think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics but  
this is the main function okay  
function f. eight  
the simple uh <unk> school board  
alright  
but they do want some gadgets  
mm-hmm  
lost yeah  
i think  
yeah <unk> i'm yeah i was just thinking that it can act it can probably be done on display level  
no it's more than  
i. c. <unk>  
because it's open you mean  
the remote  
celebrate  
yeah  
yours is  
screwing up  
it's a wombat  
um how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that  
that's not how you spell method is it  
yeah  
yeah  
oh yeah  
into life  
that's yeah  
i have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor  
okay  
and uh okay  
dual use perfect  
i know what you mean yeah  
mm  
i think it's uh it's good if he submits his <unk> proposal  
and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah that's true  
so i think the pen's good  
the other hand i mean it shouldn't be like should be like fifty mega byte in ram or something it shouldn't be massive should it  
okay  
just make a button on your t. v. and just hit the button it beeps somewhere  
have you got that for no it's just for one meeting at the moment  
the thing is i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from i don't know if you'd instantly say mango  
um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme  
mm-hmm  
so this whole information we would then store in this ah no  
yeah  
yeah okay  
yeah i'm not sure  
mm  
uh  
yeah that's definitely interesting  
which turns out to be on budget exactly pretty much  
what is this  
or we can switch on or switch off the the special yeah  
yep  
hmm  
oh then forget about it  
uh no no no no  
even if little bit of  
oh and f. eight  
yeah we're really nice  
yeah we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out but you <unk> you can you can just say find and he repeats find  
yeah true  
so what can you  
no  
this is no uh i mean l. p. c. ten is just l. p. c.  
so um for them it was just how many devices control  
okay  
i'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers  
yeah  
a device which is pleasant to to watch to see  
which is a shame  
great  
and for all together like the display itself  
yes  
okay so that <unk> ends my presentation  
so if you say okay now it's uh yeah  
okay  
yeah  
just the mac font bothers me even  
i i have a picture if you just a moment i'll i'll show you  
okay  
yeah that should be for  
uh you would <unk> you wouldn't see the uh straight panel but more <unk> and round  
like for i don't know if instead of s. m. s. you can really have some channel where you just right  
because and uh wait uh wait a few seconds  
so we've simplified we don't need all those um play fast forward rewind  
but when you handle it you put it on and off  
well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone  
the trouble is that hue isn't a very sensible scale  
i <unk> i think as far as the co you know <unk> <unk> <unk> coding goes  
basic or multifunctional  
yeah  
hmm  
location  
huh  
so depends on what we decide we wanna do  
well <unk>  
we can't get  
okay  
mm-hmm  
i'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the <unk> <unk> lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy <unk> these days  
that's a bit your <unk> standard design  
oh okay okay  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
mm  
this kind of looks you like  
so if if for every yep you'd be sure that it's an agreement than that wouldn't be a problem  
oh is that 'cause it's flat  
fifty cent  
i mean otherwise  
because that makes it a lot easier than to <unk> put it on utterance level  
<unk> to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets  
this is the remote control  
i mean it might help with the <unk>  
<unk> one point eight and one point nine galaxies  
you know  
it <unk> it would make it quite complicated where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the  
and jean probably maybe you should do the same  
and we still have money left  
i li i'm liking that idea this idea of a touch screen remote with multi format features  
okay  
that's that's not a it's a  
because when the band is narrow the <unk> excitation is close the carrier is close to <unk> sinusoid basically co sinusoid  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
we really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it  
for the first application we will do with uh prototypes it will be more about quantity uh of speech or how long  
no problem we can  
mm-hmm  
you know that could be the charger  
yeah  
yeah  
i dropped a  
so unfortunately i don't have a calendar  
mm  
mm-hmm  
mm  
um as for the  
so there's a little bit of give there  
<unk> your first presentation to make this clear but then you had some <unk> time problems  
just to activate it  
yep one one thing i don't understand is <unk> they've they've given us this package okay  
yeah  
yeah different remote controls yeah  
mm three  
for that you need it's possible maybe uh on interfaces like flash or java  
okay  
yeah yeah  
open uh  
mm no not really  
i'm sorry to have  
so let it be like this at uh at this moment  
but that's like a separate analysis right  
'kay  
hmm  
so then we'll just have to <unk> uh have to go on you know  
um  
at the bottom  
everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology in fact it could use it could mean not  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
it's going to be very slim  
so what's your uh grade  
so the more frequent buttons should be larger they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control  
mm  
um  
i mean maybe it's just me but i didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all  
sure um so what is it you're asking of me now  
alright  
mm-hmm  
um what colour  
backwards up down channel numbers volume uh freeze frame  
um at the moment it doesn't really care how many meetings it's displaying  
so this is true for susan and maggie but not true here for <unk> and and and martin  
that's true  
i  
because we have red  
okay  
but uh well  
i think i just opened up the template  
no no but they're they're they're down in the database section  
hi my name's uh  
r. e. a. r. e. a.  
mm  
no  
you know for life guaranteed for life  
i dunno what <unk> what we have to decide about that  
yeah  
mm  
i think if you're watching enough t. v. to get repetitive strain injury from um you know  
but that's something that's out there  
whilst at the same time you want as you rightly said one remote for all  
oh okay yeah  
mm everything  
mm  
we're talking twenty five pounds or twenty five euros  
then i can see the market niche but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext  
should like this  
okay then uh i'd i'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not because that's uh determines everything i'm gonna do  
yeah so that's approach um well i was going to do  
but um just in in that we want this to be stylish should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid  
and so what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the r. r.  
let's say two yeah  
it's like the eraser can erase whatever you want  
if you use colour l. c. d.  
so um you know i mean luckily we chose a nice simple shape  
um all you need to do is just one value  
<unk>  
november  
oh  
well i thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the d. v. d. also and teletext and that kind of stuff  
uh that's th we no that because um the gaze position will be a sort of fuzzy area  
i mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition for example  
yeah  
because you <unk> the <unk> the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you  
any other essential functions that we need  
then you need to send the signal out so because if you're using infra red the line of sight um say the t. v. <unk> at that chair  
up  
i don't think there is much left  
there is it's a research group of i know i don't think it's <unk>  
um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that  
how do you feel  
twelve nearly thirteen yeah  
yeah but as the marketing manager says people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design  
alright something went wrong  
yeah should we not have like a group directory or something where we can put all our code in and that kinda thing  
how do i uh  
um well we have our beautiful drawing  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah that's that's uh for older people it's it's more that classical look  
because people like that  
it's a <unk> it's a new feature you can make make a double feature <unk> like a button on the top and under it  
i can delete it for you if you want  
well i think it's uh i think it's pretty trendy to be honest  
so you think we have to do it now  
do you need to change anything on it  
yeah because we have more colours than only black  
i thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that  
but  
so what i'm saying is from my perspective i don't have a product to market right now  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
half  
because if i had a company and i'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things i and i have to <unk>  
thank you very much  
yeah  
so  
good  
if it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there you could just bounce it up and down  
oh yeah  
well i'm not sure if it's shaken enough because  
yellow and  
yeah  
and uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires  
i'll hand it off to you and um  
so that means the operating <unk> was using quite a lot of functions  
i think if we do this as it's uh uh <unk> uh it's really <unk> on the design  
means if you have a second um which is uh a hundred and one samples i was just keeping the central ten ten samples  
yeah  
i mean they'll it's not gonna be so big that we can't load in a information density for every utterance  
mm-hmm  
all these options  
yes  
oh the slogan  
that's all we really need  
interface designer okay first guess was right  
okay  
and  
yeah  
thank you  
yeah it's <unk> it's not p. l. p. at all <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah too too uh it was just in case they had something that what  
they don they don't own all images of apples  
if anyone feels that they have free time uh this is a joke  
yeah mm-hmm  
okay  
i don't want to and he doesn't so it's up to him  
it will  
that's <unk> data on the display  
that's what you do  
yeah  
but if you put yeah in another directory uh then it would work or or a new naming convention with uh special uh yeah code uh  
energy source um our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources your standard battery solar cells  
free coke provided at the cafeteria  
and that's your right brain taking over <unk> wanting the artistic the fashionable the hip you know  
yeah  
hard to know how we are going to incorporate that  
and then you translate to n. x. t.  
but beyond that i haven't looked at it at all which is something we should really do  
um so i'll just show you how that works  
yep  
right  
um just wanna make sure you do  
we're not throwing anything away  
yeah  
what was it  
well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the <unk> the increased functionality  
star formation we weren't putting in  
we have to speed up  
mm-hmm  
because if you have to to say <unk> i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels  
yeah i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function  
maybe a little smaller than that  
um uh okay  
alright  
and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here  
yeah we were <unk> like doing this we were just concerned with the whole stuff  
yeah  
and here are is uh here is a <unk> short summary that i summary that i compiled after the findings i found  
so you can dash in there for half an hour at a time  
yeah  
yeah  
i <unk> i do  
yeah it's inside and yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
uh components  
uh  
okay  
so this factor becomes the most important factor in our <unk> uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls  
buttons  
yep something like this  
um okay  
right yeah yeah  
we like two  
but they found most remote controls very ugly  
yeah that's cool  
but it's gonna emerge over time  
those are the user scenarios  
so even they propose some kind of word error rate  
mushroom is a vegetable  
the next  
yeah  
that's possible so that you only get the no <unk> <unk> no  
<unk> <unk> does those count as <unk> active we definitely include active  
um basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one  
mm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
trend yeah  
for now  
um  
we're selling more than just the product  
ah that's good thinking yeah  
mm  
yeah we can just wipe them out in one fell swoop  
it looks like i'm also in the same position  
uh-huh  
mm  
which includes all these sort of multiple <unk> and any blinks and that sort of thing  
be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um  
even news music  
this is basically just pen practice huh  
uh do you think that's fair coming from a <unk> the manufacturing  
displayed  
did we have a lot of room for individual leadership um teamwork and the means  
no  
on the side or on the or for example on top  
the idea is great but it doesn't work properly  
it it becomes more uncertain about everything  
so um  
everybody could say what they thought  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation so uh i don't have to explain it  
no um a scroll  
uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round i think oval will be better for the for the <unk> for the different uh channel buttons  
so yeah it was my project um during my internship at <unk> under the supervision of jean marc  
<unk> this <unk> shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is the more like the the <unk> it is to get lost  
so  
well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it  
well who wants to be next  
about how often it was used  
yeah  
could you <unk> just quickly rewind  
well the titanium is strong and uh the rest <unk> uh the buttons feel soft  
um so for my earl other measures i i get them and i don't i mean i would have to look for every single write a programme that looks for everything a number and does the mapping for that  
okay  
no absorption lines  
yeah  
uh <unk> this these labels the yahoo categories that's that's a clustering  
i like it a lot  
yeah  
i know they match uh uh the layout in two x. m. l. files et cetera  
about the l. c. d. <unk> thing  
yeah  
th this is a magic one but i know we don't want to talk about that you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic  
mm  
yeah  
so  
no  
mm mm-hmm  
but i think i have to think more about what i meant  
so this is the component based evaluation he was talking about yesterday isn't it  
when you get like um someone's talking and there's they sort of pause in the middle of a sentence that's long enough for it to put a break in  
so going with the fruit and vegetable idea we've got the bright colours so makes it stand out  
twelve bucks  
then you have the case is uh whether it's flat or curved  
you could either you could have it if you have a in plastic rather than rubber then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then  
uh about the feeling yeah uh yo  
yeah  
but twenty six percent do you know  
let's go back to um now we have to make some decisions  
mm  
oh no re no i don't even remember the the you said i would tell you that evaluation should be done based on likelihood or perplexity  
the <unk> corps of the international computer science institute  
the  
uh yeah i hope i can recover this 'cause i've accidentally deleted it  
and it looks cool when you print it in font looks pretty cool  
okay and um design is simple to use simple in features  
we will jiggle around in there  
maybe too long  
what i can do is i can <unk> look into ho well pedro and i can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers  
okay we'll make it a uh pomegranate a big pomegranate  
alright  
not to spend time in like um giving several orders um i dunno  
um a little bit but uh i'm <unk> i'm not sure he knows uh everything  
with an l. c. d. screen  
but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you can just say where is my remote control  
it'll be copy of component design  
yeah  
so this is our project  
yeah yeah in the case of remote control not really  
uh radio frequency depends  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it only reacts when you press play at the moment  
right  
they're not as prominent as the main features  
with with with the charge  
mm just have a yeah  
no nathan's fine  
ah <unk> <unk> but if mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
okay indeed  
definitely in casing 'cause we have a hard plastic yeah  
um i quite like the multi coloured buttons myself  
no  
remote control  
how <unk> how long is the <unk>  
you know  
one of the four is better i suppose  
so it's it's it's really good design  
le lemon <unk>  
feature  
it has to be fancy  
yeah  
uh so we've got do we want to go with the t. f. t. idea or the is that far too expensive  
let's remember that  
it's in it's indeed beautiful  
okay okay  
the um  
i guess the other option referring to the battery thing is you know how <unk> will <unk> light up for fifteen seconds or something  
oh maybe  
mm-hmm  
or for for the series  
yeah  
wow  
and uh so i'm present myself  
yeah okay  
okay  
so our target group is you mentioned um older people  
so  
so well it is important for him to be here uh  
we should take care that this directory or in fact this directory is not <unk> you know you cannot list from outside uh with uh f. t. p. or h. t. t. p.  
l. c. d. display  
i <unk> i can talk about it but i have no slides or anything  
<unk> yes you shouldn't  
you mean these fifty per cents i mean they're all separate or  
yeah but it <unk> it was for say um say you've got someone who has you know  
and uh end  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick  
um commands and mechanisms for the operation and <unk> just kind of a variety of choices  
yeah i think half hour it's fine right  
for example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up  
um  
yeah  
i'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be  
but also kept in uh a directory in uh on m. m. m.  
yeah  
no  
okay i think my mic is falling falling  
well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the l. c. d. screen  
yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu  
six  
um this should be our priority as we've been saying  
that's just i the only button only  
otherwise you can see that if a words appear once basically it is one hundred percent related to one slide huh  
so you're saying  
the <unk> button  
for some reason i seem to have just died on this one  
for the ami project  
for the remote control  
on the product yeah  
mm  
it has to feel nice in your hand  
hey  
maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later  
i'm sorry i i don't have any pictures of uh of this thing  
so um i think we we can <unk> immediately start with the individual presentations um the progress you've made  
that was quick  
um or take out the back up battery  
yeah go ahead  
alright that makes sense okay  
mm  
true  
uh i have to see the agenda  
um testing the card with uh only one audio for instance and then only one video  
quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does  
yeah  
and <unk> so when extending the those experiments to the other meetings uh when while i was observing an improvement on the first meeting i was using  
okay  
i mean it's it's  
one minute please  
yeah  
of course  
there's some kind of communication either <unk> imaginary or verbal that plans how we're gonna do it right  
there's the functional design of the the remote control  
like  
yeah that's it  
oh it's just it's lyman alpha absorption  
sorry i was miles away  
yeah but as soon as you speak about options it means that the price increases  
yeah  
hmm  
uh well when we put in fancy colours yeah and yeah  
and third i stick with it the log in functionality uh with the slogan take parental control to a new dimension  
well no i'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh  
okay basically i just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do  
yep  
yeah yeah at least it should hold in your hand <unk> properly like  
it's just free man  
yeah  
i like bold  
basically the uh for the um i'll back actually  
hmm  
uh <unk> like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through  
i just have to there's a few little bits and pieces i have to write down but  
so instead of having an single utterance that we display it would probably be like that would be representing a whole um topic a segment in a meeting  
pen  
well think i had the best solution that i came up with is just to <unk> take out the speech recognition  
that's an a an added feature  
so  
we're doing a bit  
has has anyone actually looked at the java code for the huh  
but but you can be involve in a different way  
and then use your windows media centre under your t. v. with the same remote control  
fashion  
yeah we have still one or two minutes to talk yeah  
um it will be in program  
yeah but  
but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an l. c. d. display  
yeah  
where is the clay  
um  
mm-hmm  
okay great  
well yeah  
yeah  
um special form  
so it not not only in in the colours of the <unk> that we want something to keep it visible at all times or  
okay  
would you like to go first  
the price of selling is twenty five euros  
yes  
yeah  
is proposing something or <unk> uh then other speakers might might chan challenge him or her  
yeah and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing  
so we drop the voice recognition  
okay we will  
we yeah we'll start her all <unk> all over again  
yeah  
hmm  
we have done this  
'kay  
we could do yeah  
um let's think how they did this  
that's kinda trendy  
so you said the problem was the <unk> it the <unk> <unk> i is expecting a mono microphone input  
okay so that's basically silly  
uh yes  
no but that is what the raid can allow you to have keep up to fourteen hard disk  
and if it should improve it if you say this feature extraction process is better than you can have a better cleaner separation between those two  
with the with the yellow uh  
but okay we we'll <unk>  
yes but when you make uh uh a bit of big  
mm-hmm  
um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive uh small fairly cheap  
as as you mentioned  
um and this is what we are going to do  
yeah yeah yeah  
but i was thinking since it is useful with d. v. d.  
yeah so maybe you can hide them or something  
you put it on  
you can <unk> even keep the bag of words and do the <unk> comparison or  
so you're in a sense you're comparing the product without the company logo  
yes but a titanium remote control when you're uh watching t. v. uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty and the  
yep  
for our own remote control we have to think how do we make it  
i i suppose that's all we can do really  
okay  
so then we'll have the concepts  
and uh uh the scroll is rubber so <unk>  
yeah  
how much do we win  
do you know what i mean  
'kay  
um this can be done quite cheaply yeah  
part of that  
that's right  
it's <unk> that's recording it  
it probably would be but i don't i it's been a long time yeah since we've done this  
uh let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria  
that would be good  
'cause it's a region yeah  
well it <unk> if if you've got your sort of eye position  
okay  
'cause what would be quite cool is if on this search result you could give it each one a tool tip that had the context  
yeah yeah  
but it's just speaking  
we designed it to be good looking so  
yeah do we need buttons  
cheapest there is  
and older user think uh they will be scared of change i think  
so however i've now  
and other lights  
i haven't actually looked at this yet  
i <unk>  
well done <unk>  
mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah  
yeah  
yeah it's in your file isn't it  
and then teletext was the next  
yeah  
and should come out  
hmm  
so  
if uh i exactly  
okay cool  
yep  
the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget  
um this is about the functional design the things yeah yeah  
and these scroll wheels can also be integrated with buttons  
and so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes  
so it seems to me that we should take like the front runner scheme and the data and you should look at not front runner scheme but front runner theory and i see if you can speak to the data  
um our aims and objects of this uh which brings us to our next subject is um  
yo  
well i mean of course i mean  
just add it  
so in <unk> twenty minutes you can see at least two three posters and you can directly talk to people so  
yeah  
that's it's less than a second um  
no  
well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting  
it fell off  
yeah  
i just don't know how the l. e. d. and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely <unk>  
the temps yeah  
yeah but we're uh we're done  
so what's a breaking a power law index  
yeah but  
so  
elegant  
mm 'kay  
yeah  
we wanna have a little preview on the remote control  
no no no  
hmm  
okay  
so uh first i will present the concept of user interface  
mm  
um the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control  
mm-hmm  
like i guess an existing  
oh  
or at least uh the mistakes would be consistent  
i i guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh  
yeah  
is that a  
it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism as opposed to a sort of a free  
whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there  
see you in thirty minutes  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh what is most important in a  
so here in fact after twelve um i don't know if it's i think it's twelve frames  
and we don't really want the price to be too too high because we wanna be able to produce it  
uh yeah  
yeah  
for technology  
to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy  
it's like a gun  
but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't <unk> hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user  
um how many do <unk> do you need solar cells  
no th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people if you're looking for functionality  
um  
yep  
okay  
spongy feel  
th this part here is the joystick  
okay  
wood latex titanium rubber or other coloured types of plastic  
because uh yeah you can draw <unk> things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room  
yes  
it's on a web page that frank created about the lab  
i don't know whether there's any <unk> there should be any distance or not but  
th  
mm touch screen  
and seventy five percent of the users  
um and first of all it should be original it should be trendy and user friendly  
but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface  
<unk>  
but just to have to keep some of these goals in mind 'cause they're <unk> <unk> one scheme might let you answer this set of questions but wouldn't help you at all with another set of questions  
<unk> yes yes  
this is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed  
okay  
yeah we need to get on that pretty shortly i think  
i i think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers  
i mean there are markets and markets  
then you can evaluate how wrong you are or <unk> how close you are from the real assignment the right directory category  
and i what i really wanna do concentrate just now is is finding out the how we're gonna help um <unk> <unk> with with making progress on this  
ah that is three  
yeah this is microphone array in fact  
okay  
um well yeah but if they will <unk> but it doe does look like it does does that this is and things like that  
change the channels  
yeah  
and uh what is the the cost yes the the length  
uh  
yes i will eraser so  
yeah with some people it actually leads to some really screeching noises because they're so loud or probably the mic is so close  
i su  
and by then so it's not no problem  
the next fruit  
hmm  
double curved  
we couldn't put the fashion into the electronics  
just for  
yeah okay  
it's a scared turtle  
so  
i don't know if you want to to begin with the the explanation about the the release  
can you <unk> mail your slides as well  
and that uh problems like uh r. s. i. and uh those kinds of thing don't don't <unk> don't occur  
okay  
ah yeah  
are we using that  
okay um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here  
it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side for example the possibility of having a u. s. b. connection is definitely not viable now  
mm  
yeah  
<unk> i i think i would prefer and probably my group would prefer  
mm mm  
i assume it would cost extra but  
so <unk> why are we arriving at the number four  
that's what i have understood it to be  
no  
okay  
maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the  
yeah  
uh uh  
mm  
west or north i don't know uh  
fantastic  
just leave the other numbers away  
i think can i say it  
the circuit board  
r. s. i. um  
great  
i mean we can  
yeah you think so  
uh-huh  
and how an and we can uh start <unk> first uh com communication problems or things like that  
i would give a i would give a seven as well  
exactly  
just like this just and you just print triple r. it looks doesn't look bad it's short it's okay  
you have received the same email right  
um  
uh trendy it's also for young people and we have to just uh make it uh modern  
so do we have to include the company colour within that  
mm  
i think so  
and maybe  
okay  
with a colour a co a colours  
that seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to <unk> target this youth market um  
alright  
yeah  
you basically take the how good this page is which is x. and how good this page is which is y.  
and um so generally mm i don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household  
uh dance  
oh yeah  
the feel of the remote control is spongy  
maybe for kids kids they like uh <unk> no <unk> they like to  
yeah i guess the market researcher will tell us all about that  
yep yep not a problem  
okay thank you  
yeah  
mm  
i will be needing that image so leave it please  
mm-hmm  
fuck  
um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod  
i also play with that  
yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach but i think we might scale down the final model a bit  
so here are gonna be the program buttons  
you will focus on the component concept um  
but i i completely admit i mean i just sort of like th took that from some thing that jonathan once said about not loading everything  
yes  
oh  
okay  
uh  
and but i'd  
okay  
okay  
uh it's in current price yeah  
yeah  
yep  
'cause i could just say at um going over s. c. p. one night and just leave it going all night if i had to  
yeah  
yeah yeah exactly  
okay um  
so there are three concepts in our controller  
and so  
that will create another problem  
no let's leave it like this for the moment  
it doesn't matter  
so it's more like we are going to do <unk> individual work all in <unk> in <unk> our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way  
maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly easy to catch piece of equipment but um nevertheless  
you know one is that we want uh something that's high tech but we want it to seem easy  
oh  
even if you  
yeah  
so we need to do a product evaluation again which is probably um  
way to go  
it's in the old days we probably would have want a little if they'd been in the same room we would have had a little stereo thing in the background as backup as well just to make sure  
broken arm  
that's mine  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
i think if we're not including nebula and clouds we can't include  
well i figure if we go for l. l. c. d. we we should have the advanced  
still fifteen minutes  
okay  
'cause it took me it was about to take me half an hour well it did when i was like just going through the forms and filling in all the details  
marketing expert  
okay  
which effectively now is sort of four hours  
yeah  
but it's also designed for people of age above forty  
hmm  
yeah  
common ground i think you know  
um so we will rather beam uh the l. e. d. on the table  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
the light it will  
uh-huh  
three yeah  
okay  
design constraints are so  
so our rationale for putting them in a three person room is is that it doesn't matter when they're there and whether they're there for certain hours or not  
well just a moment  
yeah  
oh a rat okay  
maybe yeah  
could we integrate something into our remote control something like light  
that's true but that's what we stick under the menu button  
yeah  
i haven't got a favourite animal too so  
yeah yeah  
okay now three presentations  
yeah  
well uh  
yeah uh teletext  
and then sort of with that knowledge we should be able to then say okay that type of nite x. m. l. data we wanna load into it  
okay cool i am the marketing expert um so like  
so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive i think  
fabulous  
i think given that  
i think that that <unk> would be a very interesting thing  
um 'cause we're we're getting um right so i'd i need to sum up very quickly here um  
uh  
the kinetic one is uh <unk> you can recharge uh by the um  
you can add your buttons  
and i think we want to sell our product for longer than one year  
so <unk>  
just a remote control like everyone knows  
so you're saying you know they could be looking at um uh square one at this point  
something like that  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
or was it the other way around  
um so  
yeah  
yeah i know this is very old  
so i think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is <unk> like three different different um inspirations  
he's getting retarded  
oh  
yeah  
mm  
but they  
um of course  
so it's already quite a rich uh feedback  
yeah it's much more complex but  
mm thanks  
user friendly <unk> and it's also multi also multifunctional um we're gonna go over budget for one thing  
so what you find is that the pages around <unk> there's a lot of english pa speaking pages and a lot of french speaking pages  
no but i think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television  
but  
learning  
mm  
yep  
yeah  
it's just so if somebody says the the then it's just the the  
'cause it yeah i'm not sure  
in my setup it was different because i i <unk> i couldn't use the links between different sets  
so um  
ready  
lined with numbered buttons and  
so  
okay  
but i th i don't think uh the scroll wheels i had some i had some information about it too  
okay  
yeah and uh so so this is um yeah i guess this is it  
i think maybe the special colour we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different  
thank you  
that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of <unk> facility because you have to program it  
you have to have a lot of response back or at least some kind  
to this meeting  
oh right  
you know what happens after somebody suggests something  
i mean that this is really standard devices now  
i mean uh i don't know  
but i think  
that then then then you have to uh go to three digit uh log in  
because well it it doesn't tell the display which part to di which part to to display because the display has just called set selection to  
but so we'd we'd better do a test one and and listen to them scream  
more to how to get them and  
hmm  
that's that's the question  
hmm  
yep  
we were also doing a serious thing that we were stepping it by ten millisecond right  
okay yeah <unk> that's true with the price range we're looking at going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah  
which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office  
um  
because of its shell  
<unk> actually um  
uh here  
well i'm not a <unk> i'm the expert for user friendly but not for <unk>  
yeah  
yeah i just re wrote in in c. plus plus  
in the dictionary here it's one word  
you watched it a lot  
right  
yeah  
mm  
so yeah  
um but that bit  
yeah  
mm  
okay  
colour wise i mean you made a re uh was it you or uh i can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it  
no it is yeah  
brilliant  
but the and another advantage is like it's not really changing speech recognition whatever so not really changing because of the threshold so  
and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software <unk> on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that  
you know  
what <unk> what would they like to see uh on a new remote control  
'kay  
which is very uh periodic you can really see something like there is one peak and  
yes  
yeah  
um however uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things  
and then do i have a last slide  
mean  
so  
yeah maybe  
so i'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that  
yeah  
it is it's it is the job of the the the <unk> graphical user designer but you know  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's quite a good design  
yeah  
i think with the way it looks and um it is designed i will give it a two  
hardware  
so any specific questions for  
because uh if we want an l. c. d. uh window etcetera uh  
i'm not sure if it there's any trouble with it repeating  
you all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work  
you have this big uh measure which is here uh the chi two i don't know whether this is what you implement is used in the no it's  
mm-hmm  
yeah just basically doing a search through or or stuff stuff like that don't they  
save as  
is that the time scale you're thinking of or  
yeah  
and did it it did work  
yes  
<unk>  
sorry yeah yes  
that's un unrelated to this problem right  
okay so let's keep in mind about <unk> that that this last point about l. c. d. and speech uh <unk>  
so what measurements would you apply to um find out which is which  
so what does the management say  
okay  
do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason  
mm-hmm  
yeah sure no problem  
to olivier yeah  
um  
yeah you have to put it on its so it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table  
well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote  
what if <unk>  
we can put the logo on our uh on our base station  
yeah  
alright  
oh to go first  
yes  
i'm a bit lost  
okay  
what was the where's the l. e. d.  
yeah  
i think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool  
yeah and then uh i don't know if you know brian  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
but those things as long as we can get those components  
mean the very quick thing you can can have uh like this  
<unk> yes you can use uh buttons uh uh <unk> that are already uh on the remote control for double functions  
mm yeah  
yeah yeah uh uh  
designer of user interface  
i think i think the fact that you know ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
that makes sense  
twenty four  
so what is this result  
i think <unk> yeah i think one  
um you thought of some evaluation <unk> criteria  
you should you should have a black one because uh i think black is standard  
by the time you get the data it's going to take another two months if i am right the whole capturing system when it is going to come  
mm well i think <unk> five min mm-hmm  
cool  
i don't really know what how to call it  
but i think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue  
this is why you're the designer  
you find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh  
and then you could still have that available  
no it's not a mouse  
and we're having a custom chip  
yeah  
yeah  
see and then if you're working with just a topic segment in there it's the only thing you have to worry about  
well more or less  
so uh when you get this uh  
yes  
people yes  
and i'm sure the market will um uh  
um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea  
we talked about before  
not really just they have to improve it  
'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their t. v. <unk>  
plus minus plus uh  
i can add to that list of project is something that jean marc and me we have found in the literature  
no it looks  
oh okay so <unk> no hand <unk> required at all  
so i so the one so they i don't know how it happen you know such a thing like usually as soon as one fails  
yeah but anyway after i'm back i'll be still on <unk> and all these things  
hmm  
no it is on your display  
but what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive  
right  
okay  
okay  
so it's yeah  
yeah we're gonna develop our own <unk> <unk> docking station  
yeah  
yeah  
'cause transmitter would be here  
the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts  
then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design  
so  
i know it is  
but that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really isn't it  
mm  
so um so i think we can start with these two main things  
uh-huh  
the the whole point of having <unk> regular hours was to make sure that somebody was here to answer your questions  
yeah  
even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping  
yep  
play doh is very cheap  
and a trendy look well uh although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever  
titanium is very no no no but you know <unk> titanium is very basic colour  
right  
but it's a but it's a nuisance  
mm-hmm  
and  
yeah i agree  
um one thing that would be convenient for all sorts of things and which i haven't found out about it is how to do tool tips in an arbitrary way in in in swing graphic displays  
yep  
uh but but you you can extend that up even if you have a hundred categories  
so um  
solar cell  
so  
and again  
yeah okay  
as well as or <unk> or was that  
ye yes yeah  
in a group but i am willing to try it  
yeah  
yeah  
so yeah i <unk> i i i didn't think check for blinks during that  
very nice  
on the television  
do you think it is an easy task for you to it it's a <unk> relatively feasible task for you to to get just a single value per segment  
mm  
we can be happy  
and that you only have to control one button  
yeah that was a bit mean to put it in the end  
uh there was an option to use <unk> a rather simple chip but i think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements  
channel higher channel button  
then the conceptual design  
yeah  
we have let's say at the beginning there is some speech signal  
i don't know about you what do you think  
yeah  
okay  
so so the g. d. f. it's got yeah so it's it's got uh the all th the stuff on the um e. d. f.  
it depends which data you use as well because um if you use the data where they're all really high  
yeah this is cool  
so from lower you can it means while you are holding of from this side you <unk> you can have banana look or apple look whatever  
so that's another well it wa it <unk> it was an issue but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible  
and i didn't ooh  
everything from um multi switch administration of uh audio and how you can uh <unk> it uh what information you can get out of speech and so on  
and enter in the middle so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one  
and then a flat um remote control  
i think they probably ought to but uh they well  
yeah  
uh yeah  
um  
so then you will get the all the caller and other things  
okay  
and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television  
yep  
after that we are going to the conceptual uh  
no that's true  
so  
but uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use  
i'm sorry that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy  
but  
i just write i. v. c.  
no we are not very interested in  
sorry sorry  
uh  
<unk> yeah yeah  
yeah it's a three because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible because it has a l. c. d. screen  
the second one i is your system  
so  
and if you get if you apply hilbert transform on this on such a speech signal like a real trajectory  
you never know what's what's out there  
handset  
well it works pretty well  
mm-hmm  
that makes the task a little bit easier right  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
yeah l. c. d.  
i expect an industrial designer should know that  
that's gotta be very prototype  
yeah  
okay  
right  
like at the moment you can all do your stuff and i can do my l. s. a. stuff  
and it'll probably ruin their viewer  
um  
seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour so the power usage is also one one time an hour  
so the topics are necessarily trying to be different from each other  
you haven't made a <unk> okay  
ah yeah  
when you push the button the remote control gives a signal  
so i will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff  
you can select  
so you know clark and <unk> and you know that that kind of thing  
don't you agree  
yeah this for that you uh i don't remember by how  
hmm  
no no normal buttons yeah  
pitch screen settings like brightness colour or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself  
mm  
who starts  
uh the filtering must be must be done before  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
line width  
uh we're gonna skip through th  
yep  
well it would come up it would say yes right  
uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control  
yeah  
okay fine got the idea  
easy to find  
yeah we <unk> we copy all the files and there is uh just one um one parameter one uh string  
they've of this relevant type to what we're wanting to use probably three  
did uh did you guys get the email i sent you  
that we need to know where this data is and we could <unk> create a m. m. m. data video browser uh <unk> or something else  
if you want to turn the ball it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel  
okay  
you just drop the okay and the back  
this is the problem  
yeah  
then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last  
yeah almost nothing  
yeah  
it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me  
so you look at that you say oh someone told this one was very similar  
mm  
it's now quarter of four  
i mean i think that we really have two main selling points i think that our casing and the voice recognition  
well i suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it then you're not using any power either  
what about people without hand  
just build it in  
but if they give us access to it here <unk> sitting on a dice machine  
well the finance uh we'll do later so um firstly uh i'll show you the notes  
he's just transmitting all the phase and then but he's encoding the envelope yeah  
<unk>  
there's a guy studying it here yeah he's studying <unk> and <unk> or something  
and the fourth option is the solar cells which are also made by the company  
so if you're a philosophy student with um you know and your work has got an interest in language then  
um the audio uh <unk> the time stamps used there would be joint time stamps between the audio and the eye tracker so that you know  
yes yes yes  
if if if the okay  
so we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists i guess  
mm uh use it  
um  
yeah but the can we use it for saying okay channel fifty channel twenty  
team work no problem  
because the <unk> world is now changing it's trend towards organic becoming more and more organic becoming yeah  
uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess but the uh  
i if it i if it has really the model shape of a <unk> you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing  
very nice  
yeah  
no i was hoping that you guys could  
you you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies like speak uh speech recognition and stuff  
yes  
with okay  
no it doesn't have that much added value to the  
they'll probably still be there  
yeah  
'kay then the case is a  
whoop  
searches for the button  
with large mm yeah i suppose the larger more oscillation appears that um it's not <unk> i mean uh it isn't it isn't it isn't that big  
hello  
well that's a bit exaggerated  
i think there's a problem with the push push button  
and we could justify all sorts of stuff like that by <unk> in the presentation by saying we deliberately tried to keep any complexity and numbers and stuff away from people  
you can see that in the <unk> um w. point um first it's w. point um five uh fifty four and then it's seventy six  
yeah okay  
but i didn't have like information to sloth through either so  
right  
blinking at the same time as the other person was doing something i think to mm-hmm  
i think we can agree on this  
yeah  
right so we're we're <unk> we're building models  
right  
yeah yeah  
mm  
thing thing is w. g. d. s. formats is <unk> is working at the moment  
and so we're gonna do that so it will address it fine  
mm-hmm  
uh  
pens  
okay  
yeah <unk> because you have  
okay  
because that's that's just a p. l. p. <unk>  
yeah cool man  
the key a signal to a chip uh the chip senses the connection  
i'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on  
yeah i was just gonna say it would be useful to know what <unk>  
okay so next mm  
so and the first information is um about the the noise level  
our remote control  
what  
and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver  
i think if i had to do it again and we made a mistake we should have register you here at e. p. f. l.  
so you will have to model model something  
that's a pity  
but not on the screen because yeah that's uh that's an idea  
and most televisions will come with a remote  
it performs the action  
yeah  
that could be one possibility  
<unk> welcome back  
i though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid <unk>  
i like user <unk> <unk> uh uh also the best  
but people will stay will continue to say no no you will find time just to do that project  
maybe in in <unk> you know  
but in <unk> in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed and as you say at the thumb  
that was the that we the browser task  
um  
components design  
a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote  
for me i i wouldn't buy it  
okay  
oh it's not that  
how would you do that  
well  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun  
um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make  
yeah  
how do you do that  
yep  
alright well than thanks for hearing me out and the idea especially  
oh the menu button is it  
okay  
um  
one thing i like is the shape  
yeah  
so the you're uh  
we um yeah we we uh indicate the amount of components of the <unk> specific component how much we need of them  
this one eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one divided by five is four point two yep  
i'm allergic to cats too  
yeah  
although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so i dunno  
and so it's taking taking the lead from that  
um and easy to use i don't think that will be problem  
<unk> has a fixed schedule for when she's there but david and martin are sort of they <unk> it fluctuates  
yes  
yeah  
yes  
we have  
oh okay  
mm  
you're just gonna believe me we'll go from there  
on the right  
like if  
yes i think you want <unk> in there  
so i think it's so maybe there is a machine i don't know whether for this you need you know a very powerful machine and so on  
<unk> yeah  
and uh should go uh in one or uh one <unk> yeah  
why can't we stay here  
for me i think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad  
by your humble p. m.  
i've never heard of that kind before  
and you know it's a black triangle 'cause you know which mold it came from  
i think so  
i. t. v. and you're watching b. b. c. then then it might um change itself so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it  
mm-hmm  
we've got the closing  
version one  
like this if everything's okay but i first have to put it on the pen you see i'm new to it too  
yeah  
no  
'cause if it's below about 'cause i saw there's ones up in the eighties wasn't there  
the trends  
yeah yeah  
really not very little choice in that one  
can't star burst if it means galaxy  
and uh they are bad for r. s. i. but uh i don't remember what is r. s. i.  
but i don't uh do we have to stay here or i think we have to return first  
the special colour of the buttons  
but  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so if if nothing then then i could be able to get the job somewhere  
um uh i think we decided that  
they're out there  
it it's almost like having a lapel yeah  
by watching t. v.  
so this guy this is another company that provides big buttons  
let's do speech  
this is banana and mango not not purple or <unk> orange and yellow  
'kay  
does anyone know how to take it out of  
yeah  
okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy  
oh uh  
yeah  
i'm not biased  
so uh we get to know each other  
so it can be sort of held and <unk> we really need really gonna need to hold it if it's gonna be voice recognition  
but uh in fact we have a there was th yes  
yeah  
i'm sorry what was that last one  
depends on the user  
oh perhaps they can use it  
because when you have the l. c. d. onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background we are most focused on the commands  
that's right  
'kay  
yeah  
ugly  
yeah but they are built in so it's one  
there's also restrictions to when it comes to the chip  
yeah but the l. c. d. screen probably needs quite the chip  
yeah th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on screen menu of your channel choices than you can scroll down on the scroll  
yeah at least the colour would be different  
so you just  
or not  
oh whatever  
if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button so it switch ons the switch ons the t. v.  
mm sorry uh speaker unit i guess it's it should be  
mm-hmm  
that makes me think of different products than a remote control really  
yeah  
<unk> we are aiming for younger people and they they chose  
'kay  
but that <unk> that would help us be a lot more specific ab than than just um you know  
yeah  
can we see the slogan  
but you can also navigate the channels  
yeah you have basically a button menu which you can use directly uh according to the old principle  
oh i can't remember which one it is at the moment  
have you guys been saving your <unk> presentations to the okay  
uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions  
but uh without <unk> uh okay  
'cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue  
high excitation emission lines  
i it stinks because this hard yeah  
two threes  
okay  
because it's simpler  
yes  
so  
okay <unk> that's a shame  
no i think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept  
<unk> it's uh ex <unk> and uh is  
alright  
um  
i i well yeah at the <unk> yep  
th okay the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes whatever  
yeah  
and i i think in the first instance what we're trying to get into the g. d. f. format is just this  
i think yeah i think too  
yeah  
or  
mm-hmm  
you get email  
it's not a directional mic anyway  
when you you see it from the side then it would look just like that  
yep  
um i don't know if there's such a thing out there  
yeah  
what did we think of the meeting room i guess is an important thing here  
i guess we we basically vetoed that idea  
so that's one thing we're gonna work on  
and and pro and lights  
hmm  
see i would off i would offer you to to get it on this one and then um like copy it  
<unk> two  
um and as you say we need to have some kind of gimmick  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
th this looks a little bit like like for only for children  
and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection  
when i if you get 'em today when are you gonna start running  
yeah  
i think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment  
i i'm just thinking you know sometimes when there's a a process error like that you think oh then there's something we should change  
alright  
well okay well well let's make it just one  
uh i don't know what that means either  
but but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it  
yeah  
yeah  
and  
yeah  
sorry  
i think so  
yeah but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet  
yeah like they do in with cars i think  
but i think uh <unk> this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork  
oh is it  
then we have thirteen euros  
so  
and possibly also the size so more important buttons bigger si  
so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff  
yeah  
okay  
um we're not doing emission line when it's a <unk> of objects are we  
totally  
one more time  
um  
have to be really careful  
yeah of course  
or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um i don't power that might be something that we could look into  
just keep it as simple as uh as possible  
yeah  
um now the new project requirements i'll just show them  
yeah  
ah well ca i can easy i can easy get to <unk> uh to <unk> i know where it is off i used to live there  
uh yes yes yes yes  
like a few hours a day  
find out what functions are useful for us in that  
i think there should be <unk> h.  
um you can do sub optimal processing and uh for example here i'm considering all possible pairs of microphones  
so  
uh  
because  
yeah  
and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys  
m. i. s. t. e. r.  
i can address some of that issue i think with uh my presentation  
mm  
about me  
not sure  
okay  
after after that five minutes you have ten minutes to finish it or alright  
no  
i'm not thinking about to do and just repainting the thing as a whole with a moving bar that's not a good idea  
yeah it's okay  
and uh so i think for our design we want some <unk> uh programmable uh you know v. v. l. s. i. or f. p. g. a. uh high technology  
maybe a three  
that's it  
i think that there were too many <unk> in the meetings  
which  
for the case of the remotes itself um they can be a general case which is just a flat one  
mm  
yeah but but i mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote  
oh well okay  
this is  
okay  
because you don't wanna have to say um you know did they jointly look at triangle one  
the  
yep  
right  
they think it's ugly  
of  
round this corner too where the logo is  
cool  
um <unk>  
yeah  
uh should be appropriate should be good looking for the consumers  
no two for the to make it clear  
so <unk> what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the l. c. d. um  
yeah  
seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly and <unk> seventy five of the users zap a lot  
you should try it i don't know  
yeah yeah okay  
um i don't it could be a graphical display  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
so you see the big difference between the young people  
yeah  
yep  
okay  
yeah and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace  
m. d. o.  
uh in this <unk> should be looking at the construct  
adjusting  
i i've got um pictures well i've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it and they don't really look great  
what  
yeah especially on the easy to use  
alright  
when you comp uh <unk> what you com when you compress the effectively they'll want the signal which we are <unk>  
mm-hmm  
thank you  
so maybe we think we can think more about that and discuss that maybe last time next time  
i i think it's uh  
but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound say you wanna pick up the phone there's a mute button right  
no that maybe not  
okay f.  
you know we want something new that's gonna stand out  
so you must be careful with uh with uh all this  
okay  
the second important thing is uh innovative technology in the r. c.  
oh  
so some way you can add as many input as we want  
is that th  
yeah yeah exactly  
okay  
um seventy five per cent of users say they zap  
then  
um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet  
and adapt  
yeah  
okay well i put it back on  
it's it  
okay  
and then save it and start an blank document  
but plastic is i think is the most appropriate one it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's  
hmm  
that doesn't count  
next time we're here  
yeah i think it's uh because uh this technology is uh  
yeah  
you'd have to sell four million  
yeah i think you're right  
okay  
yeah  
oh  
you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion  
or something li like that  
so i prepare an excel <unk> uh an excel sheet  
from their i'll just use it from their website  
yeah  
um i dunno if you can open the uh <unk> is not here  
you said uh <unk> target groups what does that mean  
what kind of  
but um i've just indicated here we could have actually two scroll wheels 'cause i think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of  
i like it because it's fast and it's black as well so it can  
if they want to make on mobile they don't want really use some fancy really expensive <unk> expensive features or all these  
okay  
is there a way to uh to from one uh from one stream to uh to build two streams that correspond to the the voice of one people and the voice of the second  
but uh they have no uh no classification just to come up with okay so uh you mean uh  
hmm  
sure  
mm  
i feel like a robot  
right  
interface push button  
um we've got more like fifty  
it's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road you know  
'cause the thing is what a what we the <unk> this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do  
let's see  
i think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting  
so we are uh we were <unk> uh on the younger people  
mm  
i'm not not sure it's  
oh yeah finally we say no  
right  
okay  
but yeah it just re  
okay  
so yeah so this is what we do and uh that might help a lot of course  
or  
go up  
so that's something you have to keep in mind  
um in fact the the major problem regarding acquisition system is always the <unk>  
right  
i have to state which function has to be in the menu and then you have to decide  
okay  
don't choose for <unk>  
okay so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour that kind of thing  
and um an important thing here the most important customers uh  
a graphical user interface <unk> the use of pictures  
mm-hmm  
wow  
oh thanks  
it's optional yeah since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than  
well  
so given we are going for this uh  
that one isn't accurate  
yeah  
okay  
but  
ca uh if you look at 'em do you just know  
mm maybe <unk> not this one but  
uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know  
yeah so for now we'll just just assume that non <unk> non intersecting um and um yeah  
that's the <unk>  
uh will it <unk> the effects of r. s. i. which was repeated strain injury  
just change it  
right  
you think that young people that are  
but this isn't something that affects what craig programs for the initial g. d. f. translation  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
oh okay  
um  
yeah  
but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster  
yeah i was looking at the website  
and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket  
it's just not very much rep represented because you apply um a window which has this shape having window  
mm  
i mm-hmm i think so  
uh where has my screen gone  
i mean i'd give that nearly a one  
a lot of zeros  
maybe objective banana  
what about  
a at least what i can see that currently like for <unk> uh for instance if it's to do colour correction or for instance if it's too black  
but i was just wondering like as long as we <unk> that's what it'll do  
and  
okay  
and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it  
so you can what shape a person will like  
<unk>  
i've done more <unk> in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun  
guess i'd forgot how good <unk> play doh smells  
components design  
okay uh anyone any uh <unk> other <unk> of our uh remote  
uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two it might interfere with the i. r. channel  
with our fronts  
uh we might be able anyway to give you some reference  
very good  
okay  
okay  
like uh  
but the overarching idea you know  
oh we didn't think of that yet  
uh alright so what they did was they they they stopped using the <unk> and uh they're starting to use uh a gaussian there  
yeah  
well what costs a lot  
uh most of the remote <unk> uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose  
watch i'll find out he's got a better computer at home as well right  
i know the problem  
ooh i just got an idea for a design  
lines in the spectrum and you'll uh estimate  
yeah  
yep  
mm  
so it's hard wired  
yeah  
we put the fashion in electronics  
okay  
i got three seventy  
nah  
so probably i would try to try to draw the animal  
yeah  
like make the sign in bigger red letters  
yeah  
it it affects the way we do the n. x. t. <unk> up translation and make things easier for people  
do they  
mm  
um so this is my little graph thing  
well how does everybody feel  
mm no i think it's a <unk> feature  
yeah  
um there's a scroll wheel  
yeah  
but  
or it's it's done via this remote controller  
for a t. v. the most important feature which i felt was the locator which is a cool feature  
yeah  
'cause i you're not gonna <unk> have the same pixel  
yeah  
just go go for that  
i don't know who's uh who's going to look at that  
okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber robust with scroll wheel  
but you can't push it so you have to tap  
you can even isolate the directory from the categories of <unk>  
or the  
yeah  
yeah that's it you know  
we'll see <unk> next meeting  
oh  
come on my computer  
and there is a certain number of things that can be uh some way detected and measured that tell you whether the speaker is actually respecting some form of uh uh  
is it a monster  
mm-hmm  
i i i'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh  
okay and it says interface  
and i'd say that that's us for now  
okay  
but it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material  
it's something new  
yeah  
but that's  
yeah the sample sensor will have to go 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there  
yeah okay  
right  
just uh there is already a blank  
well if if you yeah  
yeah  
i think we should go with uh with the company colour because what specific info that i got from the project board  
it's just a one thing  
yeah  
yeah  
but it's not very uh very effective  
um yeah and i kind of like whales  
okay that was good  
yes  
it just saves you parsing the um  
no  
but they didn't have too much frame drops in fact  
mm  
so to appeal a little more to the all the public  
yes  
like that  
no okay this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components  
but at least i twenty seven  
yeah  
yeah  
basically in what we discussed cover and buttons will be made of rubber yellow colour black components as you can see right over here  
okay  
yeah  
well that's um yeah speech recognition and <unk>  
well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like i when i went to school in the u. in santa barbara which is central california  
uh talk about working design  
but uh  
huh  
it's usual the the the <unk> kind of the way it works  
alright  
yeah maybe  
yeah  
when are <unk>  
so it's a different way of approaching the problem which means a different way of capturing different exigencies in in capturing the the documents yeah  
yeah  
'cause i only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies  
yeah huge is a yeah  
i didn't know uh  
<unk> it's th  
yeah thanks for attending  
no uh that's true  
it's just inspiration about circuit boards  
<unk> the way i see this i is that it's uh the the <unk> the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the <unk> principle of teamwork because the the tasks were <unk> <unk> sort of um divided  
i'm afraid i have to go soon  
me too  
mm-hmm  
mm  
so julian  
ready  
like you see here i'll just take the take here  
maybe put it up put it a maybe put it on the desk or something  
yeah  
and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote  
mm-hmm  
yes  
and new ideas about new products maybe <unk> which would be fashion and uh  
so maybe you can finish your presentation and afterwards we will discuss about all this  
so maybe i will let the our two designers talk about so their you have <unk> oh sorry  
maybe not  
oh wait uh wait up  
yeah alexandre did not care too much about the way uh you i no no no but uh you are more in research  
and you didn't put on the  
remotes look like now is kind of what we're  
or would that be  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and uh we're we're using different colours  
thirteen  
no  
creates an audio file <unk> from just the chunks that we wanna have and that runs in synch with what we have in the  
oh  
because of the fruity uh fashion  
i'm still not convinced of the  
no no no what i'm saying means temp one and temp two could have been different systems altogether  
this is double curve  
exactly  
oh no  
would that you think that would help us find um a specific form  
isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal  
so we ought to be able to get that  
yeah  
uh demos test  
mm  
well when the whole thing was if it was gonna run a trial that'll give you some some screen shots to work with  
okay  
yeah um  
current colour  
yeah  
uh will contact the t. v. and will have whatever device or d. v. d. player the bulb will turn on to say it's on  
mm  
mm-hmm  
for <unk> such a phone  
of course  
you know you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the <unk>  
i agree  
and it makes more sense to do that anyway because um that means you got more flexibility with how you want to group them  
you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb  
the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control  
there's no no other words for that  
so do we need to decide on the functions now  
<unk> and <unk> who work on the same project at the bottom  
i agree  
four is fair  
we'll see  
we are building this slowly  
and the question is does the algorithm still make any sense in that i don't understand the algorithm enough for that  
yeah  
we don't wanna confuse people  
i mean it's not just like i mean it's not like <unk> you know on a normal chunky remote every button <unk> i mean means something different  
it can come in the same colour as the the case  
yeah i think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user  
okay th and this point is about testing and uh yeah  
little bit more if it's with extra features  
yeah  
i mean we'll discuss it but  
shoes and also uh products  
you know what if you can if you introduce um like a sort of a static what's it called public static <unk>  
um a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls  
yeah  
i it's basically an idea to overcome these issues because  
some  
just a couple of minutes anyway  
so do you think a tree view for like an overview of the whole set of meetings would be good  
mm 'kay  
i can i can tell you a whole lot about how it works  
no i'm an <unk> afraid not  
um and the feel of it i mean we've made this out of play doh  
yep  
okay see you  
then it automatically we can just do like you feel it goes  
could be it could be an ape or a fruit bowl  
isn't that the skimming  
okay  
light for the finding of the remote  
of course  
two  
so  
as you know before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control  
yeah  
we thought that wood would be more expensive  
can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange  
no  
and they're bad for r. s. i.  
maybe the counts <unk> <unk> been better if we had a list or more  
but i mean the th the the thing is you'd need ti it part of the parameter set for that is uh the um uh the <unk> uh the harmonic <unk>  
yeah  
it it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box so that's what i mean  
probably you have one with uh with speech recognition and  
um  
yep  
yeah  
uh the functional design the conceptual design and the detailed design um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work  
so uh also a uh two  
oh  
okay  
this is the question  
yeah  
uh-huh  
channel up and down and the control of the advanced options  
yeah special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's <unk> to the <unk>  
but uh of course the quality is uh is not so good still  
yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so  
yeah well  
do you think it's a reasonable option  
no that i yeah  
i mean i don't know how much significant can be at that level  
so half of that will be look the yeah not not the upper side  
next meeting is called the detailed design  
usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages alright  
that's yeah  
yeah  
mm  
but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people  
i <unk> i didn't in include it in my report  
i'm two  
yeah  
yeah th can't remember where i put it  
no  
hmm  
yeah  
um i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or <unk> <unk> <unk> what was your thought on the matter ron  
yeah  
on off  
uh we have available the smart board and the <unk>  
back to my uh  
so function mm  
okay  
so for our young people uh it will be cool they can be able to use it  
yeah but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion i think  
is that gonna be a button or  
it's just you know in elan it that has the side effect that if you go for the naturalistic way of of up translating to elan  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
okay  
different languages might not be compatible  
but it is a back track  
yeah  
so if you have then l. c. d. in the remote you just have a menu  
so we're just just about there  
you can uh you can convert the same thing into <unk> segmentation because there is <unk> and <unk> they are not different  
three  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
as um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because i had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance  
yes <unk> we can do that on the on the  
does somebody <unk> who was it of you two who said that um there's some programme which spits out a dictionary probably with frequencies  
yeah  
the manuals  
sure sure  
so this is where he'd like time stops  
okay  
oh yeah no no no  
um yep  
yeah  
yeah  
some extra deciding  
mm-hmm  
okay  
i think it's definitely different than anything else out there  
yeah alright  
what we think that things mean  
has some shortcomings  
about cost  
i don't know  
that's something  
take a harder look yeah sure  
yeah  
and do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven so if it's neither true nor false then that's four  
that must be really weird  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so matthew we were uh yeah  
um at first i tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things  
well i think uh <unk> we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes  
yeah i think uh  
yeah what was uh on the  
<unk> more representative of our colour scheme like the company the yellow and black  
yeah because it <unk>  
this is uh the box that we have on the table  
that is the one on the left  
yeah  
uh make it a little different than the traditional ones  
put it in there uh wire on it  
yeah  
the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros  
okay  
do we have any confirmation do we actually see from this file who's doing it just out of interest  
we're going to make this an international product marketed in the states in europe in asia  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah  
scroll wheel integrated scroll wheel push push button or l. c. d. display  
yeah <unk> what about a yellow thing i mean it  
okay  
i don't know  
well i like that design  
that doesn't account for this  
mm-hmm  
well i haven't done math in years  
material  
but um for using it as uh recharging it but also for using it as sound recognition  
yeah yeah  
do we know about chairs tea and stuff  
not  
what's the difference between a simple and a regular chip  
well we work together on a project but everybody has his own task  
oh right  
we don't have it we do have it it's just sold as a package  
now we have to decide what controls do we need  
the variance is mi it's is minimal  
i mean the the colour of the background of the display  
well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part  
really  
these are the <unk> two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
ah yes that's the power source  
the first is that it is fuzzy  
so  
so this was one part of experiment so single stream and then i wanted to combine deltas with this and have another table so that was why  
how you call the festival so you can just give the full there is an too  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
here now it's now it's already <unk> shall we just  
okay  
and yeah <unk> is busy with uh annotations plus all kind of things  
but  
yeah  
in my display  
and i will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new <unk> project product  
um but uh still uh in some of the <unk> these videos for instance even if we <unk> go now if we want to  
yeah that's fine  
yeah  
we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here  
yeah and also in the in the <unk> lab labs the <unk> people didn't know anything about it and they just follow the papers  
okay  
yes  
yeah  
right  
i think yeah it's gonna you know come up <unk> you know  
twelve fifty  
that's actually good idea so  
what do you say  
uh among them design uh <unk> <unk> how <unk> did they like the use of it uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls  
oh  
great  
titanium  
<unk> because <unk> especially with chi two square it <unk> the amplitude it's much bigger than with <unk> right  
what we're in  
so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon  
so <unk> twice every once every two hours  
and we have two fifty per cent people who are half time in geneva half time at the e. p. f. l. in lausanne  
um  
yeah  
oh  
or we can <unk> <unk> we could put 'em behind the flip flap or whatever  
it could be some kind of knowledge what the uh speaker knows or or some kind of thought what the speaker is thinking  
so if we go for the simple push button so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we  
looks like a ipod  
um so here's you know a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me  
so we're going to work together right now  
to <unk> co communicate it's just a thing  
mm-hmm  
so  
yeah  
oh that's just great  
mm-hmm  
so you you said you did it in python yeah  
i would also say three  
a disco version  
yeah  
they're actually very slow in its techniques  
you mean a smaller context instead of this  
mm-hmm  
and well the the electrical cable is just normal uh  
<unk>  
okay  
it's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red black and yellow and orange  
because if you give them a <unk> uh colour  
because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area  
yeah  
yeah this is this a radio transfer thing  
master  
yellow  
that might be the  
because still you can check if you have some ambiguities you are not sure you could  
um  
so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons  
so let's start with the  
yeah  
i'll go with two  
okay  
yeah  
and we can drop these two  
yes  
so well the approach is that uh  
so we will have something like this  
yeah  
so i think they are bad  
yeah  
because it's quite funny to have a <unk> male speaking at two hun two hundred um  
oops  
so i mean that's just an idea if you guys like it  
um but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to <unk> uh come up with  
nobody's making any changes to the actual data on line  
a banana  
okay so we drop the speech  
uh the  
it it marks the end of each segment  
and that would lead to an advanced yeah  
it's gonna be very difficult for anyone to really see how much the work that they're doing is making sense because you just well i guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual x. m. l. <unk> files files that you create  
so the keywords are primary co colours <unk>  
<unk> do you agree  
that looks pretty spectacular  
so look at these questions  
oh no it's fine you're i mean you're project manager  
what percentage are they looking at the construct  
we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the <unk> things that you would do all the time  
mm  
like so i can use my home machine  
speech recognition is quite  
that would save zero point two euros compared to no  
'kay  
and <unk> and should ni look nice when you put it on a table  
to so you have applied the shot detector to some of the <unk> video or at least one and uh so we can basically maybe just comment on on this  
could drop the speech recognition  
double click it  
mm  
mm that's what i've been doing so far  
oh  
you yeah <unk> how do you call it  
i also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition  
and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something  
uh well i think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the t. v. set  
where people were complaining that sort of in the middle of the afternoon they just wanted somewhere to go off and  
right so we're meant to finish up in five minutes  
i don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a  
if if there is one word that appear once all over the meeting  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
ah  
it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was  
well we have to make a decision now that's it  
so that's what <unk> is doing right  
yeah  
um  
it's usually a context problem because i think sometimes if it's not intelligible you either tend to because you really want it to fit the context  
mm-hmm  
okay everyone's ready  
so we remove uh that part  
i can't remember exactly when it was  
that doesn't help  
change volume or channel or something like that and push to  
and um with many more <unk> and can open and close the the bottom part  
then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit you know like a different fruit for each device  
great  
oh i must admit i hadn't um i'd i'd missed that  
this is the  
so we can keep that in mind for designing <unk> uh the device itself  
button yeah  
i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number  
yeah  
yeah yeah i mean uh plastic uh is plastic also has that cheap feeling to it  
so you know about this compression how how does it why it's okay  
yeah you have make an slogan is quite obvious  
mm-hmm  
it's the bigger r.  
um and the number in the second brackets is how much it occurred in the rest  
well on a screen  
so looking at their code i mean uh so you said you would look at this right  
real reaction and such  
it  
for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their t. v. <unk>  
yeah but that's yeah  
how that relates to a remote control i don't know  
yeah  
um to try <unk> of sync it all up  
save it in save it in the uh my documents  
but it's going to be less flexible with the features especially things like uh voice activation  
yeah  
sorry  
to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one and to to be <unk>  
now this isn't a very good overhead but this is just to show you this is the innards of a remote control um  
okay  
yeah seven  
yeah special colours fruity colours  
um  
yeah next  
mm-hmm  
it mm okay  
<unk> no  
the hell  
see i have to explain  
<unk> could we have look  
but what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool that's that's different  
that's we did earlier anyway  
would you like to feel it yourselves  
well i'm more into the technical aspects of drawing so i'm not really good at drawing animals but uh the animal which i oh  
well maybe that's possible because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing  
that's right  
that's the place where it's going to be not the size  
mm-hmm  
so different uh rows in this table are showing different level of noise and also clean speech and different columns are showing different kind of <unk> or gamma <unk>  
yeah  
'cause you are talking about another component like another piece of hardware  
so you were were working on instructions for doing hand <unk>  
so what does that mean swedish um  
maybe <unk> again they do d. c. t. or k. l. t. or they do that  
um so now that um that is underway um  
okay yeah  
yeah  
some in red some in rather than all in black or you know which four do you want as long as it's black  
so these two are recent and and this is <unk> quite old  
um the monkey um  
yeah  
well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to  
okay  
no they won't be  
all in twelve euros  
i've also made notes of the previous meeting and um i was about to send them you but then uh i had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh  
it's um you have certain categories and you measure which words um have the highest information for one category  
uh-huh  
you know so something heading towards that  
um <unk> hang on  
but basically different colours bright colours not black too dark  
but i think the communication with the television is difficult  
right  
it's either or  
fairly regularly there's at least one or two people in there  
okay  
okay  
yeah but if it's only to find uh one of set you have to find some <unk> some examples  
yeah the to implement some spongy thing maybe we can do it in the in the docking station  
and what a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit can maybe hide it in the base  
mm-hmm  
well they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product  
interface concept  
<unk> <unk> i th uh  
okay okay okay  
you take you take three quarters of them away it starts to degrade but it's still intelligible that sort of thing  
a and it says so i mean based on this work do you figure out uh a direction if they guess correctly  
hmm  
but in electronics i think it's not <unk> always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates  
oh yeah <unk> it's just like there there's like audio skimming and there's displayed skimming  
yeah but i think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and  
sorry  
mm-hmm  
mm 'kay  
so then i had a look at new products that are on the market  
hmm  
one <unk> one scroll wheel so and the vocal chord it's fine  
two or three  
when there is motion you will see a lot of things changing so by using an l. r. t. t. threshold  
uh uh when i did my masters um i took uh s. p. one and s. p. two with simon king  
yeah sure  
well <unk> five to ten it would be feasible  
but doesn't matter doesn't matter  
so we have titanium  
mm  
so  
<unk>  
i i also think about uh another problem  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
the details of the <unk> design as you can see there what we have is the board main board of the remote control  
mm-hmm yeah  
yeah the button options and the l. c. d. options  
most people do yeah  
and uh what else  
well yes  
okay  
and then the other ones are just a matter of just going just <unk> further  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
exactly exactly  
yeah  
you can use this screen instead of the big se screen instead of use the yeah  
it's okay  
yeah  
and um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve euro fifty  
well uh <unk> nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel  
alright  
okay so i think you should  
mm  
uh-huh  
so in the information that you've been supplied how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l. c. d. looks  
think it's ten minutes left  
mm-hmm  
um do you wanna start again  
that we got  
see  
there's usually a little thing in the top right for the oh hang on it's just coming on  
right  
okay  
concern about our market  
okay  
pitch  
dave if you'd like to uh  
i think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it so  
and and the price  
i'm going to draw a butterfly because i saw a butterfly yesterday that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving  
yeah but it's it's special colour is it  
um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off channels volume um  
and that's why i like the dark <unk> <unk> dark colour bit you know  
that's true  
yeah  
do we want this thing to be able to be found easily  
so the power the battery in that sense maybe you have one or two <unk> strategically placed lights that sort of  
uh  
i mean  
yeah  
nice  
yeah  
i mean fancy has has a lot of  
mm  
so  
advanced chip on print right  
controls a chip  
yeah the we can wait at least one or two weeks for this because it's  
yeah  
let's pass  
yeah sure  
yeah  
yep  
mm-hmm  
so i <unk> i guess this is a case of craig writing some scripts so robin having some ideas about what the relationship is and saying  
yeah  
maybe maybe it's a three though  
i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages  
yeah i don't know  
yeah  
okay yeah  
so <unk> so none of us have been to this before  
but  
mm  
oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know  
okay right  
the user interface  
okay  
yeah  
so  
no ne never install  
it's so so <unk> you have to decide how how you will you know put some energy inside  
i think it's quite fancy  
um furthermore uh  
yeah  
to compensate  
uh it's a british thing  
alright  
no  
you have to actually stare at that bulb and go okay when i push this button is it working  
wait  
excellent  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
right  
so  
uh hopefully it by then it will be protected and and everything right  
so again most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls  
some way is always driven by <unk> what you're able to do  
this is not hard clustering  
a low cost  
and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends  
that's  
we did a pretty nice job until now  
well uh no uh i will actually give her the the option  
i didn't really hear that  
you <unk> uh file save as the j. peg j. peg  
older people like dark colours and simple shapes  
does anyone want to see uh steve's feedback from the specification  
right  
but is it in a sense it's <unk> um mutually exclusive  
it's strange i mean maybe you play yeah if you play the the video well <unk> at the beginning i don't know what's happening  
do you <unk> it's another kind of browsing page  
exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that i think  
<unk> inspiration is  
i'm afraid you're all sacked  
mm-hmm  
and since it's not kinetic it doesn't have to flip around that much  
we have double curved  
oh what  
yeah then you you paint it in the colour you want it  
thanks  
it's fudge yeah yeah  
yeah these are new ideas like glow in the dark or something like that  
that's cobra  
so um the you know it's something that we can look at but you need to what we need it's more important than knowing  
what they would really like to be part of this new one at all  
why  
nice product  
so  
mm-hmm  
so decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it  
yeah  
yeah it it has to work with a <unk> yeah well i think it's a stupid question  
so there are um this number of utterances of other speakers in between  
yeah <unk> that thing there  
and i suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber  
uh right right  
yeah  
yeah  
so you have questions  
okay  
but  
yeah  
it's it's not for the trendy thing of it  
and uh i will do the minutes  
i just got blank ones and  
are simply words  
so n. probably should be <unk>  
that's gonna be double curved yeah  
<unk> no no uh uh  
um  
mm-hmm  
and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet  
yeah  
mm  
yeah okay  
mm  
um what about um the teamwork aspect  
well the technical functions  
so i am using the t. v. so  
did we decide against the apple because of apple mac  
mm-hmm  
that's gonna <unk> is that gonna need a better chip as well  
yeah  
yep  
like <unk> within each um when you go along the the the <unk> the one second sort of segment of the band you  
right well so you'd have to produce as part of this exercise  
no no no  
or i don't think that's very good no we'll never get away with that we'll get a bad score  
so so it's just a matter of adding these the two mouse pointers and the um two gazes as extra objects  
um let's see what we can do as far as that goes  
we can like the price to create it will be significantly less  
yes  
that's what i've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation  
um i don't know if i  
yeah  
yeah  
i quite like that colour that you're fetching there it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better  
but it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that hasn't it  
uh rubber <unk> makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour  
okay  
what  
the thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are  
some t. v. <unk> will have the option of like living room style movie style  
yeah  
and accordingly you can just increase or decrease  
yeah it's your job  
joe has uh produced another version of the uh model builder and put that up  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i'm not sure  
<unk>  
it's it's not <unk> it's clear it's not perfect but <unk> it's enough to to to use it for for different purposes and uh  
it's <unk> together nothing more than that  
where is that  
<unk> does anybody have any initial ideas  
yeah  
uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel so i can uh i dunno so i can zap to my uh  
yes  
and  
mm  
in a separate button yeah  
but basically it was made without any specific know without thinking we want to recognize just to have them  
and it was uh uh <unk> not easy to use  
mm mm  
uh don't know  
mm-hmm  
yeah um  
yeah  
so i think maybe fewer buttons which also make the design look sleeker i dunno  
the  
we said plastic or rubber  
and the second which should be that carrier should be something like this  
'cause i think they can be plastic  
can i ask are we designing a remote control for a television only um and if if this device is just to be used for the television  
okay  
then we have the the user interface  
and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design  
yes  
if you know what i mean  
oh yeah  
yeah  
um  
yeah yeah  
'cause then <unk> like people who don't wanna ever look at them  
you may almost want to dis uh um i <unk> uh uh uh yeah uh <unk> use the white board  
but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down  
it's just yeah yeah  
you know give me give me what's happening every x. seconds  
so maybe you can tell us  
yeah i opened the c. d. rom box  
yeah you can't  
the chip is is not really  
and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it um because you'd need to know all the <unk> specifications of a all the like electronic companies  
but i don't want to  
yeah  
the second key feature is that uh <unk> circle channel um selection  
yeah  
yeah <unk> very fancy trendy  
someone's gonna have fun transcribing that now  
yeah just like uh the phones the  
sorry  
yeah yeah  
that's seems most straight forward  
yeah  
nah name  
i'm gonna use some different colour now  
of course  
yeah  
and uh if you are a french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french  
yep  
yeah like i mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here  
because i don't see how anybody but a person watching this can guess why they cast off this thing at this time  
but you know <unk> <unk> i mean i can see why <unk> <unk> didn't wanna spend his time <unk> <unk> <unk>  
mm  
oh neat  
so where we will go now  
and i've done it twice  
all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort  
um  
i think i think we've worked  
may uh paint uh next  
you will be working on on  
yeah and i <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
shall i see if i can get across without just tangling everything  
i mean intuitively of course you tend to use more the words that are on the slide  
it's okay but that's yo <unk> mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition  
uh i think that  
but the television would be the display that things like that usually <unk> pop up on a <unk> like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness  
uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control  
now  
another colour  
too confusing  
okay  
first you have to encode this then the l. p. c. coefficients and the residual after l. p. c. fit if you like  
function  
oh  
yeah then yeah that's right  
english from now on  
oh it's a side view  
yeah i th  
what else  
the last presentation  
yeah i reckon actually if we make a copy of it  
yeah  
i guess it's three three three  
that's just below  
make it <unk> uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood  
no  
but but maybe you can you can do just a two step process first one you have this uh unsupervised task over both p. l. and p. u.  
yeah  
i've never done it but i'd imagine it must be quite easy  
uh 'cause it has to be <unk> <unk> yeah components design that's it  
am i looking for in data manager  
uh i'll i'll do that  
oh i see i see  
well how do we collectively move on with it  
lunch  
yeah it's got the cherry and the <unk>  
but that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh  
at two point four  
oh okay  
i lost my banana  
yeah  
so i think it's better to keep it with l. c. d. screen  
yep yeah  
well i i yeah  
the <unk> the main problem is how <unk> how frequently do the fashions change  
and that is is that really fair though  
mm  
um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
you ma can make an an <unk> extra gold version  
i can't see it fitting in  
i mean that there might be  
oh  
and absorption shouldn't be marked yep  
so let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea  
what <unk> what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control  
they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel  
and and the components are very uh very cheap  
so you go inside the get frame function you see where it i it saves it  
it's only for television i thought  
yeah  
yeah  
i know what a teaser ain't it  
and then the detailed design just more in depth get the actual <unk> of the remote  
you say three  
now where do i put the  
cool  
uh  
if you yeah  
um  
that's all that that scheme is gonna do  
uh not al almost uh the uh the the uh the complete application  
okay so we'll touch screen and the battery focus on um uh presentation  
yeah  
i don't really know  
but <unk> like just normal light  
uh i know that <unk> you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping  
but they all have this this feature of this uh  
oh right okay  
i'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause  
yeah  
uh one that everybody wants uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company  
i i think it's like the engineering versus user  
we're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria  
yeah  
it will be no not before april two thousand six anyway  
current systems  
a speaker and uh  
yep  
uh we didn't no  
but  
uh there is a thing  
you know a small l. c. d. joystick  
but it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent  
so yeah  
and in that way we could probably use the same algorithm and just like make <unk> like one or two ifs that say okay  
okay i see what  
silver  
no but  
about ten pounds  
uh-huh  
i'm a very bad drawer  
okay  
so and it it's not that expensive  
i'm drawing triangles but  
yep  
yeah  
yeah but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile  
right okay  
'cause this way i can more easily flip it  
that was it  
um now claire that's the other thing she can deal with the psychology  
oh that two two kilo bits per <unk>  
but i mean the yell yeah <unk> <unk> ugly though depending on the  
now we get to do the budget numbers  
like you know hi <unk> remotes not just television and these things  
well well  
channel settings  
i think we we can go  
yeah it's true yeah  
i think it th <unk> we're talking the the functional design is more your  
banana man  
so if you have questions  
uh i don't know  
what's that all about  
yeah  
i mean um what other options would you have  
<unk>  
but so it tries to put if you it tries to uh quickly put things uh if this way that so that and but only thing that only one has the mm um backup  
the <unk> the  
mm  
'kay we have one of those  
okay um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu  
uh well it would be good reason for petra that i have to stay here  
well it's it was very democratic  
uh it's nice and <unk> it's nice and bright  
yeah  
again pretty low i mean it's the top three but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important  
okay  
it's <unk> if you sell this controller in france it can <unk> french  
i see  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay cool  
one is about how to take the decision that somebody's active or not  
okay  
yeah sort of second uh  
so special colour you want three in there  
bananas everywhere  
um i i'm not saying there's no need for an l. c. d. display but um it's what's what what would it tell the user  
is that right dave  
mm-hmm  
everything <unk>  
just just  
okay  
so even if they are only watching four or five channels  
oh yeah  
please bear in mind this is only a hundred people so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five  
'kay about one more minute  
<unk> uh not to give too many options and and if possible uh the buttons should give a <unk> direct action not first select  
just using a perl script  
oh yeah regions and stuff yeah  
to fill in yeah with all kinds of parameters  
yeah  
and you can so how are we gonna tell when for example you think we're gonna have to do human coding on when two sub constructs are put together  
like  
there was a little delay in the bit of a <unk>  
well i thought it was i thought it was i thought that people wanted previews on their i'm not sure if that even possible  
so  
everything agenda  
the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing  
but uh if you have not the time and the possibility to do it because you you both are involved in many other things  
and johanna and i and and you as well are gonna contribute to that  
because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to  
um  
the <unk> a bit i think it's it's a one yeah  
<unk> yeah just just sub menu  
yeah  
a beagle  
mm-hmm  
thank you everybody  
well that that that's one possibility okay  
and then it's transformed through the mouth that's the usual model  
this bit too far  
do we want a scroll wheel or do we just want <unk>  
okay  
we we don't have <unk>  
uh and a and a good uh zapping range  
yeah  
where are they  
you know something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often  
uh rubber is i think uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh  
not in all cases that's the problem which people are facing  
and it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system like a  
of play doh yeah  
yeah  
mm  
i want i want to market it as exclusive  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
and so that uh uh well <unk> furthermore you you we uh checked uh the cases  
yeah okay but easy <unk> not not the most easy to use i think  
wow  
it uh oh it's in the background  
but i'm still worried about what the uh effects are for analysis  
anyway you could add on for an extra package  
you too  
well that brings up something interesting because i think probably what we should do is try to get  
mm great  
i agree  
i i uh i would prefer uh both uh too  
so basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later i mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um  
move on  
i i it appears in the new <unk> uh like uh suddenly the th th the new part lights up sort of thing and it's there  
triple r. dash  
um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control  
okay  
but i think that's a part of it  
oh this is terrible  
no it doesn't  
hmm  
uh that's just uh  
it may need more actually so <unk> you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that  
yeah  
go right ahead  
the only th  
mute and then these are the numbers so our channel and our volume will be on either side  
good job good job  
so will that produce basically an agreement and a disagreement score for every dialogue act  
yeah  
with rubber we could uh <unk> pretty much shape it the way we wanted it but we cannot add scroll wheels and we cannot add an l. c. d. screen  
mm-hmm  
okay yeah  
hmm  
'kay  
mm-hmm  
and then give it a twenty minute break perhaps  
yeah but how did this how does that with a l. c. d. screen  
later  
right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like d. v. d. player and so you can i've  
well my question is what would the scroll wheel do  
i think <unk> <unk> rolls royce might mind but don't worry  
um round  
and so  
yeah  
<unk> within reach  
today functional design phase  
um eclipsing i don't think  
yeah yeah  
okay  
something we could use with one hand  
i mean the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work  
um as long as it's clear from the subject bar that it's relevant to them and that it says somewhere that  
right  
yeah  
yeah  
you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay  
alright nathan take it away  
you have an artistic uh inner middle  
so i don't think it's um we have something to do  
cause that you know that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type  
yeah save in the folder  
yeah at least on paper  
are you guys second years or first years  
i think it's still in my own documents folder  
right  
'kay  
my uh okay have it your way  
that part is also there  
uh one thing that i thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote just kind of as a fun gimmick  
amount  
mm  
um i guess i try to define like what we're doing now try to define what we're trying to get done  
yeah plastic coat  
mm-hmm  
what about uh the finishing of the case  
uh  
yeah  
uh a wide range uh sender receiver so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room and the <unk> still be changed  
to make electricity  
those five which i mentioned and then menu and then  
help also  
uh  
yeah  
so i just could <unk> use the files as they are  
yeah  
okay let's  
after that we have thirty minutes of individual work  
stick to the colours yeah  
okay  
my name my job  
okay right  
okay  
so so  
so to to sum up um  
i'm just gonna tick yes  
right  
try and come equipped with a list of the kinds of things you want out of it and and so we can look through and see  
one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product  
yeah maybe yeah perhaps you're right  
i think so  
heavy  
any device which wants to send a packet has to <unk> to <unk>  
it's a  
remotes  
um yeah so something to sit on for now  
does anyone have any initial thoughts  
mm-hmm  
uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control  
but i'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like  
yes  
mm  
oh  
computer ourselves  
in the market yeah  
point two euros  
i'm hungry so do it after lunch  
creativity  
yeah  
but um we don't we also don't want um to burn too much of your time recording stuff that that nobody's ever gonna look at necessarily  
mm-hmm  
could be everything  
so as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control  
yeah  
the disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime energy saving  
yeah it is it is i yeah  
yeah  
oh  
nee  
like just a list of the words that maybe a list of the words with the frequencies or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically  
well there we go  
so what's the absolute latest  
so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have  
so we can't attach some type of information to the word just to the word string itself  
like somebody's writing on the white board or i mean the <unk> meeting actions they presented at the review seemed really low level to me like somebody stood up  
but you've gotta think who our target market is because i i'm not our target market  
mm-hmm  
well let's let's this product  
yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
um  
you like both  
and and try to change the spec so it it reflects this and maybe um oh maybe by that point there will be some sample data or something uh and the right thing to do is for us to look at the <unk> the spec the way you understand it now and some data  
like jiggling around in the area of a particular object right  
it's not uh <unk> uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with  
yeah  
simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper  
they disliked the look and feel of current remotes controls  
and the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate <unk> uh uh automatically  
yeah  
no it's not flower power  
<unk> uh let's say for example you have uh r. t. l. five on on channel five  
okay  
the most important things we have to uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
actually  
so  
relevant options are of course power buttons  
oh that's a pity  
there's lots of space for it um  
ah  
um more interesting for our company of course <unk> uh profit aim about fifty million euro  
gosh  
there we are  
not at this point  
right you're right there  
yeah and even if we drop three buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments around here  
so as far as we know um a single function television remote control is us usable internationally  
no no you have to store a minimum number a reduced number of parameters  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so it would be curved single curve  
well as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device like t. v. or v. c. r. or d. v. d. player etcetera  
to make the like titanium panels  
yeah well and in little characters you say yeah but not too much  
i thought it said uh yeah television remote control  
otherwise <unk> data will start the first thing is to get lo lost  
yep  
yeah  
i'll try to  
vegetable textures and all this kind  
that's cool  
um  
so that mean that we decrease uh the the quality  
right so <unk> i you <unk>  
yeah yeah  
um right it doesn't matter whether they're um convex or concave in funny ways  
mm mm mm  
<unk> gone now  
yeah  
so  
um when will yeah but no i'll i'll create a <unk> i'll create a convex part um just so next week um <unk> yeah  
well <unk> you're not you're not carrying transmitting that at all really at this point in time  
i'm not sure  
uh if you that's all right  
yeah  
um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts  
oh so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the  
yeah  
yeah  
i was just wondering if that's the um  
okay  
so the real media is uh yeah a parallel thing that from the a. v. i. you convert it into real media and it is done on windows  
amazing if we did  
hmm  
apparently  
um i know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes  
and uh and of course the channel changing buttons  
my mistake  
no  
yeah  
we could use for the case material plastic  
so this has implications for data storage right  
mm  
so i should talk to him about this  
always so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes  
shoot  
huh  
alright  
and then finally you have some idea  
yeah you can keep the global <unk>  
and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out  
but i i mean as um the start uh start times um start for each meeting at zero  
ajax  
so and the next slide it is the last one it's so it's  
i don't know who you see about that though  
yeah i don't see how we could make it any more  
okay  
yeah but no that's <unk> it's not relevant  
he was from australia right  
they make uh recognition for these samsung phones and yeah  
um okay so do you think since we  
maybe yeah maybe it can be one of those if you press down and hold  
mm-hmm  
mm  
mm yeah  
yeah that  
so finance  
but it didn't work  
or if it sometimes it sounds very clear as a word itself but then wouldn't make sense at all  
these clocks aren't uh <unk>  
so we have to go out  
go to a channel  
well that's a really good point because i think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate  
no yeah  
i mean we have to make  
right well  
how  
this is your time to shine  
five  
yeah  
only the same information  
so which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models  
this is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here  
yeah  
that our company uh developed a <unk> a seven <unk> seven fingers or i'll just yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
pop uh pop up the champagne  
and then construct that  
no but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls  
yeah  
no  
'kay so <unk> where is the remote control  
th that looks like it  
together  
my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design  
just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting  
weak continuum  
yeah busy job  
but there is one thing which limits the customers like we are having only two three designs  
yeah there's good news  
but it's better like once you have like whatever the back end  
yeah  
i don't see any power cables here so  
i got my fresh and <unk> fruity uh picture uh also uh over there so  
anyway  
but um we didn't have anything small enough to write  
and then like i oh th doh  
a touch screen uh probably uh even more  
<unk> maybe  
yeah alright  
the younger group  
so yeah  
so if we were to select the l. c. d. screen the transmitter here you can see the light i  
um and just write down i'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five c. d. <unk> along with you name one of them that you could  
which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology  
well we uh we'll see  
yeah well it would be nice to that  
if we we're i mean i'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available  
it's just got the essential functions of the t. v. changing the channel play stop volume  
or  
purple  
well  
you can have flux  
no  
but  
ah  
maybe not no wood but i mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know  
okay  
because i suppose we need to do research to have something working  
it no  
and the price is fairly cheap for this  
and whether it would uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's it's a se it's my priority this one  
mm-hmm  
but uh um and in controlled places you can't just assume it's it's you know any energy below a certain threshold  
if whether they're looking at the objects than whether they're looking at the gaze  
i don't know  
alternatively we'll have like the whole thing running already when we do the presentation and we just arrange it manually  
mm  
mm-hmm  
well uh let me set this up  
oh  
yeah what's your favourite animal  
um  
yeah it's it's not the simplest  
<unk>  
it wasn't on mine either  
until you get the oh microphones  
yeah yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
microsoft <unk> right  
oh i only use it to draw a rabbit so can't say much about it  
um we looked at uh the the trends  
yeah  
oh hit f. eight again  
yeah  
take a clean sheet first  
oh right  
oh actually we just have a plastic case then we lose two points which gets us um  
yeah  
and i will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end  
this is what the finance department has told me the c. f. o. but i don't know  
it's  
yeah i don't know about the special colour but i think <unk> uh  
so it's something like hand dynamo robot  
yep  
um let's see um supplements  
no  
in indoors  
um i'm glad you could all come  
yeah well i guess that could be uh adaptable  
yes go and finish up and i'll see you at lunch  
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  
no i think they were ten percent each  
um so  
but i <unk> the talk yeah standing up in front of it and pointing to things  
yeah two  
yeah i think so  
right  
uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the <unk> channel programming and uh volume  
which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site  
last year on one of the <unk> he had like five papers right  
the so um i th i think it's great to have the records and that's really important  
just out of curiosity this narrow and broad band that that refers to the type of <unk> that you have  
what's the back <unk> <unk>  
it's just time consuming so we uh have to go on  
light only button user ca user interaction  
and we got reports from paris milan on new fashions  
mm-hmm  
there you go  
th there was the the restriction that if we cover the le the table with <unk> uh some won't be visible because uh you have uh yes  
hmm  
i always do that leaving it in my coat and then like using a different coat  
i have an idea  
alright so i don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if i'm the only one who is  
yeah i don't know  
uh i i think it's a great idea  
yeah  
yeah very nice  
they're not used often so  
yeah  
so is it  
okay i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time  
yeah but not sure  
unique ones  
like if you want it on yeah  
okay  
okay  
yeah then you <unk> then you only have one half left  
this is not a public uh public uh presentation  
and nebula shouldn't be marked  
so  
and that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end  
mm  
yeah  
no  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
spelling  
yeah  
you know conflict with the one you are trying to use  
so we've got spongy feel buttons as well have we  
mm-hmm  
then  
but i also have heard about them not working well or not well co <unk> and you wind up working with this one for <unk> this three and then this one over here for another  
it's just  
i will give a a five  
but yeah most of the time the buses are really crowded  
it does not consume much power  
some kind of a ring some  
are we having it that it's any angle or is it just  
'kay  
the constraints do come in very fast  
well i can tell you them uh from my laptop  
yeah but the  
we can better uh draw a design on this  
i don't think there's any rules about it yet  
yeah  
it's it can it does have it's problems as well  
um i think we might just get away with for the whole project just like looking at only one series and just doing within one series  
for i've got two weeks of that <unk> four lectures and four labs  
as long as the format in which we pick it up is a format which could be <unk> to a finer take  
we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell  
good  
<unk> new ideas found  
hello  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's true  
yeah  
eleven fifteen  
yeah but you do the speech coding so do you still use it  
uh more <unk>  
is uh  
well i should make it an hippo now  
so yeah i feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know fill in the blanks on your own level of creativity upped  
so  
they won't know until after they bought it  
uh one a. m. or p. m. of posters  
with different pen widths  
and you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this  
unless you kinda get right  
only one  
yeah  
which includes um an emphasis on making the infra red very functional so that you don't have to travel around a lot  
no no no  
you can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen  
um i think we're still well within our  
mm uh  
mm-hmm  
no  
click on yes  
uh hmm  
yeah  
now question is how do we do this  
yeah yeah  
hmm  
for channel surfing i think a scroll an actual like an <unk> kind of scroll thing would be too fast i dunno  
mm first of all um it's the biggest share the biggest audience sixty five percent  
<unk> <unk> i know what you're thinking  
okay  
this is the the menu i was uh looking uh at  
uh so  
okay  
slightly more than two so  
the toronto district school would only use his macs with their kids  
uh that's about it  
then it's just apple so sort of uh yellow apples though hmm  
yeah i think we're a good team actually  
yeah  
well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote  
um yeah hidden way  
simple  
'kay so far i've added what i think or what is going on  
yeah  
only twelve euro fifty i think uh we will make it  
likelihood of the uh like this likelihood is uh this error estimate of the residual  
oh  
yeah  
so  
yeah  
no  
alignment or you know  
we have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape  
yes  
yeah  
maybe they have got um the minus in the code as well and then something in is messed up  
calculation unit or c. p. u.  
okay so question number two was is it <unk> technologically innovative  
oops  
because of thing yeah well you can at least make it curved again  
up to the designers  
drawing goes with uh this thing  
go up  
yeah yeah we will have  
um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy  
yeah  
um well the picture is not very clear but as you can see there are <unk> oi oh oh oh sorry for that  
your pen  
yeah but it might be more <unk> uh let's see it you could if you're lucky  
okay  
mm-hmm  
do you know  
because of that  
uh maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style  
now what else is different  
yeah but it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very  
yeah  
so what have we lemon banana is  
does that mean that one button has a special form or  
just a base station next to the t. v. is the best possibility  
yeah  
that's fine  
so that's what we did  
i find anything more on that  
yeah you could  
but yeah  
okay  
so it puts i think even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of you've got all colour it's either that or nothing  
or not  
uh yeah and uh from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes  
perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product  
yes we are taking out line on its own  
as little as it is but yeah  
'cause you know like a wee bus journey over to <unk> might solve the problem if it's getting in the way  
and a linear prediction which is use which is approximating just the spectrum of for for and everything that that's that's all  
every device  
how can you use an l. c. d. screen  
this i prefer that we should make ourselves  
it would be a la longer name but  
thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle so you can reach it with your thumb  
i hope we can do this  
so we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first i will show the agenda so  
yeah  
mm  
yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button  
mm-hmm  
oh  
have a good day  
we uh are to get acquainted  
yeah  
oh wrong one  
yeah  
yeah we yeah you can get back to it  
yeah it's text  
and have it abstract  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
because it was important for young customers if you remember  
the spinning wheel with uh l. c. display like on the uh ipod which i am sure most of you know about  
okay  
no no  
yeah  
you send it  
'cause i mean would six hours a day be pushing it  
so there's fewer people trying to pull the discourse goals in different directions  
for channels will be good  
maybe you know i although i do also find flip open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever  
yeah  
um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so  
and then we could just in <unk> in <unk> or in something just create some massive super array of  
ah well  
so uh  
that's a  
you see uh if you have a voice commands and you are <unk> you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something  
i mean  
um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say  
mm continuum <unk>  
um uh or to some specific you know recommendation and things like that  
okay  
um is it not segments  
yeah  
no  
i think we were pushed  
i have to still have uh to order everything by the time and  
but then i'm i i <unk> i probably use that rule so half the time and just forgotten to use at other times  
excuse me  
well  
cause for example yeah  
yeah i think so  
oops it does  
but we'll return to that  
separated  
<unk>  
just save it  
no  
yeah  
yep  
so we could we we could be we could've been creative  
so the user interface is uh  
then i got a pop ups to go to the meeting  
line strengths  
um and it does this uh by well  
mm-hmm  
um i would imagine all of them  
and this one is said to be blue for example i dunno if it's the label  
i <unk>  
of what  
yeah  
how late is did we start his presentation uh  
interface yeah  
so  
i don't well actually i don't know about that at all  
zero  
so you have the <unk> the names of the things in there  
or first <unk>  
slight depression of the continuum near the lyman limit  
yeah so we are going to talk about the papers from <unk>  
okay  
b. s. bloated star  
function five  
these i think are the three main differences  
and the numbers  
okay  
so see you later  
so uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on <unk> because you all know  
like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like now i know what he's thinking 'cause i saw his book  
you can see what i've uh yeah  
what is spongy  
um current remote controls do not match well with the operating <unk> of the user  
and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television  
sorry  
it was necessary for me to uh  
if <unk>  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
okay  
yeah  
oh uh look uh look at the pictures  
ah that's it yep  
uh  
uh before i start with the with the meeting i have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in  
so um come back to the presentation now  
two dollars for the uh for the add on modules and finally three dollars for the charger  
oh yeah  
just kind of a light non <unk> grey so that <unk> wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers  
um the project process satisfaction with for example the room for creativity  
yeah  
have to  
uh the <unk> yeah the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote  
but if <unk> because now you are just telling us you have no time indeed to work on this right  
mm  
i think it's just um it did do it  
yeah  
participant one no  
and that's all the same  
mm-hmm  
like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic <unk> design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know  
well okay  
a li little bit maybe  
yeah  
yeah  
is my three twenty one is the next meeting  
and obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel  
yeah definitely  
um  
should we actually bite the bullet here  
and  
titanium no  
so we are here to just make the point  
mm-hmm  
i thought it was good but uh yeah  
i. d.  
yeah  
so <unk> for any of you it's a first conference or maybe for  
<unk> towards this practical function  
yeah  
for cheap remote control yeah  
yeah or beeps or yeah  
okay so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it  
as a confirmation or whatever you know  
mm-hmm  
so i think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button  
yeah  
yeah what do you all think  
right  
uh-huh  
you said previously that you there's um microphone inside an  
yeah  
thank you  
i will uh instruct you about that soon  
okay  
because sometimes <unk> when you watch the t. v. in fact you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands  
yeah  
so uh  
well that didn't some up on mine  
north  
although i guess if there's a sort of if you think about standard interfaces that people use already  
one scroll wheel  
yeah  
people discuss them as a separate class  
uh i ordered according to the um starting times of the utterances  
uh so i thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one  
that just that is just for a t. v. but it's just a really good nice one  
okay  
so it would be better if <unk> if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would <unk> you what you would normally do  
<unk>  
huh  
so  
it would just couldn't we have a like uh  
um be careful about um finding mis transcriptions  
something that you can point to right  
well si since we're going for the uh the <unk> the sort of company colours  
anyway it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time  
to uh get sent to the chip  
through discussion  
nice uh you are here  
if we want to have that option you press that button in the remote  
and finally we've got our cradle <unk> our power cradle idea  
break it i don't get  
yeah you can set the window start utterance and window end utterance  
sure  
first it will be the functional design  
if it comes from above  
<unk> good  
okay  
um  
yeah  
so um our team is now fruits  
um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan  
yeah sure sure  
and it flips open on the side so it opens like that  
um right  
so we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana just maybe  
hmm  
okay  
it's okay  
i  
yeah mm  
that's true  
mm  
yeah  
i think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one  
that's all be because of you  
it was really good yeah  
our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users  
i don't know about the lunch break  
yes yes guess  
oh  
that's a much more trendy than a potato one  
but um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that  
yeah maybe we <unk> like <unk> like we're leaving out the buttons for the the <unk> less frequently used stuff  
well we design it later  
yeah  
okay  
alright  
so these are traps  
which i can work a lot lot lot on this  
yeah  
i mean it's something that we can afford off budget 'cause  
oh two mountain views  
uh  
like how  
yeah yeah  
so you've it's it's not a completely experimental concept  
but one of the things that you one could imagine doing is um sen is you know  
and um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright  
oh so so we'll just put them i there we we yeah <unk> we won't even okay  
mm mm  
yeah  
so  
thank you  
i've never done any coding in my life  
smile fish  
okay  
i think it would work best with utterances or segments  
oh you mean for the yeah <unk> <unk> or things like that  
from our well designed tool  
definitely  
'cause you can send from any email address you like  
changes like that that were just announced we'll we'll be able to catch for these first passes  
because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false  
right  
mm  
yeah  
hmm  
uh so no we just we keep the l. c. d.  
um <unk> well we can  
yeah um yeah  
is that is that gonna mark up a lot  
we don't rule them out uh yet  
but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something  
uh  
and then they had a camera on showing what my slides were and so you forget that they can see you at all  
um well so uh uh like i said i thought we'd we'd use more function  
well yeah like the compass point one  
so it's a something that will you know appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds  
yeah  
okay because i guess the voice recognition feature <unk> consumes quite a <unk> uh a lot of power  
so it maybe not the it's it's too late uh to to do it  
well i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of <unk> a lot of the different concepts  
okay  
so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home  
which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh  
uh of course we dropped a little bit of those uh  
yeah  
so but in that case  
no no definitely not  
um and <unk> this is all linked in with the the the user interface whether we <unk> um  
everyone else  
can you  
yeah  
but we don't want it to be yeah  
mm-hmm  
<unk> four <unk> no  
yeah  
thank you thank you  
i can't just leave it there  
oh  
and again i'll take minutes  
um a lot of the buttons aren't used and uh  
they don't see their own gaze to the other person  
it i think it needed more than half an hour considerably more than what have half an hour <unk> to delay it for our meetings  
alright  
yeah  
yeah  
to find it  
so yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh instead of the current functional look and feel  
yes  
or i am occupying in this direction when i speak  
okay  
yeah  
because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our  
exactly so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it then that's cheaper  
'cause when  
uh i know this guy yeah yeah  
yeah <unk> yeah if they think it's handy to use a pen  
um well i don't i don't know if we have to discuss this already or in the next uh meeting  
yeah and the at symbol  
mm  
but  
here  
uh it's do it's done before  
and everything is it's a great opportunity for her at least  
yeah  
mm 'kay  
we're definitely <unk> on the younger people 'cause that was our main goal  
uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five  
mm  
so which number  
okay um the fourth one  
i think we were  
hmm  
okay i will go go for two  
but we believe j. p. to be defining that maybe  
mm  
yeah yeah  
i it just an idea  
the method that we're going to use to complete the project that has three components as such  
i i had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh  
and then you from these unsupervised starts you can know which document of p. l. is close from the document of p. u. or the reverse  
for the m.  
yeah  
it relies on this really close frame rate that's underneath  
we decided 'cause it's not on our list  
um well uh i said i'm the project manager and uh i'm hoping uh for a good project and uh i'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project  
no  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and i can even do the display to a vast degree without actually having their supplying framework working  
yeah  
no never  
but you see that sometimes even here it's a bit like uh it's for instance if people would like to have like some motion compensation  
mm-hmm  
there you go  
yeah i think it is is faster  
i don't know which shape you should should take but  
now he's not gonna give you a set of tags 'cause that's not the kind of guy he is  
from ipod yeah  
yeah  
so  
i don't know how you think about it  
same as a hyper luminous galaxy being very very extreme  
the user uses to control its operation and input data  
but are we going for a strange uh form  
i'm not <unk> i don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly or  
thank you  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah it's looking quite good though  
and then the round ones you sort of feel by you know that's the second one down that sort of thing  
um so that's probably seeing that we're probably not gonna go into any whatever base blah blah blah <unk> model blah blah blah about <unk> combining them  
ah i do  
yeah  
it's quite easy to do though  
i think if we just sort of tone it down a bit  
yeah  
or maybe we should <unk> we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom  
oh <unk> i understand  
can be easily done 'cause  
and um so what i have found and after a lot of work actually i i draw this i draw for you this uh <unk> that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know  
in play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have <unk> go or  
no uh i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device but the shape of the inside of the device  
and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t. v.  
but the entire corpus  
we have a perfect remote  
yeah  
okay so the buttons would be like you know individual users or yeah  
but it's construct one  
yes  
the first time is done online  
um because it was all these things that are done for joint problem solving and joint action i think are very relevant to look at because these people are solving a problem together  
alright  
well you're discussing it on thursday right  
she's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants  
like it's it's two kilo bits per second  
well five also uh norman please  
ah  
we we <unk> yeah we could get another version of it that actually works  
one  
so there's no particular reason i pen  
if it's part of the proper name of an instrument  
uh well if you've got the number of <unk> in the average time you can then just generate it  
just  
one  
i i don't know  
yeah  
he did it before  
okay  
hmm  
yeah  
with some with plus or minus something or other yeah around it  
like covering <unk>  
yeah  
people said uh we should have at least two or three spare places just for you know growing or sometimes you have three interns that arrive  
yeah  
and uh uh i would say uh <unk> can you begin  
yeah  
not too much then <unk> alright  
yeah okay but it has to be like a split second because you have to put in a code also and  
maybe you want  
the battery  
yeah  
rechargeable  
okay so at least anyone who's feeling yeah exactly  
so uh i'll just try to um <unk> <unk>  
yeah  
maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing  
and the second thing now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy  
yeah  
actually this marketing report is restricted to t. v. remote controls  
so power button on top  
okay  
it's maybe a little bit expensive  
what do they want with the screen  
yeah but maybe we can paint it  
uh i see what you mean  
so and last question will i change my rem change my remote control from <unk> banana  
um and then  
yeah  
and that's the type of slider that we can actually leave in and like show 'cause that's that's functionality  
i really don't  
functional conceptual and <unk> detailed design  
i think they are looking for that  
yeah  
but do they  
yeah  
do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account  
we now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control  
but then the like up button and down button for the channel channel changing  
yeah uh  
where about just in appleton tower  
and um the next presenter will be tara  
yeah of course yeah  
and i then i have some more findings  
so you can make it <unk> a little broader  
sorry i'm just i'm trying to arrange them so that we have one above the other so to make some sense of that  
well we had a dog a few years ago  
i think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator  
yeah  
well you know me contingency planning and all this  
okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control  
yes  
<unk>  
it uh i think that'd be useful for me as well  
but then you'll get two large values  
maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much or we just like flat buttons something  
yeah  
yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years  
well um i would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway  
hmm  
mm  
mm-hmm  
it smiles nicely  
if they can yeah if they can give me my c. files then also it's okay  
i think that we should incorporate that  
i mean where i mean if second select from shot one to seven  
get an email  
but if it said red or blue excess rather than red or blue component i guess the problem with  
and sometimes with the i would be thinking are you anticipating a or you're you <unk> trying to say the and you're just saying the the the the the  
oh  
a cable between the remote control and the t. v. won't be a good idea  
but just one big teletext button on and off  
they actually reference to the same thing  
some information about that about um what people whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control  
mm  
i don't mind  
yeah  
no no no no  
they can send it to p. g. c. at ling as long as we can get the <unk> i'll tell you what i'll do then  
yeah uh we could do that  
mm is that not getting too much  
i know i'm hated  
mine too  
and perhaps we could uh implement that  
well as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm  
they know that okay these things work on every task so okay we can <unk> put hands on these things yeah  
we've got special material rubber wood titanium et cetera and that so i was originally  
two  
yes okay  
good good  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly so let's go to it  
so uh technically it will be possible  
well we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user friendly  
we're on our way  
but uh or when i added it  
okay  
if you uh ask yourself it offers enough features i don't i don't think  
ah yes yes that seems good  
yeah  
or well but like uh like more than just the battery like a complete different like you've only got like  
okay  
yep  
because um there is a question about do you want an l. c. d. screen and and that wasn't responded to but uh some of the larger  
but  
well how much extra would the additional chip be  
i actually haven't really thought about like uh marking or not marking who's top and who's bottom  
and this one was sixteen euros  
and the feedback can come through television itself so do we need an l. c. d. on the remote  
okay eleven  
so if you have sound  
it's the five by five i can't read that much  
it's nice as an added feature feature that um  
oh a <unk> a dynamo  
because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed  
not only this buttons all the buttons  
is that correct  
it's not that innovative  
yeah  
but um but that the same theory or the the same analysis can be applied to both parts  
yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah no no i mean that's these uh  
so so like i said we had no insight in finances no prices but we have 'em now  
mm-hmm  
that was really good those beaches are really good  
fifteen or something  
so  
what does it mean  
okay  
so in the long term this can actually save you money  
i could not understand clearly clearly that  
you know <unk> you know at the right times <unk> you know especially you two  
we believe  
yeah that's the one  
yeah but when all the questions i had do we want to use uh a menu display on the t. v.  
yeah  
yeah  
but with uh buttons like that which are easy to use we uh might attract them too  
mm-hmm  
oh  
but we have to uh think of some other uh important things  
yeah <unk> or mm-hmm  
but then we have to include four metre as well  
the <unk> the main base will be plastic but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in  
but  
mm  
oh yeah that did happen once before  
<unk> no you have to exit  
so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic  
oh oh okay great  
um from energy source um uh what we would use  
some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions  
but i've  
so  
really  
okay  
okay that's uh  
okay  
yes  
or below because that's pretty relevant  
yeah particularly if we've uh there was a bit in <unk> about r. s. i. and things as well  
so our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set so which has to be original trendy and user friendly  
yeah  
yep  
so here's let's see  
so this is the simplex  
<unk> yeah  
maybe just a slap on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal  
'cause you could go through and see that um actually the pattern of of addressing different discourse goals is too dispersed to um to be able to do that kind of mark up  
yeah  
yeah that  
yeah  
yeah  
this is quite fun actually  
yeah here it is  
yes  
mm  
and um well how do uh do we want to look at uh uh <unk> um yeah does a remote look well  
as opposed to out of it  
yeah  
for example  
ca can i have can the functions be implement in an  
mm-hmm yeah mm  
fro from outside we can view them  
so  
fancy  
will will you two just uh keep on working on improving the information density measures or do you think there'll be a point when you say well that's that's it  
or it's  
apparently the headset mic files are are just a bit louder  
yep  
um and it should be in there  
perfect  
no no he he maybe he might be using same p. l. p. features or something it they are different  
so  
yeah  
it is very prominent  
and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward  
maybe water proof would be very original  
it's uh so some people can but  
basic function  
that's very artificial though isn't it  
yeah  
it should be a good in your hand  
that you have a a screen that will come up here and can go down that way  
um po  
well channel programme or contents or in an easy way so  
okay  
<unk>  
why a turtle  
it looks like candle wax  
and there is a one frame every sixteen millisecond and they overlap of fifty percent  
and here i have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more  
you have to deal with what you're given  
<unk> shape and then just went from there really  
no  
well  
we need to close the meeting  
oh yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
no  
that's right so we're dis so you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back  
we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a <unk> a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control  
then we have an infrared sender i think that's basic we cannot do without  
yeah  
but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup holder  
well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool  
you wouldn't for example when we were saying silicone two levels we didn't mark silicone two  
okay  
no it's a two  
spongy is gonna be difficult i'm afraid  
it would change but not for me  
well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah  
i believe so yeah  
perfect  
um i'm actually gonna be bold and go <unk> go straight for rubber um for reasons i'll go into uh in more detail  
no  
i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles  
no  
um i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder but i'll send you an email when i do it so that you know  
thank you  
and  
oh  
so i was remembering what i was learned or what i was taught at the time  
so we wanna decide um what <unk> <unk> should do next and maybe think about meeting in i don't know a month or something  
special colour  
uh  
that's you excellent  
galaxy distribution  
that's what's circulating  
l. d. a. or like  
oh right cool  
uh well i so the last thing i've got from him about work work was the nineteenth of october that said he <unk> some changes that you wanted  
and then time was up  
now  
mm-hmm  
for a specific word per  
mm-hmm  
no not all because you need most of them the arrow buttons  
um and uh the project  
well otherwise we probably have to go over it and like add some integer that we just increment from top to bottom sort of to every utterance as an as an i. d. some type  
right  
yeah  
if i i it depends if you live in in switzerland or you live in  
it was such a great idea  
well  
you know the number of things you buy these days which you know have a a a lithium whatever battery in  
can we uh  
i mean  
they would maybe careful  
three or two  
the fax is in the administration office since it's mostly used by <unk> who's the secretary  
would there be other cases where you would actually mark an ab absorption  
it says mountains  
yeah  
mm  
can we have can we think about maybe having a a non <unk> non non rectangular one so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something  
yeah i would say buttons because it's yeah  
i'll think of that  
okay  
hmm  
is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh  
and basically they try to match what is displayed  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
those two  
so uh if you uh lock on a remote uh let's say channel fifteen  
complete our questionnaire and some sort of <unk> which <unk> you'll get immediately by email  
i think the the most of the bad words are at the beginning when the people try to put in on  
it should not that i it should not happen that you're doing so many things and ultimately it doesn't goes into a thesis  
yeah you blow on it and i  
no <unk> you do the minutes first or  
half an hour  
so this is out of discussion  
we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale  
actually i i did email <unk> to ask if they'd had a set of instructions they'd given their participants  
um i think that a single function remote control would be preferable because it's easier to use  
so it's just like a mouse  
i'm not sure if you received them as well um but i will tell you about it  
mm kay  
line in  
so we don't know if it's  
and then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees  
taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody  
the  
okay  
but we if you forget about the kinetic well if we do that  
and uh personal preferences  
so maybe we get together again in the yeah i mean i'll send them the references immediately  
but  
yeah  
yeah it does tend to help  
i promised these guys i'd be there  
so after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it  
yes i'm gonna build a dictionary then from that  
yep  
yeah also no one's gonna buy it  
that sounds good  
to specify in this first phase of of the project  
i think so  
well that's <unk> that was one of the approaches sure  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side <unk> um to make it easier to hold on to  
i have another thing uh  
yeah we could skip the numbers  
they like that spongy feel  
and uh then we'll have the closing  
yeah  
yeah with the energy  
yeah  
and the custom designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon  
bad estimation  
um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television not the v. c. r. d. v. d. or anything else  
so i think in the actual browser itself i don't wanna sit on the s. q. l. if we can sit on the x. m. l. because sitting on the x. m. l. we have all we have so much help  
okay alright  
yeah  
okay  
you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television  
okay but no more buttons or functions or  
yes  
teamwork  
i don't think that's a separate class of quasar  
yeah  
no there's no menu  
yeah  
if we are going to add a speech interface  
yeah well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them  
which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not  
uh yeah  
yeah  
okay  
<unk>  
we hate this  
so three three there's three buttons on a slider  
like l. c. d. screens and voice recognition  
but you'll get uh what you want is to figure out what are the um the concepts behind that data that you want represented  
mm-hmm  
silver rubber  
okay  
very productive  
uh  
speech recognition you reckon then is <unk> simple  
you know like um i i think you guys probably got the same emails i did but the idea of um  
yeah have some have some  
so yeah  
just working out what we're gonna do for the next time  
no  
and then there's um  
yeah we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here so we just yeah so even if you don't put it works  
yeah  
okay so it's it's <unk> a very basic remote then it's only  
no porn channel for children  
that people feel like they're <unk> it when they buy it even you know just just by the fact of choosing  
yeah  
it's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is  
it was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that  
oh possibly yeah yeah maybe  
you still have to have some some button in the menu to go back  
right  
but there are also reports from <unk> i think  
yeah absolutely  
some relevance clause  
so there's no cost associated with it being mornings or afternoons  
was that does that mean to it single curve  
yeah but it should be li like this big and i don't think  
it's a dog  
okay thanks  
it's like <unk>  
so just don't witter away you know weeks on <unk> when we've got the real me meat of this yet to come  
that's no problem  
source type  
really  
yeah  
and then you have one for your d. v. d. and you sort of slide it out and then you have another one you slide it out  
no  
well <unk> what i found um can you  
okay  
fashionable chic people will  
you know what i mean  
yeah  
yeah unless you are a all the time sitting  
now i'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh  
um  
mm-hmm  
great  
i i read some of the other techniques  
mm  
yeah  
that  
so the design of our remote control is very important  
yeah i i dunno i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do  
i i would say that it's  
hardly what i'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now  
yeah  
normal functional um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface  
oh like that  
um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here  
then you know banana remote control could be fun for them as well  
couldn't we couldn't we write one programme that calculates all the um <unk> for all our different contributions to the importance measure the um a absolute um dialogue act numbers for the meeting  
twenty million  
and maybe it could be also <unk> on the the amount of of light in the room  
the channels buttons one to nine and uh off uh uh zero to nine and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine  
could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report  
alright  
that's okay  
it's just a gimmick  
roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe  
come on  
if you have a basic design a little <unk> a little smaller on the on the <unk> on the edges  
that's okay  
so we'll have to look into that  
oh it wasn't in the way but yeah whatever  
alright um and does the design match the appropriate <unk>  
take this out and here see  
just remind something  
it's not working like a pen yet  
yeah  
hmm  
yep  
so we can now that's now just lovely  
i mean just it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time  
mm-hmm but you follow what i'm <unk> i'm <unk>  
but it's all there if you need it  
okay  
get this  
uh i'll go uh for the two  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i don't think line brightness temperatures counts  
mm  
but then you'd have to pull the two pull the two sounds together  
oh that's the select button  
it's an in built menu isn't it  
but i can easily add it to give that information if you want  
you just push two button zero and and one  
what interface  
yeah i think it all is yeah i think it is all <unk> one name  
like  
well we won't be able to tell  
so we can just create an additional x. m. l. file which for every utterance like the utterances have i. d. <unk> i presume some references  
i think it's also harder to  
mm  
mm-hmm  
um  
there are two ways of doing it  
one i <unk> no <unk>  
okay  
sound related question  
okay  
yeah  
ah it's just to test the system i think  
channel settings  
but  
yep  
i'd say two  
it was things that weren't distinct like yeah  
that that shouldn't be a real issue i think  
make it make it a two  
i think an l. c. d. screen should be <unk> sufficient  
but  
yeah go ahead  
so now more design  
so you know probably what i was thinking is um certainly second and third years absolutely need to be uh top on top priority  
it's probably good for us to look at what the audio player is capable of doing  
mm-hmm  
you've to make it <unk> uh  
i think they're starting blocks yeah  
so then again i will pass through full network  
um um in the conceptual design um i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product  
and i was supposed to have it in uh in january  
no that's it  
this is a meeting on functional design  
mm that's the hard <unk> oh i might uh given the trouble we've had with this corpus i can't make any promises  
okay  
yeah i mean the we <unk>  
be original yeah  
um then we'll move to the three presentations  
okay  
then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other <unk> other ones  
but uh do we want that  
uh well he said about <unk> <unk> what he said about pointing  
um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better  
so it's one for from your point of view  
okay  
uh uh  
i also think we should not add too many buttons  
oh no my remote has acne  
yeah and do you want  
do we really need <unk> to provide more information on what r. s. i. is  
oh  
if you're into it can you make a text file which just like makes just the words  
hmm  
bob  
hmm  
and uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do <unk> individual works  
remotes do have screens where you can navigate you know  
mm yeah it's a  
and you have a pen  
so it's a  
in thirty minutes but uh i think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
i i this is just a base  
um i have one set and uh a remote control when i dropped it uh it broke  
okay  
yeah that's the question i was just gonna ask does he sleep  
we have two special colours  
go ahead  
yeah  
it's a very small yeah i'm drawing it big now but so you can put your remote on flat for example  
mirror mirror the effect with this  
easy to find  
exotic yeah  
um  
right  
yeah  
but no it's it's not it's not a nice way i'm just saying  
uh i had an email from the from the management board uh i don't know if you a al also uh received it  
yeah i'm right  
i think  
yeah i dunno  
i say backup but it's a cache  
well done us  
thanks  
so then try front runner scheme on well a front runner theory  
any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing we should go for it  
yeah so wouldn't it i mean the problem is they've me haven't looked at the exact inner workings of their of their engineered  
let's see if this yeah if you meet  
um we can go and see olivier unless you want to talk about something else  
that's what's displayed on that the bar is real time isn't it  
yeah because th th the evaluation project  
just one would be necessary  
well we just listened  
okay  
two or three  
are we still with that idea that we want to display bars for the individual speakers  
by the way  
okay  
they say that  
one assumes this  
yeah  
up and down far apart from each other  
okay  
um it makes it also more uh <unk> i think to our uh audience  
yeah  
uh yeah this is my report on trend watching  
um sebastian told us a few things about the technical <unk> uh implications  
or we can move to the next part maybe and discuss afterwards  
it's a television remote control  
<unk>  
so can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made  
wow  
mm  
<unk>  
right  
yeah  
which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house you know  
no  
no they're not  
take your time  
i think that will <unk> uh uh even when it's a bit more cost it will still sell  
<unk> yeah otherwise it uh it'll go on destroying other disks  
next slide  
standard i just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me  
the available uh components for energy are we have a basic battery a hand an uh dynamo like in uh old torches  
no  
mm  
yeah  
i haven't got my glasses on so i hope it's this one  
and i didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here so i went right  
that they don't  
mm  
right yeah  
we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so  
yeah three three or four uh four uh colours or something like that  
<unk> not the noise level the sound level  
yep  
mm  
so you use x. fig to make the parts and then you this thing  
yeah  
yeah but why do the main value which are comparing to  
mm-hmm  
i've no problem with that  
<unk> such a <unk> such a device  
oh okay  
yeah that's right  
mm yeah that weird i dunno what that is but yeah  
they <unk> they should get kids and just stick 'em in t. v. and say change the channel  
so this was uh  
but i <unk> yeah i mean i obviously you wanna have a front runner scheme i in mind before you  
yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be that  
yeah  
the network is an instrument though isn't it  
no  
no the colour is in the l. c. d.  
of course then it doesn't sound as the original because it's more whispered or whatever  
i agree yeah and not too <unk> too many keys of course yeah  
okay  
could they be smelly  
any other chang uh thoughts  
okay  
i think that actually that might be a problem of the whole um annotation that if they aren't exactly consistent in how they <unk> uh transcribe stuff like that  
it is just a construction task rather than a puzzle  
how about friday then  
mm-hmm  
it is the <unk> of  
looks like we've designed a  
so have your finger under here like this i suppose  
uh we can use for that uh <unk> with copper wires it's it is uh  
um the basis for her email but just make sure that they know it's relevant to them et cetera  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah but i it it should appear as a continuous thing <unk> for the yeah  
i would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about yeah but that are important  
alright  
it's for it's just for small vocabulary  
so  
yeah  
yeah if you want to adjust like for example adjust the audio settings  
i just  
that's for the so uh next point  
we'll just go uh  
so they ask <unk> they ask people to sit and listen basically  
yeah  
that's by far the biggest one and then teletext is still here that's like fourteen and volume selection  
eight  
yeah  
so the case material will just have one colour right but then the buttons will be in special colours  
no it's not these days  
steep soft component is something you can point at in a spectrum and say there it is  
like yeah  
yep  
the materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from and uh well the <unk> of the buttons should be indestructible  
yeah  
or we can do something we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey let the public choose what they want  
sometimes they're two segments and one with a gap in between but um the have um th th they don't overlap  
a product prototype  
to use  
no they've made that one up certainly  
but i'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition  
i imagine that's a good question  
they just made that up  
positioning of buttons the actual shape of the hand held device colours  
oh yeah i take care it's all right  
okay <unk> should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh  
the first years who've only just arrived would do a poster  
so it gives the possibility to decide to go uh in a different direction that can be more on this uh let's say  
but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and  
alright we go with the l. c. d. screen  
yeah  
it doesn't have to be really big but just just have to be has to be there  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but you can can zap down  
put the <unk> cursor on the  
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's working it's working  
five minutes for finishing  
yeah we should too bad we don't have the finance  
but anyway  
no isn't possible  
and we're done  
but  
sorry uh  
yeah i will show that now  
yeah th that kind of stuff but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um  
okay  
that's the problem  
yeah  
no  
so the at at at the moment it's ins well  
maybe closer to three even or two and a half  
so i think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote  
alright  
mm-hmm  
yeah it has to be uh  
okay  
so they find them ugly  
well this is um the  
but trendy yeah  
<unk> <unk> just the remote control  
mm  
but also devices connected to the to the t. v. i mean be able to operate  
yes  
because we wanna have multiple versions of these things but yeah copy it into your directory and keep the same name  
yeah  
what i what i know but for speech coding no no no it was i don't know  
um and  
yes  
uh not not towards you but towards this all  
<unk> <unk> can you make you make we can use uh the drawing board now i think  
mm-hmm  
actually yeah 'cause the t. f. i. d. f. wouldn't make any sense with  
mm-hmm  
um  
yeah  
very multifunctional  
we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in press the menu button scroll up and down to select it  
nee no you just go ahead and present the <unk> we'll scrap it later because  
technology innovation was good because of a marketing uh requirement  
uh right  
but if was it a management decision that we're having okay  
so  
do you have uh <unk> that was okay  
but do uh <unk> do we uh do the speech just for the basic options for the simple buttons  
but <unk> yeah exactly  
so on the outside it looks easy but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside  
maximum is maximum  
<unk> or commas  
yeah  
in a productive way so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product  
no  
no  
oh yeah  
yeah  
like match how people behave  
yeah  
is it plugged in prop it's working  
right  
the number of uh yeah  
and we found it was some stupid well  
yeah  
yeah if you if you go to eight i don't know how to  
it is uh okay  
is that a lizard  
okay  
okay  
wow  
we have three  
mm  
well ma make it not <unk> <unk> spongy is the current thing  
funky customers  
i yeah  
pretty clear  
yep  
yeah  
camera  
so as long as you can hold off his no no  
so as we discussed before we need to we would like to have some speech recognition <unk> chip in our remote control  
alright i'm heather and i've  
it was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen  
mm-hmm  
okay just talk ahead  
okay  
do i have oh yeah  
is it a plane  
yeah  
yeah  
this uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer  
but  
you al you also take uh <unk> you take your <unk> and go uh play games  
you can have a kinetic provision of energy which is used on some watches these days  
hence we might not be able to put it in there  
um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a well conventional remote i think  
uh well that wa that was <unk> well a few weeks ago  
and so it's maybe it's not r. s. t. um but it's um more akin to um i don't know is it <unk>  
that what else can we need  
<unk> i should check  
oh it's export  
like a ticker tape  
no  
uh it's not double anymore eh  
okay  
hmm  
nee  
yeah  
yeah  
you just press it  
uh no i th i'm i'm coming round to it actually  
well uh these these shouldn't  
things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for  
good morning everybody  
it's uh it's bent  
like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons how can it be something in between  
i'll i'll  
unless you want to do it  
mm  
sure  
yes  
yeah  
oh you don't  
thank you  
yes assuming you're talking about star burst galaxies rather than star burst within a galaxy  
okay  
worth does it have added worth  
okay  
okay  
then we say it's fine so it's all good  
functional requirements  
right okay  
okay we went for the double curved case  
is it  
whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer  
probably have to plot them 'cause some of them are also i mean this is just added by different speakers for example  
yeah  
yeah  
i won't be yeah  
i me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value you know um so um and channel  
but <unk> um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs  
well there's sometimes combinations i mean like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power  
uh i am the technical designer i dunno which one uh <unk>  
simple simple rather  
we don't want people to focus on uh what's going on uh what on the feedback  
uh yeah  
<unk> nah  
i dunno  
yep you're right  
true  
it'd be harder to <unk> <unk> uh buttons i think  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah  
yeah some higher level yeah  
yep  
well less than twenty nine even  
right  
hmm  
nope  
um so this person didn't ha um th obviously didn't know about <unk>  
i think it's quite nice  
i think this is about it  
yeah  
uh i will introduce myself uh and uh i think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself  
mm-hmm  
i think well i think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about i mean the the company colours are important apparently  
where are they  
two  
a big apple  
this is good  
exactly  
yeah we  
that was really neat how i got emails and  
um  
rub rubber comes coloured it's i would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured it's different  
but you know you don't have to do that  
but  
so basically older people don't really care  
and this must be uh volume i think and this programme  
no  
can you uh push the button  
yeah yeah for switchboard yeah  
you see  
yes  
that that's what i mean  
you have uh <unk>  
huh  
browse through the meeting  
and um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it  
mm-hmm  
uh i mean uh um yeah  
yeah  
end of march  
we've got five more minutes  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's a little difficult what i'm gonna tell you  
okay  
i mean diff if you can <unk> this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy  
one with two scroll buttons and one with without  
and you'll be different  
okay  
um i maybe for chi it's it six but uh yeah but uh for <unk> it's for the tests i did it two point four  
uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes  
yeah  
strong soft x. ray flux  
tool training  
um so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with um the the the the digital pen  
as far as fashion update we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths shoes and furniture  
would you care to examine the prototypes see how they feel in the hand  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
which is <unk> again different but with uh high quality uh they would be happy with the both  
easily go ahead  
we're gonna talk about project finances  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
well <unk> do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing  
mm  
okay just keep on going just to have an idea  
yeah  
no it shouldn't  
oh sorry  
mm-hmm  
yeah treble <unk> middle bass or something  
yeah that's the thing you point to and this is a <unk> a physical mechanism  
the next one  
yeah  
<unk> may be interesting actually  
hmm  
i'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing  
mm-hmm  
so if you um keep on working on rainbow meanwhile and try to find a way how to tie your rainbow stuff into  
mm  
mm-hmm  
because  
so basically what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set  
yeah me too  
i dunno where the lemon is but i mean it's not obvious  
is it easy to <unk> change channels  
well maybe you could  
it's uh it's just something you gotta remember once the part's been built  
to go for the the manufacturers  
yeah  
yellow and grey but then the <unk> in blue  
it's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail  
and then  
i don't know  
uh in the project i'm supposed to be the <unk>  
uh  
that's right  
uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible  
that's a physical process  
yeah  
yeah  
uh one <unk> nine  
yeah  
that one  
so maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step but maybe i dunno for ours maybe we should  
<unk> advanced yeah  
it would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff  
but uh what is the main interest  
no  
but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double a. <unk>  
or maybe three actually  
unless you want to plug it back in to yours  
okay can you continue please mi  
yeah  
and then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick  
yes  
on the back  
fluctuations  
yeah  
okay i'm i'm fine with this but i can make it run on my machine  
ye that's the impression i get yeah  
<unk>  
the the requirements you just said maybe we should first have a discussion about that  
yeah  
i think the colour is more important than the really the curve because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control  
okay  
so  
well we still have uh more than five minutes  
it's just that all kinds of crazy things happen when you're running things  
so we will do that  
okay  
yeah that's right  
you you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour really  
mm  
yeah i think yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually i mean  
you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like  
so um uh did we uh do that  
but i mean i would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for <unk> channels up and channels down  
you take a look at that  
yeah i mean i haven't really decided on uh how to really get the information out of this now  
i think it should be a <unk>  
and when i first saw that i thought hmm well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it  
yeah  
right  
the <unk> the turbo button  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel  
i uh  
it's possible but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a <unk> a different colour  
next  
yeah  
and i'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then i'm gonna instead of ugly i'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true  
we don't have to do all that  
so that's fantastic  
i uh forgot to put my name over here it's uh it's martin  
but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party  
those like yeah sort of spongy ones  
the chances are so if if they're holding it anyway  
um  
so each person in turn i'd like us to go up to the <unk>  
<unk> so do we think these ideas an and my uh <unk> speech recognition  
thank you very much  
i say potato peeler but i'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than i do  
oh who is that  
um but we can evaluate the process and um uh  
yes  
if it's cheap  
yeah well i i th it's high  
yeah  
the lines here along the grip  
it's just discussion  
oh no this would i i would i would give this model to the old people actually  
yeah  
well <unk> for as far as i can see three of us agree and only nils  
yeah right right and maybe we should use colours  
yeah and if we're going for sleek and sexy i think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky  
maybe i mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front  
um  
so that was already discussed by poppy  
per project  
okay  
no  
for long discussion and  
okay  
messy  
uh but maybe  
uh well all the things we have uh discussed uh the energy which uh turn out to be uh batteries so that's  
at ami  
designing a project uh i also look at you uh <unk> keep in mind uh uh uh people uh  
okay  
and we have the slave p. c. which take cares about the white board and the slides  
same with conceptual design and detailed design  
yeah but do you actually need the remote talking back  
'cause it <unk> it can display from any utterance to any other utterance  
no no no no no  
sorry  
that's all  
yeah  
true  
right  
and for something for kids  
yeah  
or like or like something in between the three and and five agreements but not more  
<unk> okay we can think about that  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah maybe so  
yeah but it will be technologically <unk> innovative so  
yeah  
but didn't they just say it's just for t. v. or are we gonna  
oh so far  
no  
but i would like to say we can make uh uh a schedule of that project to just to track to just to see if we track the time table  
okay  
if  
and here i compare the performance of the gamma base system with the standard h. m. m. g. m. m. system  
and these things whoa  
so if you look at amanda <unk> thesis and the analysis that she did sort of within a turn she used something like r. s. t.  
uh and it <unk> uh  
that 'cause that's that's fine  
yeah  
right  
uh  
yeah just just just stuff that you wanna share just put it in the in the project folder like i put my presentation now  
but uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get  
so you you would you <unk> you can uh link like this  
yeah  
it's also to gets to know each other because um i'm asking three things uh for that uh drawing to do it on a blank sheet  
yeah  
okay  
so we can no we have to think about that  
i think it's uh it's important to uh <unk> all the the decisions that we make so we  
but blue blue's okay  
swahili  
wales for example  
hmm  
so this is this the the first question  
yeah  
and they start working on two uh different uh sub projects  
mm yeah  
this is just radio frequency  
mm  
they physically also separate the things  
even for each <unk> for even for different family we have to do <unk> yeah we would we have to do adaptation to  
uh yeah  
see what people want in a remote what buttons are used more often and <unk> stuff like that  
that's different  
oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our  
you could you could uh change the colours that was also the idea  
that's like it  
or <unk> two two after two more likely  
but i believe you will have an  
um  
who who's their is that a staff member or a student  
uh you can you can <unk> uh let choose the customer which colour he wants yeah  
mm-hmm  
see i was gonna say the scroll wheel <unk> thing 'cause  
well we've banned them from  
i had no way to evaluate this well  
so the the main components you see here are the cheapest i have found and  
maybe if you change if you take the buttons out and maybe do things like that  
but uh that's your your job to find something mm matches  
no <unk> <unk>  
well the titanium i don't want to lose actually  
yeah  
you wouldn't talk about  
well that's actually one of the point yeah  
it's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's  
great  
hang on  
by associating each channel with the name or  
uh it can be this  
'cause it's easy to dump out the <unk>  
yeah  
we didn't give it i don't thing over discussing  
i did get a bit more done than the last time 'cause i knew that i didn't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the  
mm-hmm  
but i like i mean when i say we have we had i believe we have room for creativity 'cause <unk> this is we did it  
yeah  
it's wow  
that's good  
like if there would be a machine like this with the two cards separated as i mention  
uh almost  
we have a gun instead of a remote control  
okay  
okay  
no no it's not  
okay then  
okay  
um it also needs to have the company colours included in it  
sorry  
and here the the switch that control if you want  
yeah  
so you'll ha all have your <unk> <unk> specific role and you know i suppose you know what you have to do  
yeah  
um  
now we th th then we settle on four  
mm-hmm  
so to give you an idea of uh  
so it's public what's booked and what isn't  
yeah  
and you know th the the design that i've got and and it could be a a home made design  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i guess yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that's <unk> i think we've got a kind of a good plan there  
yeah  
yeah  
make it possible to use uh a full <unk> matrix  
okay  
mm-hmm that's very true  
and the <unk> most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a t. v. set  
um a lot more tangible  
um parts are cheaper as well  
well is there not something <unk> something more easily  
suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour i  
um so hopefully our remote control reflects that <unk> in some way  
so it must be as easy as possible  
okay  
mm mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
hopefully i'll be back in time that we'll be able to do something the day before  
if you're holding it in your hand you could  
v. l. b. a.  
yeah  
good question sometime asking  
so uh  
<unk>  
hmm  
we used to have spaceship <unk> did you guys ever used to build spaceships with <unk> everybody knows best spaceships ever  
um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better  
it it  
no i don't think it's seven by seven i think it's seven the diagonal is seven  
what you're talking about doing is <unk> some of the programme logic in the data  
'kay  
no  
yeah that's what vera said  
one oh okay uh i have to <unk> explain something  
okay  
no continuum  
futuristic  
i don't think so  
um we're using a regular chip  
but i can fit 'em back in if  
alright  
cover  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah i'd maybe give it a  
it's a scroll  
oh right  
i will look to have a connection  
for example uh t. v. settings uh remote settings et cetera  
i think that's  
yeah it's it's funny  
yeah  
so  
huh  
but they are just less used <unk> yeah  
yeah  
but what i'm saying is right now we're middle market  
but still you had that as well  
you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your <unk> your provider gives a list of movies and then you select those list  
first step will be the functional design  
right  
g. dwarf  
hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you  
um  
no it won't  
um if we are targeting young adults it looks like something that would pay off  
i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on  
yeah  
yeah  
the analytic signal is the signal which is a complex which you can create from the uh real uh uh some sequence  
is it was that a volunteering yeah or great  
so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said  
uh we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things  
i really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an l. c. d. in it  
i don't think so if you see the options  
i mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take  
f. five  
you make it optional  
ah back today  
yeah  
maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control  
fabulous  
exactly yeah  
well um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases  
okay  
but if if if it like doubles uh  
hmm  
this is especially true when you have bullet list huh  
at the beginning we did  
um i dunno  
mm-hmm  
then what if their sprinklers don't work  
right yes  
alright see you in thirty minutes  
right  
yes sure  
maybe it can be yeah middle of like between those two li  
so  
okay so we only do this when we have enough money left  
yeah  
um  
oh it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking yeah  
we have a good price and uh  
well if it if it's if it's possible <unk> if it's not too expensive we should include it because it's it's cool  
oh are we all doing it individually  
yeah submarine  
yeah  
well maybe for the if you don't <unk> a button who <unk> who <unk> who do i call uh <unk> when i don't know it  
okay well uh just leave it at this and quickly save  
what do you want  
it's describing the line you're looking for  
what what market yes yes  
yeah <unk> problem solving decision making process to track that kind of information  
you didn't miss out that much  
okay sebastian did you have any other ideas  
mm  
technology  
yeah but <unk> your spinning wheel tends to go to one side  
uh he here it is still double curve the rubber the flashy the fruity the removable  
well what what's the difference between simple and regular  
no we said teletext also a separate menu  
yes please  
yeah remember the user is not happy to read the  
should be able to work  
uh no  
um i'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that  
what i'll just do is i'll just i'll probably not have a moving bar the whole length but just some indicator somewhere  
then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you  
so  
yeah but everything is  
like for speech recognition in a remote control  
i guess that's quite a that's a quite a bi big deal for setting up the recordings i guess  
no way anymore  
it's come on already  
and  
um the red ones are for uh changing channels channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected  
so okay the next step you can come back to your seat  
not in  
which we probably don't wanna do curved or very sexy double curved  
are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it  
i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level  
yeah or you could use plastic buttons  
everyone has a bookshelf in their office and we just go in and borrow books from everyone else  
yeah  
um the look and feel design is for kate uh steph gets the user interface design you get product evaluation  
yes  
yeah i can hear the chairs moving and the  
larger  
right  
no  
<unk> we we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow  
um i mean i guess right okay  
okay  
hmm  
i mean the ami ones were a lot better in term of that than m. four or whatever  
yeah  
you can easily find the button in the dark or so  
it might be  
that's my job  
so it's that's not as easy as it <unk> might look like  
alright  
mm-hmm  
so just half a euro for you have <unk> and an l. c. d. display  
mm  
it's interesting maybe we can create a a line of uh t. v. with uh a a <unk>  
i mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting  
wouldn't it  
yeah  
and uh this is for the artistic effect  
yeah i i think i think it was even slightly better yeah  
yeah i dunno  
okay  
uh  
yeah th that's another really good point  
let's  
<unk>  
okay  
okay  
yeah it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
not me  
okay  
yeah  
person  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh we want people to be able to use it <unk> as a remote control  
or just  
i well i think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh  
i think it's a real advantage that we've read different things and come at it from a different side because i think this ha they the the previous approaches haven't really  
exactly a cache  
wasn't ellen away  
not in <unk> the the my documents  
yeah  
no it's not  
standard  
the slogan on it  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah well they like uh something which is uh  
<unk> huh  
like over here  
yeah  
we have to repeat over and over  
yeah  
first a little about the project aim  
yeah i've do we uh save the  
<unk> <unk> where which software  
okay what about um the issue i um addressed at the beginning of the meeting  
not gonna try and pretend like i can get any better than that  
um  
<unk> is um research student <unk> will finish her master thesis so it's  
and  
mm-hmm  
what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t. v.  
yeah  
yeah  
and um we will also take a look at new project requirements um if you haven't heard about them yet  
um and the questions i did not talk about was uh going from location to uh identity of the person  
uh there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like  
which i think it probably should be even if it's a physical you know  
twelve fifty  
uh fifteen  
i mean  
mm  
yeah  
uh  
so we're we're not loading the whole thing at the moment yet properly  
okay so like a pet animal  
thanks  
all i need is no mic  
that is a piece of work  
okay  
i think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen  
if you have uh lots of uh marketing  
we think we got stifled for <unk> creativity by the company itself in restricting us only to using a t. v. remote initially  
yeah and it's got a different uh file for each speaker  
marketing the user requirement specification  
yeah but it says i i would buy this so  
i think you know you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control 'cause they're just not needed and they're not used  
but i mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't <unk> particularly see an alarm  
hmm  
do you think people that are people that buy a remote are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes  
uh yes  
'cause as soon as you do that um you exclude some of the information  
okay  
with the natural look  
like  
yeah  
yeah  
good morning sebastian  
goes off again  
no  
um  
hmm  
my preferences  
sorry  
fine to coarse  
mm-hmm  
our <unk>  
yeah yeah  
and two awesome  
so uh i guess the  
so i think numerals  
'cause <unk> sometimes people i mean it actually i would <unk> i wouldn't expect them to have any trouble finding something 'cause j. p. is quite up with all the all these things  
plastic i think  
as it is it colour wise and is it spongy  
so  
he'll he'll just be working with robin on what analysis we need to get out of the g. d. f. format  
okay  
and this has to be harder because when it falls it mu mu must not burst  
it's  
yeah  
okay  
so we're ready to close that and go back to our  
it could probably do it <unk>  
to  
maybe we should just continue  
yeah  
well i guess we have a little little time extra but just a little quick discussion to to open open our work  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so we could fix it like <unk> that it's like this  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
it doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important  
yeah sounds pretty good  
if want  
or not  
but again yeah i think once you see the spectrum if it's just pure and stable  
because the operating <unk> of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of l. c. d. right  
but you know that's  
it doesn't have to be something that's specific  
i think they're about ten po ten pound aren't they  
we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over  
you are going to try to to find the user requirements <unk> uh for the remote control  
okay  
so that is raid one  
yes  
yeah  
okay  
uh  
see this  
yes real real good colours  
mm  
uh we don't have any changes do we  
yeah  
do you want the cable  
okay  
we should have them in a couple of weeks  
you know your remote control just sits there and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit  
they don't know about the other one  
'cause yeah that gives you a seven which ruins your your average  
yeah  
right  
mm  
yeah  
there you go  
and again to <unk> uh decode it  
so twelve euro fifty we got two off of the battery we can't do anything about that  
mm-hmm  
it's not gonna be multi functional  
okay  
but this is what you can do  
so at the moment i'm looking at act actually the g. d. f. format itself um and then to generate the g. d. f. format i'm gonna be taking stuff out of the <unk> <unk> um and then using a dom parser to generate uh x. m. l. output from the <unk> <unk>  
or if you go to the site it's channel up channel down  
here we can  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah th  
i will make one in the next uh twenty minutes  
nope  
yeah  
after that we'll have lunch  
no i think it's clear  
i would  
mm-hmm  
on the left  
but most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all  
huh  
so you say two  
we could go comp yeah  
okay  
yeah  
i'm i'm not so concerned about the <unk> a meeting plus something else i'm more talking about like yeah  
you'd need a display on the th the thing  
yeah so an information which topic they're in yeah  
yeah  
hey what else  
okay well what do you two think about this  
there are other aspects like l. c. d. screens and speech recognition which weren't  
okay  
um looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber  
it's just making use of the same space and the same materials but  
okay thanks  
i think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow so yellow  
full screen  
uh-huh  
if we yeah  
that's just now just we could just discuss how the project went  
uh  
well we can as as i  
yeah in my own uh in my own messenger  
mm-hmm  
there we go and there are the marks  
took the advanced chip to <unk> uh implement the advanced features  
no no no i'm just uh you can <unk> you can read it and uh here here it is  
so but anyway i i wanted to hear something maybe from you what you are doing <unk> with speech coding because you were you mentioned that  
oh similar types uh-huh  
i if you say one he switch to channel yeah  
there are two files  
yeah that's right  
so everything is open  
um it's very easy to use  
and you said the lowest  
yeah  
oops  
maybe quickly remind what the shot detector is how the shot detector is working basically  
send me yeah yeah okay  
no  
mm  
remote controls children proof  
uh the second point  
yeah that's our last step  
yeah that shouldn't be a problem  
for example if <unk> if you want to put wood i wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's i think it's <unk>  
oops  
back it this is just had to be changed  
broad line region you are right  
yeah sure  
you mean officially  
this one is for the presentations the <unk> presentations or the word presentation of whatever you uh you had  
the number <unk> well yes that's alright  
yeah  
you could basically make it so that it'll i mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the t. v. yeah the t. v. <unk> <unk> so if you send about five flip channels  
one is finishing  
mm-hmm  
nokia <unk>  
i think i think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of you know  
yeah  
you can throw it to the television  
uh these are the new colours of this year  
because having <unk> long steady <unk> can be informative  
just an idea  
hmm  
of course the signal differs accordingly  
thank you mister manager  
and i have some pictures of the inside workings but uh i don't want to get too technical because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you  
or even if it consists any special characters  
but  
open it there  
<unk> right  
'kay and um another thing that i think is important is the <unk> the design of the product how it feels in your hand  
i'm jen  
is this a <unk> multi functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it  
maybe it's one because of the  
we could use a basic battery but that brings with it like they need to be recharged and the bulk the size of it as well  
it's a bit uh bit a pity  
yeah yeah you can  
we haven't completely left anything out so  
stick to the first two parts  
we have a presentation  
and 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it  
okay  
it's not very strong  
yeah okay  
good  
i want to see  
so that's good  
okay  
like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet  
okay  
centre on the same point  
mm-hmm  
like magnitude of hilbert envelope  
well then <unk> you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can  
oh okay okay  
but in fact yeah when i think now we could have uh  
yeah yeah the they they designed the data such a way that it's it's really like really real uh data  
at least half a second or yeah  
and they're both nice views  
it does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed  
yeah  
<unk> easier too 'cause you can  
hmm  
right  
and then after we after we've found out what we can like  
yeah yeah ex if you have the same decomposition but  
by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things  
with seven being false we did not achieve that  
but you get the idea  
yeah  
so marketing  
um so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons  
well more more information in the beginning  
mm  
okay  
like who have most of the money nowadays do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote  
so this residual letter is for full gyro samples  
so we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people  
two  
yeah  
is  
um  
so um so i'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go  
oh okay  
okay so when we are talking about them then my story they are the worst i think  
what are you doing for your d. m. project  
i had to fit it in  
i think you probably should  
anyway and it says lotus elise so you know that it's definitely about car but it's only got two words  
right  
okay  
yeah  
yeah whatever  
it's it's a kind of setting i think  
is that because that's the view  
mm-hmm  
but this is basically detecting speech and no non speech  
it's it's not so uh popular now  
okay so so barney the banana  
yeah  
um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons  
<unk> uh next meeting starts in thirty minutes  
yeah  
yeah yeah you can we can go  
we're improving uh yeah  
it's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control  
yeah me too  
yeah  
to use yeah  
so now more more cool aspect  
so  
i'm glad you're accepting this  
when they'll come to that position the second the third feet will be there  
let's move on  
this is the <unk> so  
i  
yeah  
user interface designer  
right  
i mean that's just the way you want it  
oh  
mm  
i guess it's possible  
what is what fruit or <unk> is flat  
a <unk> uh some mm  
continuum <unk> yeah we're doing that yeah  
yeah  
well  
right  
yeah unless you know you like having conversation with your remote control  
alright  
selling price  
screen shots  
mm-hmm  
we still have one more meeting  
no  
so it's above forty i guess  
so you wanted to talk something more than that  
um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple  
yeah  
like the utterance before the utterance itself and the utterance after  
um i have nothing on my screen  
mm  
okay so we're we're going business to consumer not we're we're it's not a  
um i think you should use kinetic as a back up  
do you think that's feasible  
what's d. a.  
and we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on animal  
yeah  
<unk> perhaps my list of agreements  
yeah  
because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point  
yep  
ah there we go  
words in stuttering  
do you know what h. v. c. stands for  
yeah  
you don't have to be point directly at the television itself  
oh  
yeah it's not working  
you have all the <unk> lines of actually lots of different elements and you have to work out at all the ones <unk> which are ion lines  
yeah i received an email so i thought i i can't mail you so i thought i'd just drop it in the folder but  
so that i'm act there's actually a <unk> a separate file of the data format which says for each construct  
oh okay  
yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options you can put that in the screen  
what  
supposedly  
yeah  
uh in some case it <unk> differs 'cause uh when we exchange knowledge we might not challenge uh the speaker  
okay  
in addition to that  
yeah and by well by just by moving the <unk> uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy  
yeah i i don't know about the search functionality that might be online  
but um well we can go uh because of the time uh pretty quick through this  
so that's gives an idea of why basically in terms of recognition it doesn't really help because you always use anyway the same words  
yeah but a t. v. of course  
um it you 'cause you mentioned face plates  
yes  
are they difficult to understand or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well  
like with those words already on it  
okay  
and then it'll just be a matter of adding new video <unk> mouse movements or whatever  
mm-hmm  
it uh  
divided by  
find out information about speech recognition  
mm-hmm  
you said we need the  
<unk> um i've not encountered them  
yeah  
oh it's okay  
so it's it's scrambled so you can scramble the image and you get the same histogram  
yeah yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going  
it's a it's a normal battery or  
yeah  
yeah  
oh we ca yeah yeah we'll still have the are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down  
okay  
a remote control  
mm-hmm  
so we ha yes  
okay  
first of all i didn't think uh that we were able to make an l. c. d. screen uh first point but uh it was possible uh uh yeah  
okay so <unk> i think we really do have to put the threshold quite quite high then because  
is the device easy to use  
<unk> yeah  
yes  
hi  
yeah  
although i'd be curious to see how many uh  
and uh it's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings  
number  
yeah  
more busy i would say  
what was bad  
mm  
mm  
i i yeah  
okay  
i i dry read it the last time  
the remote control has <unk> <unk> removable from <unk>  
uh in edinburgh they had that big fire and then  
okay  
so it's oh  
this i pretty much covered  
right  
questions  
it doesn't tell me  
so that would be convenient if that just if there's just one of that 'cause otherwise it's getting messy  
right  
yeah  
slick slick  
i just received it  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yes yeah  
the shape of it  
because the trend goes faster than the life of the  
hmm  
yeah this is what we've just done  
mm-hmm  
oh actually well  
um  
yeah  
yeah i suppose that's true  
because yeah it's it's again you don't know  
for whatever reason breaks down after a certain amount of time do you just replace it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
or do you have a specific thing that okay  
yeah  
yeah  
so i think we have even with this it's reasonable  
and that's it  
yeah because right now i don't have price in in head but for next meeting i'm sure yeah be able to do that  
the the the thing about doing it through cross validation or something like that with the task is uh the problem with doing a page rank style algorithm is that is that it gets better it it <unk> better and it gives you better results  
then uh  
um  
generally all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance  
it has to be  
there is no echo or something like <unk> <unk> in the signal if you really go down with that compression factor to like zero point one something that  
well  
no no but c. d. m. is there but now slowly they're introducing g. s. m. also now in u. s. like  
the basics  
and if you have it li in the middle your hand might be over it  
the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative  
need a need a calculator for that  
i i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept  
i it has it is useful  
just sit still i guess for a little while  
th that's the i think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel  
hmm  
so that's maybe a a two for ease of use  
no  
this design project  
we're okay  
i mean it was all about the domain task  
but they like soft materials uh so we might uh we have to consider that  
or what you have to do then you have to decrease the the the size of not one second  
uh energy or information to the chip which is also controlled by the users  
that's just the basic <unk> technical function  
so  
and then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here  
or uh  
um  
a chairman  
that's so that's that means that the <unk> is not uh optimal right  
yeah  
but you can have an button for child lock  
okay  
uh yeah  
square buttons  
handy  
and maybe like it's hand shaped  
maybe i can draw like  
yeah  
so i think we probably should  
inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion  
<unk>  
mm  
uh how it works and what the end user is gonna want from this product  
basic information we need  
okay  
we can just keep doing that  
have you seen the <unk>  
i forget her name  
um  
mm-hmm  
just beeps  
no problem  
but i don't know  
yes  
alright we have to make a decision now because we don't have much time  
it's flat  
yeah  
kind of like like hmm  
yeah  
and there's a ping  
<unk>  
nope we're all set  
yeah i always lose my yeah so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my t. v. so it would be  
with the <unk>  
i don't know  
you guys worried about it  
and in my case it would say some name for the segment and then you would just click on it and then like the whole thing would kick in  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
mm but three should be in  
so  
you know like uh so  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yep  
'kay we can  
yeah the speech possibility the colours  
but the the colours are um basic like yellow red um blue  
the last remote you'll ever buy  
there you go  
next to that i kinda miss a zero actually  
okay  
yeah  
okay yeah  
yeah  
okay  
oh wait  
mm  
so with that we'd kind of by pass any problems with  
do you want do you want me to send you a mail  
<unk> just uh okay  
let's call it the <unk> the construct existing construct which could be zero  
number number one for the first criteria  
it's okay  
so even i think uh then you can have whatever band width is  
um and we've sorted of discussed costs um  
so ah by the way i receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you  
five minutes to end of meeting  
sup i suppose m. f. c. c. no uh not m. f. c. c. but m. <unk> m. f. c.  
uh  
yeah  
because when you add another part construct one ceases to exist and you get construct two right  
did i tell you that we've got kind of two way interaction  
ninety five percent is not good enough though  
hmm  
yeah  
but that's that's  
right  
fifteen oh too bad  
yeah  
could we stretch no still it's not shaped like a banana is  
yeah  
<unk> not gonna get away with that one  
huh  
hmm  
i went here i stayed here  
no i i never got that  
um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um well you know your <unk> your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it  
if you save it in there we can open it up from here  
and no added value  
can you pass the mouse please  
yeah  
um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say volume control changing channels  
yeah  
um i don't know what that means we crank it  
no both start with s. but  
ah <unk> fuck you  
hmm  
you know <unk> some sort of physical something or other  
oh i think it's uh um <unk> <unk> <unk> starting with um <unk> european i think  
then uh i mean uh uh this is totally new  
that's a phase further  
mm  
yeah  
sound  
so then i the story was that then uh <unk> presented that at so some meeting and we <unk> oh  
oh okay  
so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing  
we want it to be a <unk> a ball you know we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located  
mm  
i mean that's just the same thing as i gave yeah as i gave to you  
here um the button there and there  
and and then we could have like some type of just point in the end where the one scores from the all the individual word cells get multiplied all with like for each utterance or whatever  
yeah  
because you cancelled it  
take it  
it will be difficult to say just the name of the channel  
uh we looked that up and i for we looked that up and i forgot  
sure  
i kind of want one  
mm-hmm  
yeah mm  
okay  
so we <unk> our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their v. c. r. <unk>  
um  
um here's the agenda for our last meeting  
to discuss uh yeah the project alexandre and uh jean marc uh proposed  
<unk> we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know  
you got a problem so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed  
ah pinball  
right  
mm-hmm  
two  
and now it's up to designing  
mm  
come on  
yeah it's it's <unk> way above um uh above the the the twelve euro fifty  
the only thing i can draw is like this  
then we will uh evaluate the product  
yeah  
'cause everybody i have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button  
thanks  
is it it's a a sort of composite uh viewing time  
do they have a lo oh the here  
which basically has the same functionality but lacks the l. c. d. screen  
but just one thing  
which might be more less like it's source coding and then we also channel coding because we just smooth the or just i don't know  
so you're talking about like when it leaves our <unk> then it's all gonna be cherry coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it  
okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do look like  
mm-hmm  
so actually a time change would automatically put the position of the display in the right play  
okay  
fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan  
and then you have a power button which <unk> volume what you have  
you've decided not to make all the triangles red and squares green and  
yep  
ca can you uh say a number  
oh dear  
so i mean that'll be interesting  
mm  
but we ha <unk> we don't uh use our <unk> uh we uh removable cover  
but then you have the problem when you have a titanium back you can't switch it  
so we decided to have it uh yes thirty centimetre uh at each side  
yeah  
you uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach  
uh you said twenty five minutes but i have something else to do uh  
and you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically <unk> innovative  
ma i i think uh for next meeting we <unk> you two can present a real design  
hmm  
it's because if we want to  
right  
mm  
how many of them did you get right  
when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind  
and and just put it under the screen the screen  
so there's a layer of rubber on the side  
it's just t. t. s. right text to speech  
which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television  
okay  
mm-hmm  
like that  
okay there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it  
um seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly  
can't get in look all around the kitchen  
i don't like the colours  
for this you can tune it's for tune  
like either put either one one on either side or  
mm-hmm  
i think  
i mean i you would have thought they could but it's <unk> it's actually quite hard work  
but lyman alpha forest should be in here because it's not talking about uh <unk> it's not modified  
and and him  
yeah  
the main critical point is here  
uh if you find some good paper which you might  
uh i i'm i'm in agreement with that i'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device  
so  
i think it's a good idea  
so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work  
so  
that's a good question because you will be leaving question marks there  
so you could uh uh uh  
wait what's the scale one to seven right  
but you say do you need to do some segmentation also on top of that so  
if we go further we might distinguish uh the interactivity between two <unk> three or all the groups  
the size and the the shape  
um  
a <unk> upgrade or something but from where  
yeah  
yeah <unk> probably  
the easiest way  
um then i tell something about um the most important issues  
and do not use too many levels  
how much time do we have for this anyway  
it may even return a file directly  
well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit <unk> stage as to uh how much <unk> how much how much how pliable is <unk>  
so let's now go to the you don't have more question  
oh  
it's a pork  
no interface  
so  
at the <unk>  
uh  
no  
uh before i do that however  
and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics  
it's circuit board  
it is o. k. a. y.  
but yeah  
i mean i don't see why that's really a big problem  
this sample sensor  
well okay alright  
or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five i think they will be bored after a while  
or is that a 'cause uh yeah it's well probably is  
the whole thing lights up if you press any button rather than it just that one button will light up  
so what we've identified here as our main marketing <unk> is is in design  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
no  
like in terms of holding it  
so that's that's a dark blue basic colour i guess  
what ab what ab what about a  
it's fancy  
ah you have to ah okay i see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana  
does have a name  
uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it um could be  
first point begins with an e. same like ebenezer  
so if you did something so maybe it would be interesting at least to  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet  
it is  
what the hell's that  
yeah  
yeah i think it's a bit complex too  
yeah  
and it combines with product evaluation  
mm-hmm  
okay <unk> <unk>  
mm  
um they should be technological in innovative  
but not everybody go  
okay  
even  
um no no no  
yep  
uh and i am just using it through um a windows bolt on sort of piece of software  
yeah  
so which one does  
so what are we doing with the settings  
that's the actually usually  
um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost uh that's one thing we could look at  
yeah <unk> this is this would be like um  
mm  
large  
i'll have to look up you know so  
because we've every feature is produced by a process  
mm  
yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand  
yeah yeah  
so the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons  
and why is that  
prototype  
i'm trying to think of a good pun that i could add there  
yeah how much is it  
right  
so i <unk> i think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this  
and the rest is the same huh  
so this  
makes it a lot easier huh  
yeah yeah  
sure  
and you're right there  
huh  
yeah yeah  
but what <unk> is there some extra maybe i think maybe the kinetic thing is something  
do you need a this  
so if we need to have a target group um then uh i think as far as the <unk> motto of our company is concerned  
and  
yeah  
oh  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
maybe a pineapple  
festival is open  
tod uh for this meeting i will take the notes and do the minutes  
yeah  
yeah to be able to si to sell it  
unless uh things have suddenly change again  
yeah  
okay so  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
huh cool  
everything else being equal it took the first ones more or less  
yeah  
it's not the ultimate uh fancy two but  
mm-hmm  
yeah but insert image isn't available  
yeah you can then you know because if most did it on what numbers and one of couple of c. t. f. experiments right  
um  
from that to give you your profit margin per unit  
you're not you're not obliged to share it  
okay so  
um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work uh and i'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it  
fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex  
that's what i mean  
yeah  
and and does it  
th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about um  
yeah  
try uh flipping the screen down  
current colour you can choose another colour  
i think it's that little  
uh all of the like hundreds of thousands of pages point to that but they're about completely different things  
so what's our corporate image like  
twenty five euros  
okay  
uh sinclair and coulthard  
and we have to use the pen and the eraser  
it uh  
that's it  
and that could allow <unk> easy navigation used as a joystick as well  
yeah okay  
on yeah you you can suggest points like this  
well we're not doing frame rate at any frame for well maybe we are  
or how <unk> alright  
okay  
and <unk> yeah that's just bad  
anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know so have to  
okay go  
man yeah  
yeah  
some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes and it'll be like flip flip flip  
it's better to to have this like this i guess and then flip it like this  
hand light yeah  
mm-hmm  
easy to use is it uh  
and maybe take the opportunity to look just a moment uh at what point we are and <unk> when we plan basically to get something uh done and working  
oh  
as an as an outcome of this is that you could <unk> either end and you'd get the same <unk> of the material  
i'd say probably a good way of going about that question is to have a control which we can vary in the dis and then just sort of because that's in the end how it's gonna be evaluated  
forget about everything else and go with that  
simple and plain but i mean i do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality so in that respect it is quite fancy  
oh five minutes to the end of the meeting  
they will i th they'll help in the case of discourse marking but his point was that they're really subjective  
right  
yeah everything is lost yeah  
oh okay  
we've got some  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah t. v. yeah  
so being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility  
okay  
<unk> okay okay i  
no  
it was our idea you know to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it  
but would it have that in the <unk> version then like would it <unk> would the output be the <unk> version  
uh and <unk> and get the most cheapest uh thing  
it's very intuitive i think yeah  
then the old and rich  
oh  
if you wanna see the next uh if you wanna see that channel  
alright  
uh i know  
and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because i don't wear it all the time  
we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes  
so you just flip them out  
and sometimes they have a hump  
um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face  
i'm not sure  
mm-hmm  
cutbacks  
okay  
of the remote control itself okay  
uh yeah  
i mean  
tone it down  
you know one second it's usually mixed right somehow together  
and then have that x. m. l. uh nite x. m. l. document tied to the interface  
yeah  
oh yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
it's really <unk> really uh yeah so see suppose if thirty nine in <unk> thirty nine to thirty nine for every yeah yeah so  
yep  
yeah we don't know if the uh they're necessary  
and there's no buttons at all it's always on and just yell at it and it works  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
like you know new like higher band width transmission or uh or like packet <unk> based transmission  
i don't know  
with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over  
mm neither do i  
mm  
something we should probably ask before we do it  
yeah well the  
well she noticed that most of them have rooms alone  
okay  
of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw <unk> in the last meeting  
yeah  
this is the most important button  
so if it's quite clear that the sentence is being carried on the <unk> you know  
okay  
um we have three presentations i heard  
so <unk> we can go back and <unk> talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment  
<unk> yeah  
are they are interested in that or no  
anyway  
um so i'll list the three most important aspects that i've come across  
mm 'kay  
oh well that all sounds good  
if you want to keep it simple you can make a universal remote  
okay  
mm-hmm  
not too much <unk> not <unk> not too <unk> not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different  
it's worse and worse  
but it's still a <unk> feature even if it's not it might be a <unk> feature i not in the cloud  
how about uh management or something  
uh i'm going away for two weeks on the fourth of april  
that's almost <unk>  
double s. a. yeah yeah  
we weren't doing broad band <unk> yeah  
seems a bit stupid  
slightly more serious stuff  
mm-hmm  
mm  
when it's <unk> the same as the other products you can put it all on the same uh  
yeah that is pretty neat  
yeah  
um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation  
so we'll see  
um  
yeah yeah  
hmm  
mm  
'kay we'll just have to do that  
it's only the first ideas  
okay  
uh i did a project on cats in the wild when i was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat  
well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally <unk>  
so are we doing just the television or are we doing so not d. v. d. players we okay okay  
you can be you can go quicker 'cause then it it won't notice it  
and i don't know if you can read it but it says step go to freeze  
and we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts  
yes  
for the speech recognition you you don't need anything  
uh plastic would be the material  
no  
mm yes  
'kay ready to go  
maybe a bit higher  
uh <unk> yeah  
right well done catherine  
so  
cool yeah  
'cause i ordered <unk>  
yeah  
<unk> because uh nobody has <unk> remote control they're always black yeah but this one could be i dunno purple or <unk>  
'cause uh isn't our remote control for  
right  
hmm  
so sorry  
no it's <unk> just signals uh and the television <unk> uh does the rest  
it's not the thing we should go for i think  
and i'll just check  
yeah  
young means sixteen to forty years  
well it's close enough isn't it  
so for us this is quite easy  
perhaps my list of agreements somewhere  
yeah  
four centimetres  
<unk> we don't want lots of buttons uh complicated features  
uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler  
well yes and no as in yes it's new and no i haven't got a problem  
why should i uh  
um  
oh colour yeah  
could you re could you redesign your board  
but you guys came up with a great product and at that cost i think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together  
mm  
ta da  
and what the <unk> young people want is uh in paris and and in milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy  
um <unk> just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques  
a base station  
because it's basically an old one uh with little curve on the side and in a different colour  
hmm  
oh no no it's still good because um  
and uh  
but  
i know  
maybe like i don't know  
i think like a really shiny black would be cool  
and the power is basically a factor of that  
no  
yeah yeah  
multifunctional  
such as yeah the one the one over there on the left the engineering <unk> one  
uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh  
<unk> <unk> what  
maybe someone ha we have to this <unk> yeah  
yeah i noticed  
so i it's sorry  
kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the <unk> um that it should be a simple mass produced device  
although only used once per hour  
yeah  
mm yeah sure  
i don't know that's  
well maria is full time  
i'm here full time now so i'll i'll be here <unk> monday through friday and i <unk> i leave at four now  
okay uh about what i found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control  
we <unk>  
this is from our time segment <unk> here to this time segment there  
yep  
they want the ergonomic ones  
think it's  
okay  
and uh about the colour what have  
okay yeah that looks good  
mm 'kay  
yep  
and also it's mostly like how to how many l. p. c. <unk> are yeah how many co yeah it's <unk> and then it's even  
i think you could probably group plastic and rubber together wood and titanium  
yeah  
if someone is staying here but is quiet or leaving how can we detect that someone is here but quiet  
okay  
okay yeah and <unk> then i can make files of that  
into the chip which basically finds out <unk> uh how how to do everything  
'cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom  
ah  
yeah  
so uh  
okay  
<unk> know really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum you know possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off  
wants  
no no  
and as i said it's perfect  
that's all  
and when it come you don't want to change the file name in any way  
it's basically a way of saying the <unk> petersen <unk> it's a way of saying the <unk> petersen trough though  
um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet  
that's true yeah  
uh play pause doesn't <unk> need to be there  
okay  
that should be fairly easy to do right  
um this is the chip itself which then and that's the that's the infra red  
so what is the next step  
so any of you have experience in remote controls  
and make it uh  
oh okay  
a project  
but the rest of it is  
anyone has their remote controls here  
i thought that was our uh idea  
and once you go over about a hundred maybe two hundred topics  
yeah but on the l. c. d. huh  
twelve and a half  
okay  
oh <unk>  
and one five  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
maybe health and safety aspects  
okay  
i think if i had spaces for the um new values so when i went to do correlation it wouldn't work anymore  
so the battery we have um advanced chip on print  
yeah  
interface type  
um  
shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and <unk> that there's a preference for spongy tight material  
so then it would be you'd be watching charmed and then the sky <unk> would come on and it would change to sky  
and seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly  
i i won  
right  
yeah no <unk> they want all those words for presentation even the plugs  
fact i'll see if i can um yeah it's useful to know who's got a current one anyway  
or is are you expecting do most the analysis on out of the n. x. t. stuff then  
you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour i guess  
i don't uh  
no well first yeah  
and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system  
i don't see we could've made it any easier  
which is what was causing the bugs uh before  
yeah  
it's very important to uh keep up with latest trends  
mm  
voila  
so  
yeah  
instead of the current uh functional look and feel  
yeah well that's that are good ideas  
i don't think so  
i  
in fashion  
that's very good idea  
a standard  
alright so for the electronics our choices are <unk> simple chip on print regular chip on print advanced chip on print sample sensor sample speaker  
yeah  
well if we're gonna dump the part of it into a database anyway  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
and i thought it that's the guy from c. s. l. u. from portland who was there during <unk>  
um how <unk> how does a remote control look and feel for them and what improvements would would they like to remote control  
easy for checking at any rate rather than having to listen to a whole anything  
which is to have it so that we can play and we can make a nice demo and so on with the full uh thing and something  
yeah i think we all need the raw text in different in different <unk> don't we  
and uh yeah i think this is the <unk>  
to see them with the respective assistants and i think <unk> plus marianne is a very good combination  
mm  
and you are reading from the <unk> you always read from the top to the the bottom of it  
and uh the feeling has to be very great  
yeah i thought those last minute things they're gonna hit you the worst  
so we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh  
yeah  
that's rather sad  
okay  
yeah  
how about these  
and the event's gonna have whatever all whatever the object uh is that's being looked at and things  
well you can't really because it would be all of it  
um the well are you thinking it's been a while since i've read this literature  
yeah  
okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left so i'm i'm gonna  
mm  
th there i uh let's say if you use a one second window  
um other views  
the <unk> the problem with the okay button in the middle is sorry  
mm-hmm  
yep  
okay so i'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy  
yes  
mm-hmm okay  
yeah so to help you make cuts just look look <unk> you know use this wave form and make sure you're not <unk> losing any signal information  
<unk> number  
yeah or maybe you want a touch screen or  
i missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops  
sorry  
knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that  
then when whatever your algorithm is doing as long as when you're working with utterances you go for all the leaves  
now lower  
people's work that you um  
i think i'd give it a four too  
so  
and and  
and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far  
<unk>  
that's when i left  
'kay  
um by not using the voice recognition feature because it's uh it's a four euro uh addition to the price  
yep  
screwed in quite tightly  
i'm not so sure  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
it's uh it's uh i i i must do it  
and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose  
'kay i'll just give you a minute 'cause it looks like you're making some notes  
'cause that just ends up taking too much time  
yeah true  
um <unk> this is a lot of text  
hmm  
you now have as much information as i do  
or i are the summaries sort of refined from it and made by a machine to make sentences and stuff  
there's two identical triangles in the <unk>  
yeah alright  
and then we can see like well without you know these tags so you know  
okay  
a laptop  
well  
this is yeah  
this is possible  
the project documents  
so  
but but isn't that important  
save as project  
and channel which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it like  
that's what i'm guessing that's you know  
no maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly  
oh  
yeah  
i uh had uh two examples  
<unk> last one <unk> i would like to judge is  
it doesn't it could it could be a tactile thing as well  
well no it's okay  
well that's <unk> up to uh mister user interface designer  
okay  
yeah  
or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control what do you think of the look of it  
yeah yeah  
okay  
but yeah then you have like the little se separate module by the t. v. speaker  
and let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple  
yeah i think that would be <unk> i mean uh for me it's quite difficult to say <unk> on  
yeah  
so you forgot how this works again  
volume control  
yeah functional requirements  
yeah  
so  
the  
yeah  
well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive  
sorry  
i think  
but <unk> yeah i  
more expensive and yeah  
yeah  
i think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway to make it more simplistic  
so yeah  
i'm just saying that uh once you have done this for a given time frame you can have a direction of the person at least in terms of sector  
i  
mm-hmm  
that was what i <unk> i thought yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
it's i don't think it's perfect but we did everything possible to to get it back  
and that would be or solar  
for the  
yeah um <unk>  
but what about um something that's built into the t. v. um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep  
so we have the two options we can follow either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber depending on cost restraints  
would it be easier though because all your methods are sort of not working with their whole time frame structure there  
though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle  
well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that solar cell has to be has to be like kept  
so i'll put it in there  
yeah  
bless you  
cool  
and uh we will be able to process to post process some conversation just to see what happens and to uh have these um models on feedback working when people are using the table  
four  
but it gives you a very clear picture of what's going on  
rubber buttons  
uh at some point targeting two kayaks and it's moving quite fast towards to other people  
view  
if you have uh some presentation and you have some <unk>  
i think we shall have a limited number of buttons ideally i mean a a power  
yeah  
no i don't think so  
yep  
we don't want wood  
um we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting um  
so you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume  
okay  
and then it must be easy to use  
then you will need more than twenty minutes to present it i guess  
well that's quite cool  
okay  
we implemented the basic functions which is just t. v. functions plus the locator which was one of the marketing things cradle  
alright  
no  
i think that's a closer  
just a review of current systems uh to introduce  
these numbers all work independently up to nine  
yes  
yeah  
but i mean uh they're hidden in the screen  
or even a clear case  
okay  
not shared  
<unk> menu  
then it's not good anymore  
but we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons or i dunno  
um when he is not here we will just we just have to continue  
to prepare okay yeah that's good  
yeah  
the front side no no <unk> no slogan  
no  
i mean  
i just wanna watch the t. v. um  
but the ex  
so if it's two groups then it probably it's gonna be roughly half an hour ish  
okay  
um giant <unk> or <unk>  
just put a special special colour of the buttons or something  
mm uh nothing special  
uh they call it negotiation  
ah it's alright  
so i have to take this questionnaire  
for for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve euros fifty  
and so i had something with without very many um <unk> not little flying in and things because that would just make it really difficult  
okay  
nah there is some money left to be spent  
yeah  
i i don't have a laptop  
it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down  
overlap you mean  
i'm listening  
then uh mike can uh give the third presentation  
uh  
but  
so  
then you and then you've got a flag <unk> very big r. c.  
okay  
we did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that  
mm  
yeah that's fine i'm happy with all that  
yep  
and for the video we have the video input here  
i uh that work  
of our prototype  
and the communication with the t. v. set is uh made through uh infrared communication  
yeah <unk> available  
mm  
yeah  
like the l. c. d. screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this  
mm-hmm  
okay my turn  
mm  
but no  
yeah  
yeah  
oh  
oh okay  
technologically innovative  
one two three  
so when is your turn  
doesn't matter  
and and but we don't have to tell it  
mm  
uh 'cause i 'cause uh <unk> just so at least i can see how it works with the h. t. m. l. pages so i can generate um the x. so i can generate x. h. t. m. l. stuff and see how it all works there  
i was because here you can see that the motion uh here is uh you know he is uh doing a zoom on the two kayaks here  
okay now well how much time have we got left  
it's not up to that  
oh no i <unk> i put it in one of my <unk> mails that i sent off  
mm  
mm  
yes sure  
it's possible  
mm  
no  
but um well <unk> my preference would to be put it in the menu structure  
yeah  
yeah definitely  
hmm  
it it it has a nice screen  
it's uh in in the house isn't it i suppose  
maybe that wasn't uh her re starting maybe <unk> that was  
and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers so even though we need a small number of buttons  
let's just use the acronyms  
and it's round  
uh they well they dumped it on the mm b. s. c. c. w. server  
well this is the agenda for today  
people uses on regular basis daily basis or  
i mean that would be no problem  
um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable <unk> even if it's the yellow and grey um  
i'm sure we'll be busy  
well let's think about that while we talk about the case  
so that's our concept  
okay  
that's a bit oh that that's that's pretty cool  
yeah  
right  
mm-hmm  
more features yeah  
may maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here  
so i guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked  
not too expensive too  
he was saying that we should maybe uh think about having a prototype for week six which is next week  
okay true yeah  
isn't it a process  
yes  
uh easy to find in a room  
um as far as i'm aware we leave the microphones here um unless we get told otherwise and just take the laptops with us  
no  
maybe even single just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow  
and how much time is left  
i just keep forgetting it  
it's mm-hmm  
um uh they especially found found them very ugly  
out  
my original idea was just simply  
yeah  
'kay  
yeah  
or roughly  
so hurry up  
for <unk> for you your designing  
well no  
yeah  
you th you think it's possible  
like two tone colour  
there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones not too many pretty remote controls  
no  
mm  
okay  
to the d. c. d.  
emission line candidates  
yeah maybe on the side  
i think one that works would be good  
like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long  
does that sound reasonable  
mm they have to read numbers from  
export as j. peg  
yeah the yeah  
do you know if anywhere else has it  
where the <unk> very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons  
yes  
okay  
um i'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um  
um and i i also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually i i quite like the idea of a scroll a <unk> button  
you could use this to save two documents uh in the same directory or not  
um let's see oh it isn't asked to save but it did already  
i give you ideas you guys create the product  
and the <unk> yeah the pen doesn't uh really does what i want  
yeah yeah  
so the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the <unk> languages  
so i think that's  
mm-hmm  
thanks  
oh okay  
yeah or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel  
um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting  
mm-hmm  
seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something  
so we'll we'll get we'll get the get the audio stuff tested you know single microphones  
higher numbers  
because one of the <unk> uh things that cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it  
if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever you know <unk> we yeah i guess we can play around with it a bit  
the other woman um from <unk> you know they talked about  
okay so in our <unk> lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah  
then uh there is no meaning in having it on the t. v.  
that's your field of expertise  
there are a lot of option there are a lot more options  
that would be great  
yeah  
so you propose to to have the  
uh the one before the third meeting  
well i started making an overview for myself um what i had to do  
so it's uh two and three nine two and one third  
i'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design  
this seems the sort of thing that people might might find i find amusing to look at  
i i'll be the project manager  
so if you need to borrow a head that talks that doesn't necessarily need to do much else  
we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements whether it meets the user requirements or not this product  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
gosh  
marketing you could <unk> find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there  
i think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool  
no no  
yeah  
um other features things like adjusting the brightness tuning the t. v. uh i don't know what else you do with a t. v.  
and here i think i'm right again  
so we are at seventeen dot eight  
i think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money  
but yeah those things are practically kind of really but i think this kind of things what you showed i mean what you said is really good  
and then last one's marketing which is me  
yeah  
you say three and you you said al also three  
and then once they contribute it then that company can break down the part the parts better  
all the results  
that's probably more what it is  
so that's  
on the menu structure  
right  
yeah  
right yeah  
yeah  
and i'm in <unk> of keeping the rubber because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has  
uh it's still a bit open  
in this one okay  
yeah  
um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting  
can't really take it into the other room  
but would you then not get the typical words for every speaker  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah over here  
you're going to draw  
that sounds good  
okay  
<unk> emission lines  
half and hour  
our target market  
yeah  
how surprising  
'cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to  
sure  
um  
uh maybe we will <unk> we <unk> will not able to be continuous  
g. yeah j. peg  
to the customers  
so kind of trick  
you can pick sports you can pick the news you entertainment you know it's like  
okay never mind  
yeah but it's exact the same that <unk> would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button  
anybody  
okay yeah  
right  
and do you get something about the um distance of the guy that is talking or just a direction  
so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um  
it's great  
yeah  
then you only need one button to move back  
okay  
you tape to your to your t. v. um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off  
i forgot that one  
going to be very greasy and stuff  
may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control  
okay so how um sorry can you uh just put that one back up again please  
yeah i think <unk> most  
so we simply used a very old test statistical test  
i uh two three  
i can't 'cause i don't have my glasses on but so we've got the energy source  
it's so brilliant  
mm  
twenties  
because there the screen goes up like that right  
put it outside and if bees come it's really fruit  
but no no  
yeah  
well  
i will go  
ah ha  
great  
did you overtake that code from the original thing  
okay so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi okay  
yeah  
no but it says it covers a significantly small angular size  
go for voice buttons or or a bit of both  
so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology  
thank you  
the voice recognition are not  
well it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down we've got solar power  
uh i mean if if they are oscillating though then that's presumably going to <unk> change the weight  
i'll sell whatever you guys design  
one yeah  
mm-hmm  
oh that's fine  
yeah exactly that  
um you can see whether there's somebody else or not  
no that's true  
so what i and do <unk> is it okay  
it's it's hard to narrow it down  
uh cheap imprint so you <unk> you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well  
oh the the no no no no no that's very important but uh <unk> and not important in the audio settings display settings and uh  
okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven p. m. but we might be able to say um volume up  
but i think this is not really the right moment yet  
so we wanted to uh that's a first thing  
yeah  
well  
yeah but you don't you don't actually need them  
has jokes when it's ready  
child friendly i thought this was good as you pointed out the um  
yes  
perhaps  
mm  
like another mic  
they they won't be visible on the on the <unk> okay  
uh tool training project plan discussion and then closing  
i don't really know about the voice recognition thing  
well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting what we uh thought we had <unk> decided  
alright let's go forward then  
<unk> it's a normal t. v. screen kind of thing  
that's right  
<unk>  
so it depends but i suppose talking to them sometimes solves these problems  
to some degree  
they don't uh they yeah  
so do i unplug this bit here  
everything else is gonna be a standard  
um right we're ready to close  
yep  
yeah  
but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the <unk>  
i mean i think i mean i i think that it's possible to draw some sort of relationship between the two as we were saying  
so that's one the those are the choices we have to make  
and i suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences  
uh it knows exactly what it wants  
uh uh is that what we were  
yeah  
uh  
gentlemen i'm afraid we do not have any more time  
it isn't in my information i uh i i've got a  
yes  
yep  
i mean it's pretty <unk> stupid but they do  
yeah the buttons <unk> like  
well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb of course  
for example if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your t. v. and also you can control your uh recorder  
like this one  
um well push button that's that's the one we're all familiar with  
but is it a <unk> any hesitation  
yep  
yes  
i've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time  
and then use the two functional buttons to confirm to go into something  
and the two uh vis one and vis two are the visitor places  
yeah of course  
the main feature of it is just a simple design simple lack of uh buttons all over the place  
it might also record the kind of uh channels you are <unk> more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them  
mm-hmm  
oh you don't wanna have different counts for each chunk but just like sort of for for something from old chunks  
doesn't say  
mm-hmm  
it seems we're kind of approaching a higher end range  
it's too expensive  
it's um it's safer for them i guess  
alright  
which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal <unk> l. c. d. display  
<unk> what we could do is um  
and you don't have to use the unit you can also put it on the side if people don't like it  
um maybe we could flare it or something  
yeah  
the programme button yeah the programme button  
so she can see we're ready  
it's  
um  
and maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers huh  
so what is the goal of this project  
we only have a few minutes left  
and uh that is about it  
um  
no i just we got the logo off the web browser  
yeah  
and i think we've all um worked that out  
so we'll have to like have a little square or something so that the our <unk> available  
um and that would have some <unk> impact on how <unk> i think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined  
mm-hmm  
for the channels perhaps  
yeah smaller  
we we're doing alright for time  
yeah or a yeah an <unk> an <unk> for b. b. c. two on b. b. c. <unk> switch the channel for you kinda thing  
cohen  
uh-huh  
um <unk> for one for one thing because i do think that the menu system should be um uh i mean although you know  
yeah that's right although you oh it isn't actually used all that often these days i think  
yeah i was a bit slow too  
<unk> i did not  
right okay  
good  
and it's all recorded woo hoo  
so uh ha <unk> is there any sound degradation that comes about from putting this through <unk> rather than running it out straight  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
do i have to explain uh why i chose this uh this animal  
perfect  
yep make sure it uh it starts and finishes when it's meant to and that sort of thing as well  
yeah it's yeah  
well we're going to have a beeping thing  
um  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
but it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh  
no  
sure it's a separate analysis  
um  
your usually your remote sits on that  
we well look at all the special stuff we have  
they had a paper i believe it was not in <unk> a. s. r. u. or something right  
mm  
but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything you know volume control on off  
no i no i i understand what you say but what i'm what i'm okay we probably need to move along but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product  
oh right  
mm-hmm  
and uh and as i also <unk> it depends like also like i think if uh boss is interested in working in both speech and text  
i'll go for three as well  
so more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on t. v.  
yeah  
no but i mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them  
so  
and highly resourceful team mates might i add which is always a plus  
examples of the tool training project plan discussion and the closing  
i don't know  
hmm  
you can take as long over this as you like because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss  
bobby  
so the hard thing is they could be moving their eye arbitrarily here right  
so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip  
but i prefer like a potential meter or something like  
so we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above  
yeah  
and for twenty five euros people want something remote <unk> special from your mote control  
just to get used to the <unk>  
yeah  
um this i don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank  
watermelon red and green or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish  
okay so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting  
you have to you have to because some fat people with <unk> thick fingers will press three buttons at same time  
well do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then  
no mm  
and then we will close this session  
yes  
yeah  
make it harder to lose as well  
yeah that gives you a younger and uh more high tech look i <unk> i figured  
mm-hmm  
so <unk>  
you can do both with both hands  
final view bob  
um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable  
okay  
um  
yeah  
so phase  
yeah intelligent  
yep  
no problem  
you can't you you can't oh you <unk> you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the  
i think it was uh your job in the first uh meet uh  
yeah  
there's more vomit there  
hmm  
<unk> yeah but  
um here's what we're each going to do  
oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and  
mm yeah  
but you are doing the same no  
like for example voice recognition right  
these things  
ooh i love the eraser  
and a special material  
yeah you're  
that's a very unnatural motion to yeah  
we could have it in b. nine but there's things all over the wall  
'kay yes  
so it's a two  
the back  
but i guess ellen was gonna be your the <unk> the person who yeah your spare head  
you broke it  
but um your new goal <unk> was for uh people than less than forty years old  
uh  
fifteen seventeen twenty one twenty four twenty six  
mm-hmm  
so we will send you the papers related  
uh  
oh  
programme information  
yeah  
uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff like uh an l. c. d. screen on the remote control um  
yeah and me also like this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement  
oh  
okay  
so i wouldn't put him in that big office even if he's fifty per cent but he's still a professor here and we got him from e. p. f. l.  
the docking station  
that is uh is easy to hold <unk> in one hand left or right handed  
yeah you can lose it so i don't you can make it a three i  
yeah  
no  
hmm  
are we  
hmm  
larger i think  
uh power button uh channel volume selection  
just maybe to hear something new  
so uh we decided to take  
try to find a theory that allows multiple speakers and relations to span over more than one <unk> you know  
yes  
yeah  
so  
just sort of quiet space out of your office that doesn't have the office furniture  
okay  
um  
yeah  
yeah right  
a fish  
yeah that's no option that's no option  
yeah  
as you can see i mean that's taken up well over half of the price  
so uh and currently i'm more interested in see uh uh yeah <unk> the discourse structure in multi party meetings  
it's not much work  
soft materials is of course uh <unk> again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said  
people people from the age of thirty <unk> there's a big drop off there  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
i think so  
and i mean this is the dialogue act number  
and and you don't have uh scripts for  
two  
of course of course  
yeah  
mm  
their d. v. d. <unk> their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only  
<unk> finance  
um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that but definitely in another colour i'm not happy with those colours  
are are we <unk> <unk> on on the  
yeah  
um the joystick is another thing if we were gonna add that um there'd be more components to deal with that  
right so uh what about the the <unk> uh  
yes  
uh-huh  
um right so take away that completely  
because on most <unk> remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much two years  
i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves  
i'm kind of i'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of  
but i don't know uh how much higher  
it it needs to be calibrated again  
um sends message to another system  
<unk> <unk> <unk> a lot of remote controls work that <unk> when <unk> that you when you fir you push the one first  
yes definitely  
so it makes it possible to uh just put it <unk> uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote  
uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything  
i dunno i'm feeling like a big boy  
well during lunch break actually  
yeah exactly yeah yeah  
oh  
joe could give it a couple of hours which i is what it might take just to fix it  
ca  
yep  
um  
oh  
yeah  
it's now i guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five so we've got until four  
well maybe um some idea on that  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and we  
yeah yeah  
the digital pen is better than the <unk>  
i mean if anyone wants to do a perl script for that that does it does it nicely i uh  
i'm a i'm a i'm a bit brain damaged at the moment but i think i'll just sit together with you again and and go through it again  
okay i think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful so if i want to write it here i think i can  
that's exactly what i was thinking  
yep  
alright  
uh maggie has no objection uh sharing an office with her assistant  
alright i'll see you guys in a minute  
the amount yeah  
i think i think you're throwing information away  
mm  
yeah that looks uh great  
pretty much it  
it can be tolerable yeah  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
easy to use interface buttons menu menus that's yeah that's good  
that  
that tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale  
i have no stake in it  
yeah  
oh my god  
it's not <unk> it's not a <unk> mod it's not an original system  
mm-hmm  
that's the big question yeah  
yeah  
special material  
i don't know  
mm-hmm  
but <unk> he he he is around and i believe  
mm  
at oh dear  
plastic is  
yeah  
not the agenda  
um  
did you consider the <unk> <unk> uh gesture recognition  
once again i was would ask you if it's expensive but apparently you don't have any data  
three like this actually and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like  
okay  
yeah try the summaries constructor  
'kay  
i'd say let's start with the first presentation  
so we've got to discuss that  
uh <unk> i think if they're really serious  
indeed absolutely yes <unk> that's um  
it will do  
i mean i think we  
okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh  
i don't think so  
um yeah it's uh should be easy to use so not not too much <unk> buttons and uh channel selection  
oh external  
<unk> have any have <unk> ha anything to say about that  
and then you have to get the l. p. p. l. p. features and  
yeah  
okay  
i think that yeah  
you can touch options and it's comes out  
um  
grey and rubber  
yes  
okay yeah mm-hmm  
but it has also to it it has also to be uh <unk> uh for for yeah rich people  
these are the three options right  
th could tell you that there is no case where you're gonna be looking for initiation and responses that's gonna work you know  
that's all i wanted to say  
but uh i've got a the email with uh with the possibilities  
so if someone of you comes up with uh ideas uh i'll try to translate them in technical functions but uh there might be some <unk>  
um i'd <unk> i'd rate i'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually  
oh the advanced buttons  
you have the biggest uh  
and then a big spongy pink <unk> tomato uh remote  
i think it is because it has an l. c. d. screen a mi microphone  
yeah it's real it's yeah  
the cost of making it should be twelve and a half  
yeah i mean that was that was sort of in the original of then the nice fancy drawings that we gave steven  
yeah  
uh some uh things  
uh switching on off channel uh volume okay that's great  
uh yeah and what <unk> did we make the management's  
so  
but then we also uh <unk> need to bring out a line of t. v. <unk> which we were planning to but whatever  
mm 'kay um i'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you  
yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that  
yeah  
so the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product  
yeah also if <unk> when you take the the remote control for example on the table  
is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer  
right  
alright  
<unk> <unk>  
yes  
so that did limit  
mm  
mm-hmm  
i thought we're just supposed to use the underscore between letters  
see that as we kinda noticed seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly  
yep  
there's only one message so far  
okay  
brilliantly done  
so now you have with l. c. d. and without l. c. d. so on this scale if it is true  
if we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty five and make a low profit margin on it but we're really doing that to sell the brand  
we can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions  
yeah  
so um you know  
you have to screw up first and then you can bring an extra  
possibly  
we've <unk> definitely talking some type of  
but is it easy to use  
oh  
digital pen i thought uh th the first time i did individual work i used it  
no no no  
can we justify it  
there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time but will be used ten percent of the time yeah  
making the <unk> job a little easier  
i have one n. x. t. question which hopefully won't be well it's not one  
what's this  
is it  
that seem sensible  
mm-hmm  
mm  
um but well we need to redesign uh the product  
uh not  
i mean detect the speech from non speech it will be a little revolution no in the  
okay  
no you <unk>  
th uh there was not a el ask <unk>  
i'd say when it comes to the ergonomics the form and stuff yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average  
yeah  
what else  
that's good  
yes  
but a not as normal button in the l. c. d. yeah  
goal is  
that um that um in a way it looks kind of awkward  
right uh anything else to say on teamwork at all  
um  
mm  
you've got dimension thirty nine times thirty nine  
sorry sorry sorry  
is  
ah  
okay  
i mean uh  
well that's what i meant is it's a bit pointless having it as file open 'cause it will be opening those files all the time  
so that's a one  
everybody's gonna like oh 'cause <unk> is the in thing nowadays  
if i had a cool new t. v. and this was <unk> looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel  
so this is basically what i <unk> had in mind in the fade proof symbols locator a sound uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols  
mm-hmm  
no that is just something that in my opinion uh with the work that's been already done is something we can get pretty quickly  
i i i think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it  
yes  
<unk>  
no  
so <unk> it's <unk> just a matter of um yeah you just <unk> basically just play it  
let's mark that then  
so therefore you would yeah yeah i mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones was to have some in blue  
okay cool  
yeah  
i think it's there but more or less it's again based on m. f. c. c. <unk> or something like that  
yeah but we got some data on people that actually are <unk> are interested in that and i don't think a scroll wheel offers new functionality  
slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do  
so which is pretty <unk> good  
is it fancy  
um uh and re i think we should start to think about evaluation by now  
yeah  
okay then teletext is used less  
huh  
um so these are the <unk> so a all the functionality of the remote control  
you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud and  
okay that's a fair evaluation  
but it's done before uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio pocket radios  
huh  
mm  
right  
yes uh  
thanks  
mm-hmm  
maybe maybe some other <unk> uh p. h. d. student should be hired to work on you know the generating gamma  
okay so we can take this into account  
but at the same time uh user friendly  
so so for the same price we have four screens now  
yeah you're like press and it's  
huh  
me too  
i think one battery is enough  
yeah  
was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible  
so do you have uh more question or uh do you have a  
more basic  
dock to put it in to to charge it  
yeah  
no objection  
you know a synthesis okay here's the basic idea behind exchange structure and  
but that's fine isn't it  
and then it comes so i it actually takes quite a long time  
'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and <unk> if it's on your phone  
that's that's probably good  
uh  
yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated  
huh  
yes  
innovative  
mm  
the sixty mil no it i it doesn't really  
so uh from my point of view i don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech high definition  
so this isn't actually um ruining your schedule for anything and that's why you're waiting  
what does um i. c. s. mean  
so um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the industrial designer  
m. b. d. a. presumably is lambda  
uh  
yeah yeah  
maybe green  
but  
yeah  
there are disadvantages an an l. c. d. display would have to be quite small  
yeah  
trend watching  
i think <unk> what's really important is it has to look good it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand  
uh i. v. c. i. v. c. should go faster  
okay  
yeah it's <unk> yeah yeah yeah  
oh well it's quite easy to <unk> shape thing like carrot isn't it  
'kay  
like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there it doesn't have to be anything fancy just a little menu showing yeah  
beep  
it's what from my experience  
but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device  
falling a little bit behind schedule  
is it sort of a <unk> product  
but presumably whatever it is they've been going through is now over  
no i don't think so  
okay  
<unk> <unk> <unk>  
here stick it on  
well that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units  
and uh with the with the with the motto we put fashion in electronics  
i think so  
but you think it should be one  
fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room  
is it plugged in well  
no we have a problem there  
it grips automatically  
but what is he uh  
and so we can go with the same thing but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique  
um so you have to work on the component uh concept  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yes but it's also a telescope and i think he if there's no other way of describing it that telescope  
oh well  
okay i i get it  
what type of battery  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
yeah but that's just more a se a seasonal a trend thing  
uh um uh what we do release a phase domain analysis  
yeah  
'cause frank did all that because he then had an experiment  
the microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button  
mm-hmm  
mm  
including all the stuff inside so it will be very cheap for us  
i've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not  
but isn't that <unk> always the case with something that's not particularly  
okay  
yep  
'kay  
for our next product our new t. v. set with uh <unk> uh sound adjustment light  
oh okay  
um right if <unk> if we're <unk> buttons we might be able to make them actually larger  
one thing i was thinking though is i dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting we talked about our favourite animals  
so <unk> <unk> because it's very annoying when your battery is empty  
now this is a layer just above it which might interest you  
yeah but he's saying if it is correct and you can draw very yeah very precise  
a minute or or ten maybe  
but  
okay  
'cause  
mm  
true  
you know what i mean like we we couldn't answer every single question  
five  
oh well for all you know that that'll happen  
so more or less if we uh can we can plot it  
yeah  
it won't uh roll around or stuff  
yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh  
yeah  
i mean the user would return the <unk> product to the company 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made  
so i think i mean really disabled people yeah might be a problem but i think it's a little take it into consideration  
and and and you run p. l. s. a. on it now that doesn't do it good and bad it does i dunno english and french pages  
user interface designer that's that's that's you so you gotta you go you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need  
i do  
it's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now  
mm  
for what  
so you could just  
so as i said the half times are in the three person offices  
but in <unk> it isn't it in latin like et cetera like et <unk> or  
no most of the the festival uh what you get on linux machines is <unk> based only  
that means it's new <unk>  
three and an half  
um  
good point  
i don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism  
uh is it a special colour  
i didn't think about that  
mm-hmm  
and uh we asked them if we had some new <unk> features  
we have the smart boards uh the <unk> those two boards  
right  
no  
emission line objects shouldn't be in either of them  
so i don't know how they do that exactly  
mm-hmm  
but it was just to it's a question  
yeah quite jealous actually  
so the of course if it's you are not a maximum you are not going i inside the window you are not the max  
um  
but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection  
um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there  
so <unk> you it's not that you all the no  
yeah  
it works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out  
again  
yeah um  
mm-hmm  
yeah maybe  
no what i maybe think is um  
okay  
oh that's that's good to know  
classic <unk> like this one or you have also some button like l. c. d. where you know  
but that's really where your field is  
yeah  
be better i think  
yeah yeah i understand yeah yeah  
it's cool  
which the problem with it is that generally you first have to get the mean and only <unk> only once you have the mean you know what  
yeah yeah  
it's you and me outside a little here  
i don't think that's very practical but but uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour  
well in fact <unk> both will be could be useful navigating through teletext  
this one crashed  
the blue blue uh  
no exactly  
mm-hmm  
we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or  
mm-hmm  
okay it's an abstract drawing  
yeah  
mm  
so but aurora is it really big database or i mean how much time it takes to set up system and then  
that's a that's a fish  
and we're a fashion forward technology company  
wait  
i'll show you  
say  
do we change the the order  
mm-hmm  
true  
as we know uh google it's a very successful because his um powerful function but with very easy to use user interface  
i don't know  
i think i think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote  
but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control i think is a big question  
look something like that  
mm-hmm  
um do we have  
and the  
so uh  
i think it's easier to draw  
so we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement l. c. d. screen  
i think we worked great as a team  
it's more like a tank  
i uh like no no no no no  
maybe  
no you cannot  
no i don't get that on my machine  
no well th  
right  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
but if you can put it in one single mega file that would be quite useful for me  
yeah i don't know  
well we will we will i think we'll work that out zapping numbers on it bi  
that's why the scroll needs to be really robust  
huh  
is uh everyone ready  
yeah  
is that okay with you  
i don't know i don't have a nokia phone but  
mm-hmm  
so i mean this is also one of the <unk> dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include  
design  
so my name's cat and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um  
no sorry i mean the um so so most the  
mm-hmm  
okay but i made three pages and they were not finished  
yeah  
so if you uh were to write them down for yourself and then put that in your computer you still have to type it over to word  
five  
i think the colour has a lot to do with it  
well the extra functions  
yes that's true  
sorry you used the <unk>  
yeah and i though <unk> we had about single colours but you can also make uh a wood colour  
and i would okay  
so um we will have to  
hmm  
i mean <unk> my view on this was that um the need for people to back up their data personally was made sufficiently clear to lab users  
'kay  
i thought the light from the inside was gonna light up  
or grandma as well you know it's like what is the mute button  
sure  
mm-hmm  
but uh  
mm no  
ten years  
what it is is um it's cones 'cause i thought they'd be more exciting  
oh i see  
okay  
okay  
well it  
well  
mm-hmm  
well yeah i mean you can put the we could i i dunno i mean i suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know  
it's clear  
ah 'kay okay that's <unk>  
intentional um in the sense that they break deliberately when they bring them into the new parts  
because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty  
oh but do we want to implement that or  
yeah at least yeah yeah yeah  
right right  
then we have one euro thirty for the whole docking station  
and uh the whole idea here is says also put the lapel on  
but uh i think it looks nice in the first time  
so  
mm  
per unit okay okay  
they want uh they want more luxury stuff but they have the money to do it and they want to <unk> to buy that  
my apologies  
definitely  
okay  
yeah yeah sure  
yeah the yeah it's definitely attractive  
mm-hmm  
oh it won't let me do that  
yeah  
text to speech  
um this one i thought was really cool  
okay  
yeah if you want  
<unk> more of a <unk> <unk> perhaps  
and then at the moment we can say okay we need someone to help us  
mm <unk> mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yep  
no requirements are changed  
then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons etcetera  
yeah but for each country you have to do one because uh the for example for se  
give it a little bit  
okay daniel  
so i mean that in itself it would i mean you'd have some fun training some more speech recognition models  
yeah  
sure  
the um  
i think that's quite useful um even without displaying them sort of dis continuously  
um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is <unk> but in the dark it sort of it's alive  
we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice <unk> yeah  
don't have a the the  
so if <unk> if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it then uh our recognition is totally gone  
three  
well this is yeah  
that's sixteen isn't it yeah  
much more than me  
so uh that's about it  
remotes which were displayed by norman they weren't fancy i mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons  
an advanced chip on print  
okay the project aim is to design a new remote control  
so it gives you a probability of a topic given a document which is z. given d. and a probability of a word given a topic  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah so  
yeah  
the <unk> yeah the frequency of the tones yeah  
right  
oh  
um  
to work on that  
and if i when i was uh listening the uh the talk of uh milan <unk> uh he's the czech guy but he lives in uh in canada  
you have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form  
yeah  
are we going to have a backup  
no it <unk> maybe it will be cheaper i dunno i just may maybe you making a <unk>  
<unk>  
do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us  
two three four  
okay  
yeah  
um okay with the interface we have the following options we can <unk> we can use push buttons  
okay  
i dunno maybe i would car  
hmm  
it's um i mean i know that <unk> times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh i should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now  
yeah yeah  
so they use some approach where they tie them automatically and uh after that well  
okay so elephant goes like this  
uh we we worked together um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work  
'cause you can do you can just measure the drift between the two of them  
i think he's talking about sort of the ones that  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yay  
okay  
so but that's also kind of cat isn't it  
oh yeah i understand  
so some the <unk> basically they only had to how the dom works um so i can do the next so i can <unk> generate d. d. f. files  
um rubber indeed  
or we just tie it to it  
or it doesn't have to be problem but one constraint is that we are processing one second of the signal  
t. v. remote controller where are you  
for example  
a green rabbit  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
really annoying  
no  
right  
yeah  
i want to uh  
um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery  
welcome to our detailed design meeting  
it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand  
but yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station  
the people want to pay for for it so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half  
okay thanks  
question number nine  
uh indeed indeed  
yeah  
so it's going to be bend a lot  
yeah  
and it's also quite easy to use so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new and it might attract older people because it's easy to use  
yeah  
it's true  
so you just say okay let's <unk> let's put the line there  
yeah  
and go for battery instead  
ooh  
it gives visual feedback  
yeah  
oh yeah  
true  
let's see let's give it a little bit of a snout i don't know some teeth  
yeah yeah  
yeah yeah <unk> yeah i i find i must trying to uh tell it  
that'd be that'd be good if we were going with our our ball  
i'm yeah  
so the button we can use plastic  
well i'll check uh with my  
indexing or annotation or whatever meta data extraction  
yeah but now you have your your like your star trek <unk> thing shaped control  
so like the interface is really important  
it's the phase no you can again put the that envelope with this phase together because envelope is <unk>  
and they have these problems solved so  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of t. v. <unk>  
yeah  
so people don't just see it and think uh this is so simplistic i don't want to spend twenty five euros  
yeah it's like a yeah  
and finally the incorporation of a l. c. d. or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting but i don't know if the budget  
experienced yeah  
yeah  
um  
okay  
mm-hmm  
i mean <unk> three quarters of the next age group twenty five to thirty five are interested  
so maybe we could start with the market yeah  
oh pardon me  
it could be a battery like rechargeable probably  
no no  
and next please  
channel up channel down volume up volume down and a numerical keypad  
it could be a beep kind of thing  
hey  
same  
well it is really  
we we really want a l. c. d. other otherwise we <unk> <unk> not get the market  
and last but not least or indeed first of all it it must make the company money  
and the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent  
um maybe then our market should be t. v. manufacturers rather than the public  
well i'm not the technical person who would do it  
but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then  
enough  
if you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know  
it's reliable  
yeah  
'kay  
okay  
so  
mm-hmm of course  
uh-huh  
what would you like to  
because yeah one thing uh maybe we will talk about that is the library uh  
because  
just something  
but for instance here it i <unk> it would be problematic to have motion  
hmm  
so <unk> we're within budget  
else it <unk> won't sell  
expensive  
mm  
i can say it to you without  
mm-hmm  
sorry  
<unk> like yeah  
but then you can learn to use your right <unk> like i was just thinking if there's left handers and right handers in the family what they have two remotes  
that's a brilliant idea  
um unless an a i mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l. c. d. display where would we put that  
okay  
yeah  
i will try my best yeah  
okay  
one back  
or  
and then it has  
but to use those we'd have to use more chips um and that would cost us more  
mm  
hope you have good lunch  
mm  
we don't really know what the difference  
like uh something to to like <unk> i think phones  
no  
oh that's just yeah  
mm-hmm  
and i think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic and maybe some more <unk> brighter and flashy stuff  
no but it's  
um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore  
yeah  
yeah i'd i'd give it a one  
<unk> what what is special <unk> oh yeah special form  
oh  
so extra <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
well i think <unk> what it would be is like like the <unk> like this where it's maybe you know a digital  
if she just sends one round around to everyone then only the psycho linguists will say what was for me  
yeah  
yeah  
we're there  
so  
good job you guys  
quite big  
so the beginning and the end it it i it's not crappy  
ah  
normally have a car yeah so  
bigger and the base  
oh we've been writing this up for <unk> months  
everything is you say in every t. v. that's configured under the menu  
so the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button you know like on and off  
first the opening then the rest  
on the front of course because else you can't find it  
yeah  
not more than two colours i think  
look into  
so how much work is there left and when do we actually need it by would be useful to discuss  
when it yeah <unk> when it's died is a problem  
yeah i think i think they're right yeah  
or  
so  
okay  
okay  
so it's <unk> if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button then maybe they could be a different shape  
but that's not uh very <unk>  
tasks  
that is false  
yeah  
<unk> oh <unk> what i've what i've seen just not related to this but of latex cases before  
yeah just uh the numbers  
it's a way for you to uh  
i like the covers  
i don't know  
so  
yeah  
yes  
mm-hmm  
seven  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
hello  
'cause uh <unk> if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext  
just knowing that <unk> initiation in introduces a new discourse goal and a response um meets or negates that goal in some way  
uh i wouldn't like to be 'cause i'd like to go to the gym  
so so the utterances are tied to topic segments  
you had to get used to the system not the system to you  
<unk> volume yes um th <unk> we need to <unk> identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance  
we  
yeah yeah yeah  
are we ready for our last presentation amber  
okay  
i think it's um fashion into electronics  
yeah  
is it depending on television  
okay  
but uh i've i've seen quite a few papers i i've <unk> not done it myself  
'kay  
and the lighting adaptation and the teletext  
you want the l. c. d. display  
yeah  
alright  
yeah but we haven't  
we split um we split the signal in small frames like sixteen millisecond  
we maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be but  
but not for this kind of market and not for this kind of price  
so uh my one it uh should be in the shared folder  
yeah i think so  
yeah but how many buttons do we need  
mm-hmm  
so  
uh  
whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all you know  
i i'm not really sure how this works but  
and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end  
something  
at o. p. f. l. uh the learning centre will be built in a couple of uh years  
yeah interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that <unk> as you point out  
<unk> to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and i show you the the working design  
yeah right for the uh initiative uh launch  
eh chips  
hmm  
mm  
okay we'll see after  
mm  
yeah  
yeah we're done here  
because one of the <unk> thing is to work one week then one month no et cetera  
yeah  
yeah  
microphone yeah  
yeah  
concerning a uh conceptual design  
are the costs within the budget  
yeah it should be after every um acronym letter  
yeah  
and you the you <unk> you turn off the t. v.  
mm no  
but it seems to me sensible 'cause as you rightly said there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room  
you have a presentation  
and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and <unk>  
yeah yeah  
also  
mm  
options  
so this not very important  
yeah yeah  
but maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this so i can try to include it in the final report  
after  
yes uh  
you know if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just <unk> aren't feasible  
hmm  
uh-huh  
it's a dog in a village  
yeah  
exactly the same yeah  
eight yeah uh i get down now to one two degrees uh root mean square error  
<unk> that would indirectly also drop stuff  
yeah that's a cool idea  
sorry guys  
uh i think so just  
before come up with the scheme you mean  
well it can be  
i must finish off now so it's over  
but i mean if we're like so mean we were gonna do this thing for um i can't even remember was it two or three days  
well uh some research has be done uh has been done  
um i'm from india  
no the interesting thing is the sound came when i tried it last time after i i triggered off something by clicking on something  
uh well i think it's obvious right now  
so  
yeah sure  
mine  
but that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand you know double curved wooden remotes  
yeah  
uh words in the posterior estimation so the main motivation is to see if we can integrate this kind of extra knowledge in the posterior estimation  
so a l. d. a. you basically draw a a <unk> which says like what type of document this is effectively  
so if no go ahead  
hey just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the <unk> of that uh  
that's that is where it breaks  
but that we can decide about but a general sort of  
but i think our our next step to look at is just that  
it doesn't always work  
oh interface concept  
exactly  
most people yeah  
hit f. eight again  
then what did they estimate of that  
hmm  
uh al al i uh  
hmm  
yeah it did <unk> it did <unk> just now  
<unk>  
we we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um  
great thank you for your time  
you'd you know you're in the dark you don't wanna be looking at the remote control  
i think in this case um i <unk> i would say this is probably an entity  
i haven't gotten an agenda yet um i'll put that together  
well we're gonna go with i think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so  
i find them they can be a bit annoying especially  
and  
so you can you can hold it really comfortable that's basically the idea  
you have a lot of options  
and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and  
so um you could go for plastic but i figured  
a strawberry  
yeah yeah  
let's call it th  
'cause triple a. <unk> we're gonna have <unk> do more than one battery  
um  
we <unk> we don't know whether  
we never were pushed for time or sat around doing nothing so  
yeah so it's  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah probably  
yeah you're just the user interface hmm  
uh that it can vary a bit depending on the calibration  
yeah it's hidden in there somewhere  
or use uh a <unk> uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch  
well all of the time for a few functions  
um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about  
but uh the this image shows the results using motion when you <unk> use the motion features and here on the right is when using the histogram uh distance  
oh unfortunately i don't have costing information  
could we get something that  
maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh  
yeah  
that's great  
yeah  
'kay  
huh  
um th th the double risk  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
you could call to your uh yeah and the screen yeah  
rubber  
'kay  
yeah  
i didn't  
yes  
and uh  
well it depends though well it depends  
i only have  
yeah mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control  
it's perfect  
okay  
mm-hmm  
right  
'cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special so so no matter how you look at that that would be the same  
yeah yeah yeah  
so  
yeah even if somebody says just yes  
of the  
looks kinda like like it has holly growing out of its head  
mm-hmm  
industry designer  
yeah  
do it again  
i see  
you should feed that uh that animal  
okay  
'kay  
uh the fourth one  
uh  
okay  
and okay should never be um two capital letters it should be o. k. a. y.  
volume  
okay  
if we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the t. v. or we have control over the t. v. then we can't actually display that  
not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys you know  
yeah  
or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel so we would need the numbers  
or are we planning to construct our own circuit board  
oh sorry  
cool  
it's not coming  
much more constructive  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah  
and um well my conclusion is uh is uh less is more keep it simple  
okay  
it's very curvy so okay  
'cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change  
okay so two  
um  
i do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now  
so  
'cause you yeah  
okay understand  
he's the master yeah  
um yeah that's it for now  
let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about <unk> uh <unk> <unk> <unk> getting into  
five  
and i'm okay  
yeah  
um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables  
if it was um  
um  
i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me  
well certainly  
or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing  
mm  
th this under it  
yeah but they give you also training data or only the testing data  
be interesting  
quite <unk> yeah  
yes  
colour and slogan um which i think is more in the user uh range with steph  
mm-hmm  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
it should be the galaxy yeah  
two  
mm-hmm  
uh 'cause i had to choose a value  
it should be able to mm-hmm  
i have a shorter report for you today  
okay  
mm 'kay  
so  
yeah but  
makes it easy to use  
mm-hmm  
okay my personal preferences  
um no i wouldn't because it's they're physical things not <unk> features  
let's see you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel so it <unk> your favourite channel  
you're doing it time based at the moment  
it's the  
okay so you attended mostly posters i guess  
yeah maybe in the full page because i i spent lots of time doing this presentation so  
hmm  
just follow that link  
could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something  
one light here  
uh i do agree because well it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button  
yeah as soon as i've finished all the meetings i think there's not that much to do unless i get some evaluation method  
what do you mean  
case material we said rubber  
ah now it's <unk> fifty million euros we've gotta uh we've <unk> gotta make profit so we're making that at twelve and a half euros a time  
and they don't know what to do with the h. t. m. l. goo  
i have think maybe it's integrated with the l. c. display  
yeah  
like here  
yeah  
yeah  
so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other  
it's um  
i have to i want to check it i can show it you afterwards  
well i wouldn't th i mean my reaction to an all yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror so i think just having it  
okay  
distance  
'kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface  
and i mean if you if you know how to do it for individual words then you can just in the worst case  
five  
because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of  
okay  
so if anyone of us gets it we can then just use an <unk> hmm  
yes two but only in <unk> when you compare it with with elderly  
me first again or yeah  
like you know what i mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your t. v.  
it's an ergonomic shape so it it fits in your hand nicely  
okay yeah  
yeah  
yeah difficult english word  
yeah no th the <unk> cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know  
uh the different <unk> presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the  
yep  
i mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb  
mm  
yeah okay  
right so uh the the push buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry  
yeah  
that's  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> been worse  
because that's not possible uh  
channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour  
huh  
do you think it's an option  
okay so if it <unk> uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device  
on the  
okay  
oh if if we have l. c. d. displays that opens up a whole world you know  
mm-hmm  
so of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver  
yep  
um let's go for the three presentations so first um marketing expert  
psychology people probably that's i reckon it's the best thing to do  
that's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more  
fair enough  
oh yeah  
well hard it's not for the for the <unk> for the elderly  
oh  
you if if we change our mind later when we go through we can always come back to it and say  
uh i don't think it's a very special colour  
oh uh yes  
yes i  
yeah  
about the number  
it's just the same  
um room for creativity  
uh  
yeah i'm i'm somewhere but maybe you can help me  
i think it's it makes it both easy and both <unk> innovative  
it's uh  
i'm fine  
does anyone know anything about which dice machines have sound cards and how to find them  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
the power button could be like a big apple or something  
yeah  
right okay  
yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals  
well cheap meeting room is the you know mm it's a conference room  
but i don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that so i think you have to  
it's it's natural  
okay  
so um  
whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five euros for this kind of device is <unk> is well is not sure  
you press audio on the <unk> and you get the buttons for audio settings so the other buttons are gone  
no no  
all the interest in features not really the l. c. oh here  
okay  
network places  
and also the company want to keep it stuck to the t. v. for uh to keep down the production time  
i presume  
remote control itself  
ah  
mm  
for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the  
this correlation studies  
will you look  
and the device has to <unk> you know based on you push button a. so i will do something with button a.  
yeah but then you can use a a front  
well  
we have our up and down buttons which are also gonna be our channel <unk> and we have our little menu button here  
okay  
yeah  
i think that should be possible  
or  
oh overall i mean i thought we did a good job like  
first we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control  
okay  
when we can expect to see  
oh yeah  
huh  
true  
uh mm mm  
yeah  
which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size and the t. f. t. which is seven inches  
but at least you <unk>  
hi oh okay  
go for it  
upgrade  
the softer the better  
yeah yeah yeah  
uh you're four i think  
and it's it's a bit more sophisticated than that but then de facto it just ends up doing that mostly from what i figured out  
and it was my thesis even  
'kay  
yes yes i have that too  
mm-hmm  
mm mm  
and um it's very easy for a user to to switch <unk> yes  
uh they'll be rubber yep  
i <unk>  
but you know th they weren't concentrating  
source types  
yeah alright  
well we definitely need those  
so we could not put that  
i dunno if i can  
so in po uh so no sonic points  
not much  
uh can i just get some things clear just for my sake  
that was our target  
closing  
okay so we want something that looks good  
yes  
a and in the same lines we would have a one more problem  
yeah  
no it does not it does not if <unk> i changed it  
were we  
okay  
that's more useful  
we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand by signal  
okay  
i'm  
rather than the l. c. d. whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
crazy  
yeah some  
the full page presentation yep  
um  
if they do  
yeah  
right  
uh well well a bit so four  
so we can infer that if a sound is coming in this area it's the same  
hmm  
you just want to hide them all  
so you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control  
it could be good in the display to annotate them in the display if we can  
what about <unk> how do you feel about putting her in a separate office  
how many people how many people actually use every feature that <unk> you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that  
if you start getting into kinda <unk> and things it gets a bit weird  
so do <unk> uh make it a special colour then  
um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance  
yeah that's a good point  
i th i think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple t. v. <unk> yeah 'cause it's selling on its own  
that's it stand  
anyway  
copy  
yeah  
yeah  
might be a  
yeah right exactly  
no it's if you press twice on the plus button then you get <unk> <unk>  
yeah  
no  
so i put it in the blue bag  
uh  
is it to scale or do you think you can make it a bit smaller  
good question  
i guess that's what you mean by precision right  
it's easier  
mm yeah  
you don't have presentation  
<unk>  
no i just swapped it with uh mike <unk> i think 'cause <unk> he is not going to be here this time  
yeah i like that one but that one is terrible  
mm  
maybe maybe i should uh start  
oh  
uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this right  
aye a fair point definitely  
okay  
so as you know you i think you already know me sammy <unk>  
so we are all already nineteen  
mm-hmm  
is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control but  
um there are also motions being recorded of objects  
so  
that's true  
it's inside  
mm-hmm  
yeah but then that means that the girls can't test it  
mm-hmm  
i have another meeting so if you could uh  
use  
mm-hmm  
uh  
mm  
i it's too late in terms of research uh mm  
so and the other thing is um when we get some calls say we have  
yeah  
yeah  
yes because i don't know  
em  
mm  
right  
i'm afraid i incorporated that when i said who was present but yes we did  
we will uh meet again for the next meeting and uh in this one want to  
so is that fixable  
or are we just going to go with one  
it's all we need  
mm-hmm  
uh well  
no  
uh  
in between  
i've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate  
okay so we have to deal with <unk> what's possible here  
yeah i thin i mean it wouldn't be difficult to um create a file of the <unk> <unk> of that shape  
maybe it would be better to have just a dedicated machine just for that  
um this would be valid for uh like speech recognition with a single channel  
yes  
um which is the next section  
so  
celebration  
maybe just one button say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah you were the project project manager and uh had the final vote  
maybe we can use it for our party  
yeah mobile phones  
yeah but uh is uh english  
mm-hmm  
being watched  
meeting action  
does it not  
afternoon guys  
yeah <unk> <unk> no we just want it to be a finder  
so this was the my personal preference was that we can have a. s. r. sitting there on the remote control  
so um just they in th um in the speech uh re synthesis or coding what you're doing um did you try to to play with the knobs somewhere  
and yeah that you can choose what the design displays or <unk> whatever  
so i think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world so to speak  
it's fairly general um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking like um voice recognition  
i mean maybe you guys would just wanna ask him directly you're done done right  
the most standard batteries  
but teletext is just one button  
they are not so good looking  
potato mango shaped remotes  
ah uh well whatever  
well  
we should have confidence in technology  
well the other option of course is that um the well i was going to say clapping um  
then we have uh technology  
exactly  
um  
he's got plenty of toys  
um  
in a sense it's in a it's it's basically just to to a high degree really telling you how <unk> how rare a word is or how common a word is  
yeah  
and you only use the hyphen i think when the sentence is definitely not continuing anywhere  
okay we're uh on target  
yeah for the interface something added value  
yes i agree too  
mm-hmm  
good  
absolutely  
yeah  
but uh in these two strands or work they uh just come up with a list maybe not uh exhaustive  
and then use the  
non technically challenged people are gonna use it  
they don't actually say how often do those happen  
okay  
but just comparing this one with the  
um just to go back most people are grouped in projects  
it doesn't really make sense to call it file open or anything like that 'cause that's it's more like an option  
alright we yeah  
yeah it's it's it's not a phase  
let's say amplitude modulation when you have <unk> just the carrier and that modulation signal right  
you've got  
like sort of having all fruit shaped keys that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly  
selection button for various entertainment devices so you want something that will permit you to select the d. v. d. player or the t. v. or the stereo system  
in the basement  
uh-huh  
so but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay we only we we win one  
thanks  
just it'll just work hopefully  
you know things might be more advanced than that  
okay so we are over budget  
yeah i didn't really consider doing it on perplexity actually that to be hon but okay  
and uh  
so that's gonna be you catherine if we wanna hear from you first  
because yeah it's much quicker if we're both working separately i think  
or you know  
could be yeah  
red  
mm yeah  
okay  
um multifunctional controls can be difficult to use as the multitude of buttons can be confusing  
i've just filled uh  
if you're picking out a line  
it should stay  
caramel  
yeah  
however i did not pursue this idea the following year because the comments i received from students in two thousand were generally discouraging  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
we can try  
just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like  
i like the shape of this one  
is that possible  
source filter type approaches or or whatever yeah  
and i think it's more robust  
i agree  
to produce it yeah  
well once we've got them identified a lot of them were the same problem going round and round  
can we then not also uh change the material  
okay  
no no  
no  
sixty  
and it should be easy to use  
or open  
so today we are going to have a <unk> second meeting  
special requirements  
mm  
so he gave me scale <unk> of <unk>  
hmm  
well not hidden but they're uh  
right and then you're dealing with ports and cords and  
uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse friendly components  
yep  
but uh they spend their money more easily  
yeah  
um  
yeah okay but does it that is for uh going from four to five  
spongy  
just a suggestion  
i think that most people like it now that it's there  
um  
otherwise we have two results in one question  
so you were talking about uh um we're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel the hidden away panel would all be standard  
for each person yeah  
so now the recent investigation we we have done <unk> of the remote control um  
so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points  
so i had to uh i dunno make an overview for myself about what i have to do  
well we have both head set and lapel transcription  
alright  
uh so as you said uh remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room  
what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like etcetera so  
and i think what i said everybody has them uh has them already  
alright  
the colour and the screen  
well well um  
but that i'm i think after the meeting we can go and talk to olivier about that  
i don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger ami or something  
and it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable  
okay  
that's me  
on on which project  
the um  
the simple one being better for a user the complex better for an engineer  
and you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options  
mm-hmm  
yeah it can break down  
it becomes a very dull remote control i know  
the fruity thing is just the shape should be <unk> i did i think this is kind of fruity you know  
um it's not hand dynamo it's powered by battery so we give it a  
the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message which it then  
yeah  
um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is  
<unk>  
yep  
so red buttons are okay  
no  
so you on my one at home i've got a v. c. r. remote which then changes the channel on the v. c. r. and doesn't do anything on the t. v.  
i think  
it can really combat its enemies even like it it's a it's an <unk> but uh it can really defend itself  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us  
but i mean coding is a much more sort of it's it's it well i mean it's it's uh it when it boils down to just mathematics to a large extent  
mm-hmm  
uh can i draw here or uh  
every remote control looks the same so uh in my opinion it should be um user friendly and unique  
well  
what about the user interface there are also some some questions uh about the concepts i think you have some ideas on that  
advanced like three eight six advance  
no  
okay that is cool  
and then like a jo  
yeah yeah probably  
i thought we okay so uh that wraps it up  
so you have to keep in mind that not all uh <unk> not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions  
here you go  
yeah  
but you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh  
but it's fifty percent of the mark  
may not be th as functional  
even bigger than for l. c. d.  
um  
we agree i guess on uh several thing on most uh on things  
mm-hmm  
oh no it should  
'cause we have got room we've got some budget there to add a few things to it that's right  
um all right  
yes  
if you can uh flip  
an idea  
uh  
yeah and then <unk>  
and you two uh are going to do this  
yeah  
so so it's it's not that i'm criticizing the product at all  
and i saw uh a bunch of stuff about software updates  
at the same time it is <unk> more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r. s. i. and all problem  
it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've <unk> you've got the five standard  
yeah you're di dismissed  
mm  
remote  
time yeah  
but to the <unk> degree that a group is building an argument together  
micro <unk>  
we decided that <unk> certain points that will make our product unique  
i dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the t. v. or maybe that's <unk> it would have to incorporate  
yeah  
yeah  
so what about a general layout like this that we have here  
and if you smooth it doing a smooth spectrum representation of the harmonic <unk>  
uh  
okay  
different truly different then the <unk> remote control <unk> would be it  
and here  
no  
so that we can reach the energy out of it out of that  
yeah  
<unk> yeah look uh not very much detail yeah  
that's somewhere in the sound card  
this is just there is <unk>  
okay  
it's it it will be take care of our main mm  
and um yeah  
don't look at it please  
let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that  
yeah  
i used to eat it  
uh  
uh maybe you have read uh read the website  
mm-hmm  
i can change the script  
high tech  
okay  
very important  
yeah so you have the thumb kind of here  
i'm just too lazy to draw it all black so  
yeah that should be possible too  
uh that is not the question  
okay  
okay i should i think i <unk> i still have the the total report to finish up  
mister ed  
why should that not be possible  
mm-hmm  
mm  
no you can <unk> push zero  
so we just put something i think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually  
yeah i suppose  
larger  
yeah yeah  
it is beautiful and it's everything that we discussed  
i will look it up  
but we want it to be seen  
<unk> because uh after talking to jane um just uh we have different ideas whether uh meeting action will be about the same size as topic segments  
very expensive no  
mm-hmm  
well i i don't know how we're gonna do the fusing of the different if <unk> importance measures anyway  
'kay  
think i can uh what this just an example  
it might be good to know um uh who you know who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh <unk>  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
okay right  
but you got some extra information uh  
yeah  
well that has another element which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger then you then it has a place  
we'll just send all of our manufacturing to  
rough  
you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that  
i i hope uh that uh if it's a big success uh they will ask <unk> to to provide something like this of course with some money or at least to pay a student or somebody for doing it  
no i'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this  
okay  
okay  
you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on  
okay uh another <unk> some stuff about the the the design of the docking station  
that's that's that's back  
sarah but um doing my presentation in the order i wrote it  
um well i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels  
mm  
mm  
oh that's very good of you  
okay  
which i will show you  
so i think it should be a package in that case  
okay  
we can play with the slide  
that's that's probably fine  
and this is important and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high tech uh devices a chip of <unk> <unk> to them and connect them  
yeah  
um you have to test basically  
great  
i mean seeing that it's over broad band it's forwarding the graphics quite okay it would probably like broad band wise band width wise probably work out  
okay  
safe  
yes yep  
but it's uh  
it it's just the daylight you know  
yep  
if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or <unk> at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low  
you know  
no my laptop  
and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use  
mm  
okay  
um and i wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between  
so i don't know how long we have left of our uh time  
here i am  
you mean different colours for the lighting or  
well no  
too much text and it gets too too busy  
maybe if it's possible it's not too expensive i think a joystick is better  
uh this is for children but th  
yeah  
i think so too  
oh i had to delete this but i had to make a schematic uh of the of the new but i had too too little time  
and what else was i thinking of that i haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head <unk>  
oh you know  
and then at the end just take an average  
so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control  
yeah  
again  
um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are like they can reflect different colours  
right  
yeah i <unk> used i <unk> i should use that one but it doesn't  
yeah  
it's that mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the <unk> the slogan of the company  
all in a single button  
right away i'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here thinking  
yeah they have thick fingers  
yeah  
yep  
yeah they're willing they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality  
so we should look  
okay so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated  
yeah yeah  
no i i agree with you  
i mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer <unk> which um i mean <unk> you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and <unk> you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable  
mm-hmm  
and the chip uh sends it to the led and the led sends it to the receiver  
so um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way  
that's reasonable  
um  
well you can say that this one is for let's say <unk> or interns  
thank you  
yeah  
they don't sell green rubber plants  
just just write your name in in one line  
so what's basically <unk> the <unk> idea sorry now  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year we can have the face plates yeah  
yeah that <unk> yeah but yeah the pro no well i think that it might be <unk> <unk> well nee but we don't yeah  
okay  
unique yeah  
does it need internet or or do do we stay at  
so for instance if someone is talking uh we can just have a light that will centre on the point that is uh close to him  
oh yeah uh i have to say something  
i <unk> i suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be <unk> some kind of symbol  
alright and each button <unk>  
'cause you know what they're gonna do with it  
as long as as long as they've got an i. d. in there we can just say right at this <unk> between these times they're looking at that object or they're looking at the mouse  
yeah as a button though  
but <unk> th our basic idea <unk> i mean you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials  
uh well we have to put that in  
yeah  
but i mean if if the two of us are just working on it it doesn't make a difference 'cause i've already mounted your directory now  
um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition we'd have to probably get an advanced one  
okay go on  
and the reason she gave me was something to do with uh taking out like a whole day or a whole afternoon would be quite difficult  
so <unk> you know i if we keep it simpler like that so that it's in little pieces  
something some the menu button i don't know but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get  
a big office  
okay  
the process i mean the interaction between us became better and better i guess  
okay  
use friendly  
pointless  
get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v. c. r. and get it to play once it's <unk> for instance  
so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now  
mm hard to know what where your role ends yeah  
yeah  
you're right yeah  
but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually  
it's like  
um i dunno what do people think about this kinetic battery idea  
they will just i it the system the the whole thing starts like this that you have to give your credit card number and sign a form and then only they will start touching your hard disk  
yeah okay but only for the basic <unk> if you're going to use the advanced option you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah  
it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make  
so  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
hmm  
oh look it here  
yellow  
i mean <unk> <unk> do they i mean what what what sort of uh  
i dunno  
hmm  
yeah which was the intuitive feeling  
should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it  
yeah  
i didn't even do that one on purpose either damn  
that was a big requirement of the old people  
mm-hmm  
so the utterances with the highest like mean information density  
an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money  
yeah  
you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive  
yeah  
uh yeah segments slash utterances already  
yeah yeah  
you can't really see it in the interface  
you would get a pencil  
okay okay  
when you click on something  
yeah  
yeah  
ten each  
or uh something like that  
yeah  
um there's an example i'll show you at the end um <unk> show you now  
yep  
it's the requirements of the user uh i guess  
but it but it's not necessary <unk>  
maybe if if you're not using the eraser  
so you know you just sort of have your hand  
hmm yeah  
mm-hmm  
i have some code for system calls like that handles the in and the output if you need some of that  
yeah it's a t. v. remote control  
just yeah  
uh keys like that  
yeah  
okay  
but a and the first two meetings i brought it with me but i didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting  
'cause twenty five euros for a remote how much is that lo locally in pounds  
okay  
yeah you can play with it  
i thought there was some flexibility with that  
so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed  
i have no absolute numbers  
so if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use  
yeah i think just the simplicity of it and  
mm  
i need we we need a like homing device  
one without l. c. d.  
a bit hot still but the bea the beach nearby is quite nice yeah  
okay  
okay  
i think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well  
<unk> first  
so um uh i don't think there is any kind of principle classification of exchanges  
yep  
um  
mm yeah  
uh again i have uh put up the specification properties  
mm-hmm  
okay  
keep the other buttons but hide them away  
mm  
so we are showing our preference for particular fruits two or three kinds rather and yeah  
and that's because  
that just you can throw all your other remotes away  
like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea i guess but <unk>  
in terms of making it work or the cost of that or  
mm  
yeah it's not a real uh <unk> usage  
wrong keyboard  
well i i did notice looking at i mean  
right  
<unk> yes that's right  
yeah  
so  
um follow on with helen  
exactly  
so we've got um detail design meeting  
but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your t. v.  
yes it's not um every important feature for now but  
maybe if we're gonna run out of time  
sorry  
yeah  
huh  
do you all get what we're doing  
that's all one big <unk> feature  
that's not so difficult at all because i already use on several voice operated systems and they are all possible to uh not all but  
if it has o. c. r. uh i think uh i would use but uh i i just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it  
um okay in the fashion how it's supposed to look  
okay  
yeah  
and i think what tends to happen is that um if people challenge the the facts  
so other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer but um obviously obviously it would  
yeah yeah  
finish tonight  
great leadership  
so  
or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range  
okay  
uh no this our only two slides  
you mean ye  
ninety degrees  
but unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month  
yeah but that's <unk> that's uh  
it can without any it's a very simple thing um which which you can vouch  
dot a. v. i. you just because we need the a. v. i. so that we can uh  
you just make the layout  
okay  
no no no part of that yeah  
i can read in the different um importance measures and then re re calculate the numbers  
i think maybe in c. d. m. a. it may be <unk> c. d. m. a. is more like  
just press the arrow keys i think  
well this is what we need to find out  
again  
there's no  
what what's  
<unk> uh i guess so  
or i think some maybe we should no that will be too costly  
uh do they want all those functions on that small  
well what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more <unk> a better idea after that  
ah there it is  
yeah  
that's me  
well actually i guess if you put s. s. h. and you know <unk> you can give a command outright after with s. s. h.  
no worries  
th then you have a ugly stupid <unk> ugly looking dumb remote that that no one would buy  
yeah it is yeah  
oh  
in that case the only words that really are important are those words that appear on both slides  
to a. v. uh to a. v. a. v. a. v.  
as wide as possible  
yeah  
these are <unk> yeah  
we ca we uh we can at least tell them that  
um and the kinetic one i guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick i think  
yeah  
but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote  
mm-hmm  
for men  
okay  
but there's no sort of system that's really built to <unk> to be able to say when you're you're capturing that  
yeah  
okay  
yeah so so but still so in in general we're having we're having utterances  
i always chuck my uh remote control around so  
and also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and  
i think it's also something that they they said the numbers in order right  
uh uh um  
yeah  
i'll wait  
okay  
if you don't have the money you can't make it  
it's a rabbit  
huh  
six  
but if you want to do with uh <unk> like certain something with the speed and all those things together then it's a different scenario  
but you know how much <unk> it was compressed  
like if you're doing it on on the word basis here with those words that in the end you then tie it back in into the right segment here  
and also like yeah  
number two  
well it can't talk anymore  
yeah sure but i could then if i if i have um the value for a segment i would perhaps just give all the  
right  
mm  
i can hope it already if they could  
yeah i think colin dave and me will actually work on on the java stuff  
but  
yeah  
uh sorry i have  
so first one it's a google controller  
the fruity colours and the autumn colours like red and brown dark red and brown  
um i end up with the same  
so not only is there a pressure to have uh  
okay so  
yeah  
yeah it says also yeah  
special colours isn't it  
we can do that  
yeah  
then we could possibly have the scroll and the push but no l. c. d. 'cause we probably can't afford that one  
for the price it's gonna be what we can afford  
okay  
'cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' t. v. <unk>  
so again you know what a frame rate kind kind of coding is <unk> it can again be seen as a track  
well um we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um  
one is a communication  
right  
i don't know  
useful  
this just of the bus  
l. s. d. is something else and it's quite nice as well  
yeah  
yeah  
so is she getting uh uh another position there  
uh that's uh that's that is one of the reason for example why which uh mark we point pretty much on slides as a mean of indexing  
capital  
and  
um yeah and i do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal  
it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something  
you think no my presentation isn't ready  
no no  
so  
it's reasonable i think yeah  
and in our case we are using a um a wheel control  
yeah  
i i i'm sorry i've lost my um  
like like mobiles yeah  
but then it's not easy to use scroll uh  
screen  
here and uh <unk> this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say <unk> you press it  
mm  
okay  
two  
so like three to five centimetres i dunno exactly but  
yeah  
in a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
he use the <unk> m. l. p. and get uh  
one to zero the two digit  
okay  
not a collection of little uh things completely unrelated  
ah  
i've seen some remote controls that are big they have a lot of buttons  
now it's looks us useful  
if you have a galaxy spectrum though you can say there's the blue component there's the red component to the spectrum  
yeah  
we just <unk> discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget  
okay  
'cause  
yeah  
or  
so we could so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things with that as well  
that thinks over a morse code that's how you should see it  
so  
yeah  
well we have it banana shaped already kind of  
<unk> difference between lines and text and the pen  
so it's <unk> tricky  
okay  
okay  
<unk> yeah yeah  
i it doesn't say anything  
so  
<unk> okay  
but now what i <unk> really trying to do is somehow approximate that uh carrier signal to do something with the carrier  
mm-hmm  
it's uh it's really stupid  
yeah  
right  
and how is it manufactured <unk> what is the process just to explain you  
see  
right  
i don't know like it's like you you've got some mobile phone  
i think it's a feature  
uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other  
the <unk> definitely be more expensive  
even if we can do it i think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment  
alright  
i've got to get <unk> working um as a sort of little multi media thing to generate a video of how to mi sort of a an instructional video  
and uh there was another section on our on the report for uh l. c. d. displays but the data wasn't there so  
mm  
i would buy  
fab  
yeah  
volume and programme yeah  
as long as we sell it with it  
so with the switch one single switch  
okay so  
mm-hmm  
well uh uh yes yes <unk> <unk> a button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers  
burritos  
anyways  
and that is it  
no okay so  
but now  
yeah  
we go  
so you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels  
i'll probably look at it  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
i don't think when you have a remote control do you change the cover  
control remotely  
so without direct show you mean the frame grabbing signal and time alignment  
this is much easier  
yeah  
no that's a good idea  
they use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
the fruit design um  
it take less time for user to learn how to use it  
but it's mostly like this is uh <unk> <unk> and these thing  
where would you physically position the buttons  
well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things  
or <unk> yeah  
the surf uh design  
sure  
okay  
and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes  
mm very nice  
a separate source class  
you know existing examples and what reactions to them have been and that sort of thing  
like for <unk> say we wanted a hundred utterances in the summary just look at the meeting take the top one hundred utterances in each other meeting  
this is not mine  
fine  
ah yeah  
so uh but we don't want to start with too many parameters  
that might be a better idea this time  
is one thing that we're going to be doing today um um as well as planning the project how we're going to  
okay  
yeah yeah  
marketing expert  
yeah that's right  
bi um yeah with some some measure of the so we could work out the number of <unk> that made and the average fixation duration as well  
yes  
yep  
yeah  
well good luck solving your problem  
uh  
yeah  
so this one's first  
hmm yes  
yeah  
so welcome back  
so maybe we can um  
yeah  
okay  
mm  
and then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case  
no it's finished yeah  
right sorry  
uh don't you think  
so is that it  
yes  
yeah i like also this one  
and <unk>  
on the other one  
yeah  
uh those voices they're not yet released  
mm  
okay  
so  
to make presentation about  
pretty difficult  
yeah  
think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery really  
yeah  
yeah  
three six seven  
although h. beta emission is a process  
okay  
volume  
but i have new um new i inputs for about that topics  
is quickly find that uh  
so to sort of <unk> bring together two things sort of design goals and also the market research that we had uh when we rate this  
if it's like you have a big uh  
mm  
mm  
you were saying that the kinetic would be useful  
mm-hmm hmm  
that's a that's a better idea  
yeah but probably we were the <unk> you know the post uh the the thing is somewhere projector  
the sample speaker the <unk> sensor  
there is not that much constraints  
would that be a just better use of our time in get  
okay  
the second one  
how exactly does it work in the technical sense  
th this information exists  
yeah  
i i have no idea whether they have idiosyncratic s. v. g. output or whether but um their track their track record could uh on some of the other standards has not there have been slightly strange things about it  
two <unk> two <unk> two yeah  
<unk>  
uh that's quite a big amount of money  
so you so so from this so you take any distribution comparison things  
i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the <unk> the name of a channel like b. b. c.  
yes i think you're right  
oh yeah <unk> she 'cause she her stuff is getting blocked off the mailing list 'cause she's not mailing from her normal account  
i'll check it for you  
yeah  
i think it was great yeah  
i mean the bus writing i mean the speed of uh the bus  
profiles  
that's how it works  
uh so that's the simple  
in project  
okay  
we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the  
yeah  
yeah it's okay  
yeah but i mean if you press it'll go to that channel right away  
uh i copied that one  
yeah  
i'm guessing a horse  
um and uh let's see well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available  
<unk> did you send us an email about this  
just not like all the other ones with uh this thing and uh here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow here an arrow  
uh <unk> you can use this information to compare to to to the frames here  
okay so the buttons should be  
so has to be yellow  
but i mean i  
it has the same exact functionality as two buttons  
yeah that's exactly the same as  
twenty five euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price  
um well i was gonna go to the gym at about three  
huh  
yes see  
yes  
yeah  
so  
uh-huh  
yeah  
as against a watch which constantly keeps moving this this thing will have to be tapped every time which which might be very frustrating for the user  
um can we go back to i'm gonna look really quickly back at those  
so i suggest i couldn't uh i had a small uh mock up uh sign on the on paper  
<unk> we'll want a product evaluation  
um so that's a bit of competition there  
um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products  
'cause uh there's a joint action  
uh the satisfaction on how things went  
i wouldn't put it in an optional device  
um i'll be doing some trend watching in the conceptual design and product evaluation for the design phase  
mm  
okay we start waiting for people coming late and uh i can say this because in this moment you cannot answer because you don't have the microphone  
now you you must push a little while  
we have the fruit we have the colours  
want this straight or what  
mm-hmm  
and yes any <unk>  
well in this case control <unk> the the television i think  
yeah way too high  
and also the the older people will like it because of that  
yeah but i'm using that for different different reason right  
i it's a bit stupid  
um it's just sometimes uh academic staff have a bit of a chip about um research staff  
so possibly  
agreed  
yeah  
next one  
yeah  
yeah  
this is good idea  
so get coding  
and then you can <unk> programme the channels the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator  
yeah  
i think we are easier if we if it's sitting on the x. m. l. than if it's sitting on the s. q. l. stuff because if it's sitting on the x. m. l.  
just to hold it  
knowledge it would need  
hmm  
but the cheaper the <unk> uh the the chip or th what was it  
because what i do is um having um values for each segment at the moment  
mm  
cut things out  
but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb if you hold the machine  
mm no  
right  
and uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface  
yeah  
the i'm not sure um  
yeah  
okay  
guess it depends how far you can stretch  
yeah  
well i'm i am  
yeah  
anyone have any questions  
welcome everyone  
continuum flux or continuum  
uh i will put my minutes uh i have updated them so uh <unk> they're updated in the shared folder too  
mm-hmm  
new ideas  
uh participant three  
yes well <unk> maybe uh i don't know whether that's possible maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow  
mm-hmm  
we could just make that rate be something completely different  
uh yeah  
good  
oh right  
clap is good  
'cause i would fight for line being a <unk> feature as well  
it looks like a pineapple with cherry on top  
under the l. c. d. and for example make the l. c. d. be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand  
yes  
mm-hmm  
but you'd think that the easiest way and the way that how it's intended to be would be just  
that's what we need to know in this phase because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with  
okay  
nope  
mm-hmm  
i think they don't need that big of c. p. u.  
and yeah in the functionality of the  
don't uh count on it  
where isn't i it isn't most in sight  
yeah  
um  
if <unk> you envisioning it  
we've already got it  
that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions  
and these uh  
it i yeah it seems feasible and it would be something very great  
okay uh maybe before uh going on on this subject we can talk talk a little bit on uh  
you can talk into the corner  
like for example that like the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus or meeting series <unk> is meeting series a good word for that  
we're basically just 'cause the two of you will merge your data together right  
yeah  
alright  
so all will go and be detected there  
ballard  
yeah  
yes  
and you could include a button here for the mute i suppose  
and then we do the uh decoding and the and <unk> more informative <unk> uh uh instead of this one  
uh some  
uh but you can write things and of course you can also when you click here uh erase things so we have uh <unk> left  
is that two special colours  
so the actual uh excitation as well  
and we'll see if we can  
like a cat  
yes  
has it just plotted the top colour  
um people made good use of the  
yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow  
or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it even if it lags behind what they're doing  
uh the big lines were like nine  
if it can't control if it can't control your your d. v. d. player and a al if <unk> if you can't get that all in one ultimate remote  
i can find it again  
okay  
so i would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control if you if you like  
if that is the uh  
uh yeah to to make sure that you know it has to be replaced  
good point  
is that everything  
it's <unk> so what can i draw some more  
i think we're getting that's true  
well actually we have yeah to check again yeah  
yeah  
and and they have 'em in a little box in the middle and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls  
<unk>  
yeah but you should be able to activate or <unk> so yeah yeah  
if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent okay  
i'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause i draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw  
sounds good  
but at the end of the day why wouldn't you just use the slides to search the transcript  
yeah  
i mean we we said simplicity is is one of the features so it's going to appeal to people maybe people who have problems with technology  
so the <unk> gonna be a problem  
when you go on to their working lives people who would you know regular yeah  
and drop it yeah  
yeah it's just a scroll  
it's short <unk>  
right  
um  
we're going to be here at eight o'clock  
group of users or because it says below forty i mean  
will <unk> that's as a remote control  
accessories  
so th  
that's alright yeah  
alright  
but make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it  
mm right  
mm  
i think i like it like this more  
yes we could  
mm  
do we want something interesting with it or see  
yeah  
oh the the beeper thing  
mm  
but  
should be in participant four  
we  
'cause be check out what they would be like on a word basis  
okay  
yeah  
it actually it gives you an error if you put it to twenty because there's some things in there which are shorter than twenty  
um  
if you dump it in there  
yeah  
okay  
yeah yeah  
well yeah  
finish meeting now  
yeah  
oh you're <unk> very good in mathematics  
yeah it's  
no  
sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed  
interesting  
um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck  
i think that  
i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing  
real media  
i would rate it a  
yeah but i <unk> i wouldn't want to own that  
mm-hmm  
ebenezer you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal  
mm-hmm  
uh no it has just been email rather than uh <unk> <unk> the telephone type of uh request  
yeah  
and so if you say hello coffee machine it say hi joe or something like that you know and uh  
you uh you can <unk> when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash  
so uh we're just gonna  
yeah well  
and uh and uh but uh we have to make sure that that uh if <unk> has a interest of who's funding the work the they have to have a chance to uh to to patent it or something  
in the menus of the l. c. d. or in the back of the remote control or something like that  
yeah that's it  
mm-hmm  
mm  
how yeah yeah but how do i  
mm  
yeah  
well i think uh first uh this submitted and this will help for the proposal  
yeah i did as well  
like a mouse button  
or not  
we  
nice not to do associated for once  
no tho uh that that can be done  
alright  
you'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button  
yeah yeah yeah  
hmm  
i don't i don't see any possibility to do so because it would wouldn't fit our <unk> design philosophy  
so  
so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down  
yeah that's right yeah  
no  
and um you know when i think about what they are now it's better but actually it's still kind of  
you must change the chip back nils  
ah <unk> yeah definitely they may charge for more money <unk> again some extra bill for this using this recognition engine or something  
yes  
yeah who knows  
mm-hmm  
whoops  
yeah  
end report  
okay it consists of uh three levels of design  
okay  
they're not often used and they are <unk> more or less relevant  
mm-hmm  
i think we'll have to buffer the audio  
it's a two i would say two  
it wasn't bad  
mm  
you know against results that are reported on tree bank  
okay  
or you can uh  
jane and jane  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so we've got function  
just keep it the same  
actually that can't be right can it  
yeah  
you go guido  
oh  
uh i don't think so because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency  
yeah yeah  
well i have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far  
oh  
i get a email back  
um personally wa what i want from a remote control is a device that's simple  
yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable  
uh yeah  
yahoo  
so it's like feeding the p. l. uh p. l. p. <unk> or m. f. c. <unk> <unk> whatever to m. l. p. and taking some context  
okay can i just swipe your power cable i don't think it matters  
well i think i went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them  
yeah  
yes  
television remote control  
a. um as uh a trendy remote control and and b. as uh a real reaction product  
but uh uh the problem was um to do with the <unk> the <unk> they had a relative and absolute piece and uh it's all to <unk> to the symmetry of that  
you could have volume up and volume volume up down and like that  
yeah i think the colours detract a little bit  
mm  
what's the big blue thing  
<unk>  
do you think we could  
like at the moment if you click on a segment it automatically sets the whole clock thing going and stuff  
it though the look is fine but uh still i will give four in that case you know  
uh right what am i writing  
mm-hmm  
<unk> maybe underline  
well we already have research backing voice recognition as you know  
the three pens are underneath  
and so no speech as well because it <unk> it would delay too much the development process  
yeah  
so average  
we'll stumble upon some problems  
like you might put in there oh i want to watch such and such and look a oh that's a good idea  
plastic  
we could have gone through it verbally especially my slides i felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them  
well you um nah  
um  
yeah  
because i <unk> i in the code that i wrote i was like playing also with if if the mat matrix is parse i really don't use it all  
so uh this is  
okay  
yeah  
well they're using the e. r. g. right  
okay  
it'd be more compatible with a range of television sets making it more internationally <unk>  
because i can just quickly generate quickly generate a web page and then just add and take yeah  
yeah a peak  
so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that  
for visitors  
yeah on a scale of one to seven  
so <unk> how should i do that  
because who wants just a television remote  
yeah  
and also i found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control  
and then  
sorry this is i'm just um  
anyway those are that's all i have but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into  
yeah  
yes  
the um evaluation criteria or am i  
yeah 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the <unk> on the uh the back of the  
super super  
yeah  
yep  
it's  
yeah  
okay  
so let's start with this  
so this is the uh user  
uh oh  
so  
no more or less i think yeah  
and you have very good chances  
and yeah the yeah the older people liked wood  
do we think we should invite them  
then uh then you better don't yeah <unk>  
two  
well the opening is what i'm doing right now  
back and okay  
oh no is it  
the second one  
mm-hmm  
yeah why not  
okay yeah  
mm-hmm  
so voice activation  
we don't know about <unk> sharing an office with two persons but at least no problem in <unk> sharing her office with uh marianne  
i'm hoping to have enough time to try um doing that before i finish my thesis  
and the two of you get to play with the uh <unk> components and uh  
okay uh <unk> that's look great  
why  
sorry  
well then we could if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic  
yeah i  
i think so too  
no but here what i want to say is really that <unk> it's not part of hilbert envelope it's part of the d. c. t. signal  
okay  
but you had a way of choosing which one right  
yeah  
we're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day are we  
um high <unk> lines  
and we can point at it  
we will go for the a a a apples apples  
this has to stay on the table  
at that point i mean a little improvement of that it becomes a big improvement  
yeah  
that's  
yeah in segment point one  
yes  
uh okay this is new prototype uh  
so i suppose it does need like high contact yeah you know high uh quality machinery and very specific machinery but  
you should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons  
of our faces  
that's you  
makes your living room more fresh as you watch  
so it it yeah  
okay so uh that's cool  
'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button  
oh  
uh that's the the one that goes like this  
okay hang on  
do you have to be able to <unk> what animal it is  
thank you  
uh yeah whatever that is  
right  
and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after right  
'kay  
yeah so that so <unk> should we go for a a two on that  
well you can <unk>  
yeah  
um user requirements um so you'll be hearing about different trends uh about different things that people need  
do <unk> you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had  
no but you otherwise you can't retrieve it  
how we doing time wise  
so uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then  
okay  
mush mushroom controller  
yeah  
again as i said we can also try to make it to create the trend  
where is it  
yeah  
just  
oh it worked  
uh uh uh there <unk> there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l. c. d.  
what did we do back here  
mm-hmm  
um  
just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy  
sure  
um i don't exactly  
okay  
to capture the slide  
let's take this remote into uh production  
okay  
okay  
it just uh  
okay anything else we wanna discuss  
well i oh  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
or you know however however you wanted to go about it the holder could also be the charging unit  
i'll do that  
hmm  
uh  
next time i concentrate  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
hmm  
like really just getting i think getting one or two best utterances for each segment would be really worthwhile  
now the different persons can use the the screen um at the same time with the with the mouse  
uh you could have but uh it was your first no uh no disrespect or something  
so i'll make an example  
no no  
well that's easy  
yeah  
i'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase  
i think all of that's a <unk>  
yeah but where is the controller  
um think about um sending it over radio waves or <unk>  
yeah  
but i thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well that's what i thought  
are the functions easy to learn  
i mean young and old all age ranges all um not kids obviously right  
so you you think it's better if small  
mm-hmm  
you <unk> you get the <unk> uh the face plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing  
alright  
mm  
yeah  
okay  
so this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales  
numbers are so meaningless to the people  
i agree  
um small and slim i guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't  
uh oh we have a good artist  
if you <unk> turn one side you get one one buttons you turn the other side you get the other buttons  
but i think that's too difficult for this one  
i kinetic battery is a big one so  
this normal battery so this battery  
and we we do have one more functionality  
so you don't use it that much you don't have to see it all the time  
eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier  
uh  
but remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the oh i see so just take out the special colour for the apple and  
<unk> you think uh i i'm user interface manager  
that's interesting  
um i drew a badger  
then it's a simple chip  
but how does it enter in that  
there's some people laughing themselves silly at absolutely nothing while while they speak  
<unk> what is the minimum and maximum  
um every <unk> has uh has its own uh led light  
uh we already try  
i i don't mi i don't mind  
oh okay  
the use of an l. c. display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what i think they had in mind with a joystick  
m. a.  
okay  
um both  
and for all the person of the family maybe so yeah  
which is yeah which is why we have to do it off the g. d. f. as as opposed to the e. d. f. format  
mm  
yeah yeah for every you're so you're to store all this thirty  
yeah yeah  
okay  
what do you mean  
<unk> you saved it  
is it  
yeah  
'kay so it's not the best picture in the world  
not other materials  
um i. d. whatever that stands for  
fifty percent of the presentation have no outline  
so you you should first train the p. l. s. a. stuff then you <unk> this link uh spreading thing and then you <unk> over okay  
but uh at the same time i have some other project i i want to finish uh those project first  
yeah  
why it has to be online  
you could use um red green and blue to display up to three  
or  
do we have um other for lack of a better word skins  
it'd probably be lighting up the key too right  
you're the only one uh okay  
and this  
i saw it yesterday  
so a lot of people participated in uh i think even they're continuing this for uh next year and  
um probably a duck i just i li i like the way they look and they're just nice animals and i like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever  
i think <unk> this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive  
the average is two  
hello  
the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the <unk> your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name  
uh yeah m. f. c. c. <unk>  
but you can understand well  
i wan i'll take one  
um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
which i think we've kind of already discussed before  
um then we will it's a seven <unk> um seven  
oh  
it's okay  
so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better  
the next step is to go for to <unk> is to go to uh  
uh project plan discussion and yeah then the rest of the meeting  
that one  
the last one  
yeah  
mm if we only have twelve pounds fifty  
yeah and it has a a clear top and bottom so <unk> so you could say you know it transmits from this end  
mm-hmm  
the user interface design  
but um yeah it's complicated  
no no no  
okay  
no in the case where they need help in the case where they need help  
two point  
no  
yeah  
okay  
it's from like an earlier project i think so um  
that should be a good uh point  
mm-hmm  
gosh  
oh yeah  
technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one so if you um going to design a remote that looks good  
<unk> uh yeah and general places  
um uh are you sure <unk> what this means a spinning wheel with the l. c. display  
your evaluation  
ben said he he left it out on purpose which is reason  
no  
yeah  
right  
so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have but um we we really need <unk> to discuss the price  
okay  
yeah  
speaks for itself  
if you do not make minutes no problem but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down  
it's been done for watches but i haven't seen that for remotes yet  
but the other is that there will be a time span a kind of reaction to some event span  
but those are very those are really different um theories that are at are trying to get at different things and it and they admit of <unk> you know  
mm what  
yeah  
well maybe only a two or a three then 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific <unk> or specific  
so how do you turn the thing on  
and the problem is um it's perhaps more um dangerous to get mistaken with all those numbers and not knowing why things happen if we just devote numbers and <unk> make new uh <unk> <unk>  
okay  
um the thing is  
it i think you're just saying it comes out of the eye tracker already right  
yeah  
two or three  
yeah  
and oh i think as you can see so the l. c. d. screen does look better uh at the lower end or at the bottom  
so again this may blur some frequency transitions or yeah  
yeah  
and and that was the the big deal  
kind of  
i think we just need channel selection  
i don't know the name of that  
yeah  
mm mm  
yeah  
and and and the hard disk recorders  
yeah  
mm  
yeah sure  
yeah  
or would we contribute to another group  
and if you define the regions so neatly that there's that  
so  
i just uh ended the meeting  
okay  
so  
oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select  
we've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh  
uh a green apple stuff like that with very uh bright tones i guess  
i think it's this one  
um  
<unk>  
no the <unk> over here  
we were kinda going yeah it's gotta feel nice it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start  
i sort of expected that everything would turn out this way but because you yeah everything cannot be for free  
like so  
it's uh it won't be uh we shouldn't make it too big  
and that uh no <unk> i can't i just remember it was a really can you <unk> remember what it was  
and then it's easier to understand for both of us what's going on  
you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you  
so please stay  
you don't see it uh at the ears  
yeah  
must be realistic  
the factor that we've been least successful in confronting  
yeah  
yeah have i <unk> it  
shit happens  
mm  
so we don't have to think about these  
but only on the on the outside not on the button  
we do not control the t. v. set so well  
if you want to move it  
yes  
uh <unk>  
no no that's just the average  
what does it mean in spanish  
so fancy enough means does it comes to the younger people and the elder people  
and with sports on television  
we'd just place them in different ways and then see how they interact with each other  
we we were we were supposed to take take the direct one but we didn't  
could you answer please  
yeah it's true  
mm-hmm  
and where is the voice recognition  
okay  
sort of on that side that side and then the last part looks on the old town  
yeah  
sets of web pages which have good links stuff if you start from one page or something  
mm-hmm  
that's kind of a good thing though you know give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey  
five or six  
this is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of  
uh-huh  
but it should be possible to to um make it  
fashion update  
right  
the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t. v. channel choices shows up and you have your five <unk> down here  
oh  
shuts itself down and  
uh many of our components are gonna be standard off the shelf  
okay gentlemen um uh just a reminder we <unk> we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay  
but we are also designing uh a prototype um to <unk> the conversations  
but in practical terms in terms of recognition uh here we we we have to be clear  
instead of twelve and a half  
the difference only weak line isn't it  
yeah sure  
<unk> so you're simply you're simply looking <unk> to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons  
so but he's uh he's not i think finished with all that thing  
so we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh  
the sample sensor and and sample speaker which is your big item  
no i think most t. v. <unk> have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings  
the one  
and um i'll put any i'm i'm putting anything i do in there anyway so uh  
but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system  
uh well i used the the uh documents  
i think that's <unk> flicking quickly between channels  
and we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour  
try yeah  
uh if you scroll up a little way  
but you can if you've got a spectrum that's split by polarized light  
um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time  
okay  
you know we don't have high tech things  
uh  
i think we just have to decide whether we're doing it  
for l. s. f.  
now is foreground et cetera  
i will need it  
um i'd say i'd give it uh a three i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally  
yeah i think so  
but but uh roughly is is an idea that is very similar to to our idea  
mm-hmm  
the fruits and vegetable themes i don't know if that's going to work for us  
yeah yeah  
like how much money people have to spend on things like  
we can had uh have a out of these numbers which which is that well we should go for it  
yeah i think it's a  
so the idea is we have different people collaborating uh in a pedagogical purpose  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
mm-hmm  
oh okay  
<unk> everything has to be ready  
yeah  
and then leaving the phase yeah  
'kay i'll draw something  
so which were totally useless actually  
yeah  
it's it's common  
um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes  
yeah  
they're not titanium  
i like to do it but i have no time  
it's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one  
that would give you one less  
mm  
do you wanna <unk> do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one  
yeah but i think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit  
right  
so if they pause just where you've got it highlighted at the moment  
what they found was they <unk> people's desires and needs  
yep i would <unk>  
think about it  
we'll we'll uh we will we'll try something let's see what we can do  
you have to have some push buttons don't you  
and you said something about speech recognition  
um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance in this case the television set  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
i try to take consistency if they always stress the wrong part of the word  
it's perfect and  
the the corporation stands behind the product okay  
um  
yeah  
mm 'kay  
and what if we lose the l. c. d.  
so hello everyone  
yeah that's kinda cool  
okay  
i think a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this  
we've made a study so could you go to next slide  
yeah  
take and make them in a hash map or something  
hmm  
and uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover  
we might have someone else joining our uh meeting soon  
mm-hmm  
mm  
okay  
mm  
mm mm  
yep  
which  
actually there were a lot of  
but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand  
okay  
yeah  
hmm  
uh in combination with the finance i um uh i received uh a an uh an excel uh file  
mm  
right  
mm  
yeah  
yeah but what else uh do we have to cut out  
right so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it  
right who have some motion so uh  
um what are we doing next  
i'd i agree  
uh  
mm  
and to make that to make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is can the battery power it  
we  
and the other one  
so um  
alright well point out the advanced chip for now i guess  
tangible  
but to be fair yeah i mean  
so that's another way yeah  
but it at least we have the framework in which we can then test everything and and look at everything  
yeah and the numbers on top i guess  
yeah  
okay  
so is the two piece idea out  
okay  
huh  
that's hard to miss  
yeah  
yeah but uh with these ratings uh  
hmm  
is this <unk> everybody agree with this  
uh to me the only additions  
well th the on the well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time  
so that was a little unclear i suppose  
uh you you can control your video recorder with show view  
okay this is  
kinda christmas you know  
so basically want very simple right  
there is that  
yeah what's what's this cherry  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay okay  
ah yeah  
yeah exactly right  
uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh i feel they're underdog kind of status and they're the  
right  
uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using <unk> clay  
uh-huh  
yeah  
<unk> could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page  
yeah  
no  
and it it if it isn't you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again  
no <unk> <unk> it can also always be more simplistic but two is yeah  
mm yeah you can do that yeah  
huh  
or is he so <unk> i mean you know they've been working on construction there for a while  
yeah  
not sure if uh she can use it  
okay and you have the there's the technology inside that <unk> simple vocal comments  
but isn't the <unk> the fruit like a cover thing because we  
a trendy  
yea  
so it's a medium  
<unk> kay  
mm  
and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker  
is too short and nine is too long  
it shouldn't be <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
oh <unk>  
uh okay if you all agree i'm fine with it  
okay  
good plan  
and so when i done my thing on cost a i had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button  
well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition  
right  
that's not  
oh alright  
line in ratios  
so that's okay  
okay  
do i have to do everything  
mm-hmm  
but again uh getting that ten papers is really difficult task  
hmm  
it's a pussy cat  
but concretely you would use that to get higher quality signals  
so mm are we going to use l. c. d. speech recognition  
for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five  
because here  
i'm not sure how much should be done in the programme because uh  
now i don't know what that is but i think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere  
because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do  
right  
so they are is there are still using that uh desktop microphone or what over there  
zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour  
okay yeah two is fine  
you just <unk> uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to <unk> uh press them down just like a touch screen  
yeah  
you'll be beginning your your working design  
especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs  
the there aren't any extra parts  
yeah  
so raid one is exactly it's means that's lot of <unk> of resources but it's more tolerant  
like  
this can be discussed as well  
just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years  
so my group also asked to circulate the final proposal just to make sure there is no major problem  
that's uh that's so the <unk> user won't be um thinking well uh did the button be pressed <unk> what happened uh  
so it's the people can say well what's that well that's my remote control  
but uh they said <unk> was uh also meant to be checking it and doing things and quiet  
that's not important  
to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're <unk> you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know x. and y. um at the same time  
capable  
oh yeah  
well let's um so <unk> what are our definite decisions on this then as a team  
so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power something along those lines there's an integrated circuit  
it's a rabbit  
board  
yeah i uh uh i uh saved it  
okay  
and uh so if you take uh these two with the with the <unk> uh then of course you should just do a threshold  
like this is just their best sentence for like having function words in a row sort of and every <unk> other i mean this one is sort of the developing a big infrastructure  
and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys  
um having a look at the existing products i found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes  
yeah but that we wouldn't so we'd have to have some dialogue box for opening stuff  
okay  
mm-hmm  
or are we going to uh <unk> evaluate it first  
yeah  
so we are here for the detailed design meeting  
what we have to do now is to go back to our little places  
but but but if they have trouble you know half an hour <unk> and helping helping them is probably worthwhile  
yeah  
um well we see the the the same uh  
yeah we like our fancy phrases and <unk> for things  
so  
yeah and maybe you can make something fancy out of an l. c. d. remote because it's new as far as i know  
hey  
okay  
screen  
that's that's better too  
with two batteries the whole print plate and <unk> and top and if you're holding it quite a lot i think  
great  
yeah and then numbers  
yeah  
<unk> ah look at that  
yeah  
maybe it's easier to to draw uh  
they find that <unk> uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control  
so that was a note  
or text function  
and our final drawing  
the other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful would be to um make it originally we're gonna make it a simple product  
and perhaps heavy so you can't move it around  
i don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it  
which might need thinking about  
uh  
it's okay  
blank  
so or you're gonna bank the script some place and tell us how to run it  
uh this because of our last model was very functional but it uh people didn't like that so our new mo model must be very good looking  
yes yes that's right it's it's onto the chip most most probably not not hundred per cent sure about that  
that was um  
alright  
yeah  
but <unk> you don't think this is completely unusable i guess  
so you don't have to do something really specific as everybody everybody will have to use it it's <unk> the same as keyboards  
okay  
no  
nah yeah the feel  
are we are we finished ahead of schedule  
and um yeah we can change directly  
but they both suggested that it is there is a mono that there there is a mono microphone  
we have two buttons missing  
so as long as in the main <unk> in the programme manager everything <unk> is is removed  
okay  
um and just a little note there touch screen equals many chips which equals many euro  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
so so the fir fir first part that'll be documenting what they've got and then discussing it with robin  
that was it  
mm-hmm  
l. d. a.  
not as much as channel selection but still significant  
yes  
okay  
anyway this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly  
if you have an l. c. d. on the remote control what would you think of it  
yeah  
mm  
l. c. three  
yeah let's think of a name okay  
how  
so they might find that attractive in a remote con  
i dunno  
oh you're fine  
a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair <unk> fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um <unk> program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface  
yeah  
uh yeah i'm afraid uh mm-hmm  
well i th  
um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls  
just a thought  
participant two  
so you can control if you want right  
two euro  
yeah  
so you must point everywhere so maybe infrared is  
so here we see that we the shot at eighteenth and after twenty twos and after again  
how did where did where did you get all your in information  
'kay  
there is <unk> uh just more right right right  
so that's  
i have some instructions now to do that  
mobile phones nowadays  
either this one this this could be the luxurious one  
and you have the <unk> the directory entries of these pages so so <unk> like yahoo or entries  
i was re i was reading the chart to be honest  
there is just one uh one chapter and no menu  
if you if you give me if you give me a cut out of what everybody else has then i need to i need to find a lower cost  
oh mine  
and quite complicated to use yes  
okay  
uh sorry i didn't mean to cut in  
it's spongy  
<unk> assembly cost  
yeah  
i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition given that um the  
uh i think we have to to group to make two groups  
uh  
we needed more play doh colours  
yeah  
why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms  
so that it's something that fits in the household  
so  
and when the third one was finished i wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore  
okay  
mm  
but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since  
i think unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l. c. d. display  
mm no  
it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also  
okay  
'cause as they were saying they like to use blink rate as measures of cognitive difficulty or something  
because of who we're we're you know targeting this at  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
that is cool  
it looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two euros um  
uh yeah just a  
what do you guys like in the user interface  
are we agreed as to what our target group is though  
four  
and go into the other room  
something i miss about my hometown  
various coverings  
oh it's it's just one computer  
um if we find another company who can produce the required chips casing l. e. d.  
speech recognition i think  
i hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh i hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment  
i have a philips h. fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options  
no that's <unk> old fashioned  
i don't think <unk> our customers will like it  
i would every design change is uh i dunno um okay um  
mm  
<unk>  
like the face plates that you change so we could have maybe i don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that  
well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab  
so  
so  
hmm  
yeah  
um for instance you see um on the uh on the u. r. l. i put okay i i disco there is m. m. m. dot <unk> dot c. h. slash v. c. g. i. bin  
easy to find <unk>  
yeah  
there you go  
so um i i think we should we should cut the l. c. d. screen  
mm  
yeah  
hey you've got it uh read only  
but i think that you know switching from one country to to another will be a problem so although <unk> <unk>  
it's  
this is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what i was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing  
i think i think they would be ready <unk> ready to pay more for that  
okay  
and then  
so that's the cat  
so um the <unk> uh the words that uh it gives it are look quite good i think  
yeah that counts  
i'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive  
yeah  
yeah  
uh okay  
but if you have no task you can uh blindly select <unk> good <unk>  
and it i can't actually say but when i'm listening to i'm thinking and i can't tell  
i think yeah with a better uh phoneme recognition rate definitely it could uh improve also the the call routing performance  
no  
yeah because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology and those waves have high  
oh do i have to do it per button do i  
but that's sort of that gives people a bit less control over so maybe we should do it instead that it yeah it <unk> it you can spec  
uh i don't have k. star but i should do  
um financially and and functionally  
i haven't <unk>  
it's more or less used this to compress audio  
so this is the i. d. of a specific segment right  
<unk> marketing experts  
but solar energy is not very practical inside a house because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun  
so i don't think  
no we oh  
there are a few questions that need to be answered uh you already uh talked about it a little bit  
and um also  
yeah  
mm  
um if we could hear from our industrial engineer or designer  
so mm  
yeah  
uh i'm going to leave that up to you two  
well speaking about  
that's that's my idea  
so so that's that's what i'm gonna look at  
are are we admitting defeat on c. or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the t. v.  
but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television  
mm  
i yeah  
mm-hmm  
yes  
um what are our choices here  
yeah  
i agree  
i think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough  
<unk> i know let's do a speech  
yeah  
right right  
well 'cause we have to have both right  
okay  
hmm  
yeah  
it's just one isn't it  
uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something when the <unk> empty then there is a bleep  
yeah well yeah  
number number  
read something recently about  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well she'll have to <unk> use the c. v. s. eventually 'cause we don't really have a good way of doing this otherwise  
but it's probably not and uh not a simple thing  
awesome  
interesting  
that's the thing yeah  
so the the g. d. f. is gonna have that sort of information in it  
if we want to have something sleek and uh you know  
yeah i got it by yeah  
yeah  
right  
i mean we don't have to decide on one colour  
so i have to first of all you know <unk> create tar files and then i can get it back here  
yeah  
yeah  
the real reaction remote  
so jonathan made me promise not to um tell you about it when you first arrived 'cause you were gonna get overload about learning eye trackers and no  
<unk> yeah  
and anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it  
that's okay  
i change channel like this <unk> uh i want to go to twenty five and then to ten uh-huh mm yeah  
yeah maybe do it by cross validation something  
yeah i agree with the l. c. d. screen  
okay  
drop it  
does that make reasonable sense  
and your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it  
yeah yeah  
and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber  
yeah  
but if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh <unk> a user interface that is very complete on the t. v. screen i think that just five buttons are sufficient  
just um  
okay and then and then you would like to assign to this document too where you don't know the labels the same one as this one  
ah  
or not  
yeah i know  
uh  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm mm mm mm  
we can increase the cost  
um the way how it should be controlled by the user which is uh <unk> uh <unk> uh during this part  
<unk> try phone  
radio quiet quasar should be go mm  
hmm  
think so  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
leopard print would be cool  
uh <unk> oh  
and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated more traditional look they're willing to pay uh that  
um  
i mean that it sort of <unk> loads  
well probably the only thing is a banana that i can think of a cucumber  
uh-huh <unk>  
but that's not very similar  
yeah  
yeah in the meetings only in the meetings  
mm mm  
uh but for instance of course between the horse and uh and um the <unk> the <unk> uh uh yeah  
hmm  
um i have a table here about uh the <unk> the relevance of the buttons  
mm  
mm you can just click  
i think it's nice and original  
and also what's important here is the theoretical clarity about what an initiation and a response is  
it comes up with not with the clustering but with some way to compare two marbles okay  
and it doesn't cover anything other then t. v. so i'd probably give it a three  
um the first one was done by myself bruno marianne and <unk>  
bit of light and attention  
we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are  
but yeah  
okay  
well what what would you guess as a shape  
i'm gonna go for the bear which i'm be able to draw very well but  
hmm  
but uh i think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken  
but  
systems are kind of t. v. video combined now or t. v. d. v. d. combined  
yeah yes i i i  
this is for <unk> practical reason and uh also a matter of time  
no we're just developing this product and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public so it should fit to every device  
your training data <unk> no development training no yeah training  
so yeah  
uh we'll see how that goes  
it's flat uh  
oh  
doesn't make sense  
um okay so let's think about this  
yeah  
the order  
you can do it  
very good  
like you <unk> you click on it and and the selection moves and the display goes to that part  
okay  
so let's for example look at  
it still is a special remote control cons uh you know <unk> its form is special and material  
seventeen  
oh yeah it's kind of a penguin  
true  
yeah and more play doh 'cause that was all the red we had  
it's very nice according to the work of our two designer  
'cause i you've got something that's fixed the the p. of w. given z. with respect to both models  
<unk>  
then we can talk more about  
so the display we will put in here the basic uh functions in here where it's most reachable  
those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here but i hope you have ideas about them  
okay  
yeah  
i thought we'd uh lunch uh right now or not  
i've got no idea  
sorry  
are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes  
mm-hmm  
yeah th that's why if you put it in the table be careful somebody will eat it  
just for extra information on your <unk>  
okay  
but um if we were to if we were that the speech recognition  
maybe  
and they are found in um usually the warm countries  
so  
oh yeah  
design  
no <unk> i mean in the l. c. d. screen the small screen  
yes  
didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the t. v. and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and a button for disabling the voice recognition  
the end of this  
mm-hmm  
it comes through the  
make some mock ups some some general ideas  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences i ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more  
oh no i've not looked at it  
i mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice  
yeah and that's it  
yeah  
that's just a regular uh power cable and whatever  
okay  
yeah yeah  
we <unk> have to make a new remote control  
i think we have to market it in the right way that um to say that it is simplistic  
'kay  
okay  
and you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is  
uh that was all <unk> uh personal preference i didn't have  
um as you can see the different roles have uh different tasks  
i'm not sure if there's enough space  
project evaluation project satisfaction for example  
yeah yeah i know  
ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops  
<unk> probably not yeah  
mm-hmm  
basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before  
that's what's hot on the <unk>  
yeah  
so <unk> what kind of thing uh is gonna be  
so  
well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness  
well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so i dunno you can starts  
so from one to seven  
<unk> uh uh with jean uh of the i uh <unk> <unk> corpus and uh uh uh on the other hand uh i <unk> <unk> uh did <unk> some very preliminary work on <unk> the switchboard corpus  
um yeah i think you can just draw the face but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks  
and <unk> uh um what i'll do i'll email <unk> about that okay  
you don't have it in the states  
yeah  
oh  
and so i'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled  
or i mean that's good  
is  
yeah  
we have the video here  
<unk> and you can just be the the layer of the <unk> and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip  
yeah i think we'll  
yeah  
yeah i i might do i <unk> i still th i'm little bit doubtful  
it's <unk>  
um and then uh how do we you're actually so what you're doing is taking all of the the the most important references for um finding argument structure that might i eventually be of some use to a meeting browser and trying to look at actual data and apply and and see like which one helps you figure out what you're actually gonna do with this particular data  
mm  
okay understand  
that's <unk> that's sort of the um but i i'm my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay  
and the the pay the the the program is next to each other because you would go further and back  
i think that's good  
hand held and portable i think is <unk> is important because t. f. t. have just um released um i think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen  
yeah  
so we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and <unk> fashionable yeah content and form  
yeah  
it should be it should be fine you know actually  
broad band  
oh the <unk> thing we actually forgot  
sounds like it could be <unk> a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter more convenient  
um now i mean i don't sorry go for it  
yeah no  
yeah so  
yeah <unk> i in the galaxy distribution  
i think the um session is closed  
an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push <unk> button  
yeah and the users actually  
oh great man  
no  
right yeah  
but for standard actions you usually what do you do you change channels you adjust volume and nothing else  
yeah but we don't use it  
and then <unk> yeah  
um people also had certain frustrations that i think that we could try to take into consideration with  
nah  
mm  
and then the front is made of plastic  
yeah  
feel  
well yeah it depends 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah  
so how many l. s. f. <unk> you're using and  
and uh i was just curious to know have we done any research into how many people can whistle  
so that if you if you're handing it from a <unk> uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the l. c. the l. c. d. and the uh  
no no  
new products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty  
yeah  
is that working  
so we can go to production  
nee one point  
um we also need to look at the chips uh <unk> custom designed versus off the shelf  
yeah depends  
uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better and when uh <unk> six sit six are good it's a good uh <unk> product i think  
yeah  
there you go  
well um  
that was pretty cool it was a high moment of the whole experiment  
and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms  
actually i would say maybe two two function buttons the <unk> we're now using the menus button and um and an <unk> and an okay button  
mm-hmm now it's right  
when it's not too big  
and um yeah <unk> you have the most knowledge about the suppliers the possibilities and uh so i'm going to leave it the decision with you  
no  
the expert uh said ninety five percent  
yeah  
that's not an option  
mm-hmm  
that's why it's yeah it was uh used with uh yeah <unk> uh did the c. function and uh yeah  
and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons but only an l. c. d. screen so i had to uh look on that  
i'm not quite sure how it would work and then i wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else  
you know  
mm  
yeah  
i'll show you  
put it on to c. d.  
but uh th at the time basically i'd been trying to use p. l. s. a. and those types of models on web pages  
mm  
the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit like banana could be black and yellow  
um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen  
but it's electronic so it's made in japan  
uh  
so uh you can mount uh the the the uh  
we dis we di we designed it to be perfect  
both  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
yeah  
thank you everyone  
spend  
that's a one  
so  
yep  
with a copyright sign after real  
okay  
i think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually  
yeah  
oh the customers okay  
hmm  
so i guess we could have a menu button as well  
presentation is  
uh the remote control displays the corporate logo  
that's uh um that can be none  
is that a whale  
or uh or i don't know but i don't want to now invent something new because we didn't discuss about it  
yeah but for example if it's lost in your armchair we'll not see the flash  
did you discuss that  
okay  
bit like this kind of rubber  
instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and  
but  
yes that was one i wasn't sure about 'cause infrared  
you sure  
let's say something rude  
why  
well there are of course certain restrictions you can't have it be any form and <unk> all functions at the same time  
yeah  
i think that's probably a question more for  
mm-hmm  
even though we  
yeah so it's  
mm-hmm  
designers can look into that  
yeah  
will you give  
yeah  
yeah  
so an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question  
um  
yeah but maybe yeah but maybe we we should then  
okay that's not a problem  
yeah  
and so i tried to put it together so that it makes some sense  
you wanna say something  
hmm  
yeah  
uh power i believe  
oh okay  
and there's also just things like tele uh receiver noise at the beginning and or at the end of the and i mean these these are things you can get rid of if it's a  
yeah  
have the solar i think  
see you another thirty minutes  
uh we should uh enter our questionnaire  
um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well  
mm-hmm  
to bring the cost  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay  
a mouse <unk>  
uh uh  
or  
um  
hand <unk>  
okay alright  
i mean most people when they watch t. v.  
yeah  
because we have enough space  
to do  
three  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
oh yeah  
we plastic  
one is just a straight extraction from the ascii and the other one is any post analysis that that adds information by <unk> it  
yeah  
so what you do is you say if you're looking at a series of meetings you just say well our whole document comprises of all these stuck together  
well actually actually this <unk> this was not in the paper  
okay  
is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes <unk> with a television  
mm  
but uh the easy of uh th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it  
so um i wan i wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made  
so what about the point where a part becomes the construct  
except for that i think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design  
so let's go for <unk>  
hmm  
and then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people which is of course our uh group the people we aim at  
um okay back to our project  
well i could give you an i. d. but it'd be quite difficult to actually give a topic a title  
oh you  
you know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right  
mm  
mm  
rubber design  
okay  
well volume and  
where should we start  
yeah cool  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well it's big right  
so norman will explain to you  
alright  
nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly so it can either  
okay  
'kay  
uh  
uh <unk> unacceptable for older people i guess  
but mm yeah  
i think it's innovative  
oh not many i guess  
here i am jo  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control  
excellent  
so are you guys okay with that does that seem logical  
mm  
hmm  
that was more of a a gimmick  
which i think is a technically doable thing so  
plastic inside  
so  
but i think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip  
it's kind of like essentially if it is like hundred twenty hundred hundred g. b. data space  
oh  
yeah but that's okay 'cause they all have different underlying part numbers  
mm yeah  
but on the other hand on the other hand uh if you have a remote and buy a new t. v. that isn't incorporated in the remote  
but at this point in the in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there  
oh  
mm i haven't actually got a display on my screen  
you can <unk> your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here so you can do your <unk> presentations on this screen  
yeah it's a bit slow so  
mm-hmm  
which i believe is  
they are doing these things together  
well <unk> but we don't wanna build it into our data path  
so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype  
no you can erase the turtle it's alright  
okay and now you can erase  
okay cool  
well you're the secretary  
and let us include two nice features into this device first power on and off can be made fully automatic  
yeah  
interesting  
okay  
it is  
i think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it  
we could um the environmental factor we didn't bring that up again  
yeah  
at the same time it's important that it's easy to use  
uh-huh  
yeah i think it's not well done yeah  
yeah  
so uh i don't know if even if you want to consider this but these are the different things that the company makes  
yeah  
um and also there's a kinetic energy possibility  
manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use  
'cause slogans are usually quite small right they're not like huge so they're <unk>  
i think  
oh yeah  
mm  
yeah  
but uh anyway you need you need to have windows to make these  
because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people  
hmm  
and there is a big table in in excel which you can look at  
sorry  
and for you it's the user requirements specification like you said at the start  
um and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that  
why not  
yeah  
another thing it's talking about there is the l. c. d. screen but there's no figures apparently on that  
the the the the um the source filter type parameters and then and then learning the you know training like a <unk> speech recognition system  
so in in the case of many user interfaces  
yeah exactly  
but if you ever see the t. v. saying like go to page one sixty on <unk> now that's what they're talking about  
but it does depend how much  
um  
yeah  
yeah that's it  
oh gosh it will be here forever  
<unk> <unk>  
mm-hmm  
so that should help some  
so that's just easy  
or on the table uh there should be well  
i i can  
yeah if you want to to create a web page and just copy my email into it or something  
monkey  
what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are so you know definitely you should be looking at something quite different  
<unk>  
<unk> thing so i can't remember what it's ca it's the component  
but now i think people  
uh <unk> <unk> you two should should i think think this over uh <unk> <unk> what what functionality  
so they say we put the fashion in electronics well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion so  
yes  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
because the topics it cluster it it pushes a document if it is pulling a document into one topic it pushes another topic away from that  
they like the fancy stuff yeah  
n. t. s. c. region one  
because there it's in cache so that if i put another video with the same name they th they will happen again  
'cause we want wanna ask ellen ahead of time if she wants to come along for a discussion about oh well that's that's fine then  
no prob  
and what about people who want to use digits  
and that will send it to your television  
but then it is iterative  
okay  
so  
mm-hmm  
oh there we go  
do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though  
mm-hmm  
and uh well if <unk> if your remote picks that up also you they can display which programme you're currently watching  
so sort of  
it's just another it's just a an idea and i don't know  
there you go  
and the price was like it was twice the  
record play machine and stuff like that so that's and it's much yeah  
oh no no no  
but like  
and we have five minutes  
yeah  
uh yeah yeah i'll go sure  
with four in the middle  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
this one is uh i suppose for the younger audiences  
think a lot of the time remotes that come with t. v. players and t. v. <unk> and d. v. players like they aren't  
<unk> the unique style maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark  
so this is from the experiments we've done so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user i think  
um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation  
yeah i think so  
well  
okay  
um  
which we estimate with several steps from these measures  
um just so <unk> we can work off of them see how fashions have changed  
yes  
um the top goal of this <unk>  
no  
so for example <unk> and the finnish marianne are master students for right now  
how the we did we do that  
like <unk> uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and  
yep  
um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it  
mm  
so are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana  
um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes um you each have things to do look and feel design user interface design  
okay so we need to  
yeah  
right  
no no be careful  
we can use this  
right  
yeah the for instance a simple question maybe you can are we sure that it can work on a single computer  
right  
sure  
uh uh  
there's the in the same way that the yeah h. beta emission is a process  
hmm  
yeah  
mm yeah yeah yeah  
and then there are the push buttons so you can have basic push buttons or a scroll wheels like you have on a mouse  
mm yeah the people below forty  
problem  
so who wants to draw  
hmm  
in right within the budget range  
uh  
and that um splitting at category boundaries um splitting at topic boundaries would a nice thing to do rather than just splitting somewhere  
you <unk> have to put something on your box  
i if we knew that before we <unk> we could have made the the choice between what yeah  
you prefer it  
banana colour  
why not  
so and then but then the tricky the only tricky thing that we hadn't figured out was the phase information  
ah  
oh yeah yeah no i see what you're talking about  
i guess  
the sentence from the previous segment is being carried on then that's when you don't <unk>  
ah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than you know  
and if if the if i if it's a  
oh let's kick it off  
plug it in that's it  
mm-hmm  
we used those  
maybe like user friendly like a little  
mm  
okay  
what do you mean  
yeah at least you can write on the <unk>  
you do this  
it uh it separates our product from others uh as well  
yeah  
no no no no no  
i see this a little more smoothly than the last one  
what's this this one  
then have an hour and a half then have lunch hour and a half coffee break hour and a half  
uh th because on the the company website uh what does it say  
than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine you know to say hello in the morning  
the cow  
it's it's collaborative work  
so there was not really a process of uh  
they could just screw up  
six  
yeah  
the first item  
yeah  
'cause i th think that's quite interesting  
yeah and this one  
i think it's going to be <unk> <unk> yeah it's th with the regular chip yeah  
a way of being segregated from the others in a different frequency or something  
about three papers  
everybody  
okay  
yep  
yeah simple ones for  
yeah  
what  
i i i really think we need to uh  
<unk> for a docking station  
um  
it's quite large  
that's it there yeah  
no uh uh  
you mean the external or  
mm-hmm  
ha  
the product the pro  
oh oh oh  
uh  
i'm afraid i'm a bit too slow  
yeah  
there's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides  
for example for the dialogue acts and so on  
mm  
let me bring up something about  
did you prepare  
that's okay okay  
but uh  
we do  
no problem  
that's just  
is it cheaper to do the v. r. or to do the uh touch screen  
in <unk> yeah uh we just remember that here we we still have only one machine to do uh the slide video and audio acquisition  
so you've all drawn land animals so why not draw an animal from the water  
i think we can improve on the design  
cool  
okay  
in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings  
you just concatenate an x. m. l. file together  
so uh uh uh <unk> it  
but we have some summary working and that's a good basis to start from  
hmm  
um  
they do they don't look fruity enough  
style reflects a fruit inspired colour design  
who knows  
pretty straightforward  
and we're gonna evaluate the product and close  
yeah  
okay so the buttons are on top here and you flip it over that way  
okay  
yeah but it has to be <unk>  
this is the version <unk> that comes with l. c. d.  
what's this  
um second uh it should be technologically innovative innovative  
every time i use it it could be like for example i can use a simple toggle switch  
so if we lost the um remote control perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself  
yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function  
and uh now the the shape yeah a curved case  
but that's a problem  
right uh  
are these for any extra controls  
is that you or alright  
and it should be weighted by stuff like the hot spots and um the key words in the search and stuff like that  
but  
so uh no it does look like it's uh m. s. n.  
the user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the <unk> pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume  
yeah yeah yeah  
creativity  
yeah no you've got line in there  
uh well this is our design  
oh it's  
okay  
that's pinocchio  
how many utterances <unk>  
i think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits  
so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no <unk> i don't see the  
yeah  
yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something that you scroll with your thumb with the arrows and then confirm  
'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use  
yep  
i dunno what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary  
i am not sure who was programming this calculator you know  
if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze you know it's spongy then can i skip the rest  
okay  
we're gonna need chips right  
so that's it  
yeah uh but it it's one one thing it's three euro  
you know the the the battery will last  
mm-hmm  
yeah the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well  
yeah  
okay  
yeah you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever  
oops  
like as an optional thing  
yeah we evaluate the product  
evaluation  
yeah  
and you can you can  
okay  
mm  
yeah probably not  
uh  
divided by four is two and a half  
have we agreed on that  
hmm  
well it's  
mm-hmm  
okay so the question is now i guess we need <unk> to  
so alright  
'kay  
um  
no it's three euros  
in standards and yeah  
yeah  
and yep  
yeah  
but but <unk> <unk> fortunately because of he uh because of properties of hearing more or less  
mm-hmm  
but then what are the use of raid then  
just so you know easy to learn will be separate so don't overlap them  
okay  
for the title deadline  
the kinetic thing can we just skip it because uh you have to shake it but that's not really innovative  
okay  
uh  
show them where to either give them directly give them help or secondly point them in the right direction  
yeah but  
so but there are many applications where you really can use it because you don't care about <unk> delay one second <unk> delay  
well once you get this information your frequency and uh your vocal contract or how it's called  
anyone got any suggestions  
okay  
no just if they if they buy it  
okay okay  
yes  
sure  
huh  
so you know  
you can handle them  
no no i think that's i really don't wanna do that to be honest  
sort of  
why  
so l. c. d. screens should be easy  
yeah 'cause i wouldn't need to bring a monitor or anything i'll just need to bring the box  
uh the buttons hmm  
yeah well and and  
yeah it's possible yeah yeah  
oh  
yeah i suppose  
the line is a bit off  
yeah but  
i'm looking at looking at it right now  
yeah  
it's about the best thing  
right  
um speech recognition limited buttons organic design  
not that you can do that on the board either  
yeah th  
but is there any other i mean okay that's true for the for for that element but we have to take all el elements into consideration  
basically  
we have the <unk> or flat case  
absolutely  
but it's not even sure because the background is quite similar and uh it's it's it's not that sure  
so it <unk> it may be too complicated for us but it's something to keep in mind anyway  
no it's uh  
yeah  
yeah but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone  
i think  
yeah so it's a fuzzy design and a unique design  
um and we want to be different  
a star burst is a type of galaxy but it's also something that can happen within a galaxy  
yeah that yeah next meeting we should be  
and on plastic times two and then we uh are there  
i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california  
and then each one <unk> frequency sub band is more or less uh  
and it's it's not technologically innovative either  
this is used with speech recognition this  
i mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited to to build in menus in the screen  
but i think that with the current um price that we're searching for we're well within even on the lower end of the uh of the market  
<unk>  
yeah  
so well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say <unk> channel one and the <unk> the remote control gives the order to the t. v. to switch to channel one  
i think actually pretty early on i'd have thought  
a one  
oh well no they might see  
it's  
black then is a regular colour so  
or only only scroll wheel okay  
because i really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me i would want to have that just  
and then the personal preferences that i will suggest  
mm-hmm  
one i give it a one  
construct  
and what if we have some day a fire in <unk> we will lose all the data  
okay  
right  
it does nothing extra  
yeah  
okay  
very basic  
corresponding to breath or a little noise  
hmm  
um okay so  
yeah  
it looks like almost nothing  
maybe we all have to agree on a common  
well we discussed the design no sharp corners we rounded it off like you see on the other screen which is fine  
oh yeah  
i can  
so did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply  
very true  
'kay  
so uh i found one paper interesting  
uh oh  
but i i had the feeling that they had also some frame dropping that was uh no  
and the colours we got down and the shape maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or  
well you could  
but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh you know designed in interesting substances  
fine anyway  
mm  
excel  
just so we can flick  
<unk> mainly if you turn the uh remote control on you have to <unk> you have to see from one till zero channel and volume  
oh yeah yeah  
paper size a. four  
right  
then yeah still the slide is there  
you can't avoid him  
well you got you got twelve  
okay  
mm-hmm  
if  
because the t. v. you also  
<unk> relatively so expensive just these <unk> small buttons  
no hold on you it wouldn't need three internal time scales  
but that's not the end of the world but we might have to set some things up  
as far as i know so far uh they did similar works on meetings document <unk> meetings  
i've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy you don't even notice  
but  
mm-hmm  
here  
um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy but um  
oh it's very capable of being squishy and fruity  
but  
i think that we should use uh <unk> yeah  
remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly  
mm-hmm  
no it <unk> certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh you know visually very distinctive  
we we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah that's fine  
although it does apply to the telescope  
well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end  
hi  
yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be  
so the remote control it <unk> only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch  
orange of course  
but um cutting segments down is a <unk> a low priority but it it will help ultimately i think post processing wise  
mm  
<unk>  
so  
very useful  
no i think that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah  
i don't know these things  
but uh maybe i can take the interceptor from you and run it once on my to have it  
what you like to take from there  
yeah i was working on some per personal preferences  
i thought forty five  
um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it  
paste  
so forget about c. t. s. at least now i think because it's again  
thank you  
mm-hmm  
according to your distance to and the angle maybe if you have a stereo system  
so  
you often discover that they weren't actually solid facts anyway you know that they're i think the boundary between these is kind of fluid  
yeah it actually work that too  
mm-hmm  
say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or <unk> something  
um i ha i have a feeling that the um <unk> the w. three c. browser does it  
two days  
yeah it's rainbow  
response and  
you can <unk> get out and they they <unk> never get tired  
so maybe we we can have a speech recognition in  
oh  
very good drawn but you can see a cat from it  
powerful and easy to use  
yeah  
and another thing with um lots of surfing we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable  
no the boss  
i don't know  
yeah  
yes i just did that  
okay well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now  
i'm not sure you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important  
yeah yeah  
launch different lines at once  
yeah  
<unk> yeah  
so and basically out the output the g. d. f. is just gonna be a whole series of events you know with start and end time  
that's true  
um i mean and and for that matter a lot of <unk> native english <unk> <unk> aren't going to be so true to um  
and with this you can uh yes go to through the menus and that can  
yeah yeah  
costs are within the budget  
alright  
oh in a way if that's your argumentation then put a visiting person with a senior  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah sure  
yes  
no we have sample speaker  
that is uh is in <unk>  
and it's got just few buttons quite low looking and all this stuff we already  
yeah  
or i guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting  
have a modern have a traditional have a you know and so so instead of them all looking the same  
right  
yeah i i agree i agree  
so something that really takes this and they recognize only that uh that part  
i didn't even mail to to <unk> i must say  
you email  
uh it's it's a <unk> it's like yeah  
oh it came there on three minutes back so we are i think we can just press the okay  
really great  
oh alright  
but it can be uh battery consuming no  
because use linear phase or  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yes  
yeah no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends  
um this was our first concept  
yeah  
can you not do something like just like not measuring the f. zero or the amplitude at all  
so <unk>  
well maybe <unk>  
but they are first they are inter oh well integrated into fifteen bands using oh classical way like in m. f. c. c. <unk> or in p. l. p.  
uh so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better  
yes  
yes they can  
yeah  
so i think maybe that was another reason for um just having  
i think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote  
okay  
so keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this  
so at the moment i mean again we should be at a state where people can load their own <unk> okay  
um well anyway i don't know it's just the first animal i can think off the top of my head  
mm  
um but no it it can continue into the next segment and that's perfectly fine  
is it i believe i believe check check the dictionary  
industrial designer um which is  
there you go  
but i think more important than looking at um whether parts of the meeting are highly interactive or not so interactive is uh looking at what sort of task the people are trying to do at the moment  
yeah  
but also be <unk> some at least some people basically know how to uh uh write faster programs  
so i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that  
the signal is audible  
but this is near  
okay  
um if you wanna make it a particular shape use plastic  
what else can you do with a television  
mm  
well i think we should ass i think we should  
but for now what we've got is working in the range we need it for so it's all good  
mm-hmm  
okay  
unfortunately i didn't get the the bar on the display working just yet  
um also send signals to the um infrared bulb which will be the part that actually what  
yeah  
ah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that's right  
but yeah no i mean it's a different movement so yeah  
come up with new ideas alone and and work on the project and then um after we've brainstormed and and thought about  
well the email said it was a quite a small component  
if your name is in the first half of the alphabet you can move and the other ones can't  
yeah  
okay so do you want to  
<unk> you'd maybe need a code word  
grey yellow okay  
have you got the bottom of this page  
yeah  
yeah  
yes but uh i uh haven't made it because uh of the time  
yeah  
something like that just <unk>  
i suppose  
just looking at examples <unk> you just don't ever see the logo on a button it's always on the actual casing  
so it it needs to be rubber  
did you go around  
we uh we had some uh we had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside  
yeah  
on the volume ones  
some ideas  
uh  
the and maybe he wants to think about that more and say well there were several candidates for the addendum alright  
wonderful  
maybe make it like fruity colours or something  
yeah  
you say  
um so i guess i guess that's it  
and you can choose a nice one  
yeah  
yeah i right  
i had to fly to germany to do a teleconference the same as you did for the interview  
no  
as to what they want  
uh  
no but uh that's what m. l. c. <unk> does  
okay thank you  
'cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common which are channel and volume  
mm yeah  
do i have a choice  
okay  
i'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps  
mm  
one was right  
con components oh  
so it's external  
yeah  
but yeah  
just we were gonna see what you thought the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons  
it's not something you can point to  
mm-hmm  
so anyway i think this is should be  
it's a first step  
but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation  
alright great  
i'm not the person for hardware  
okay  
so you'd maybe put <unk> fan uh fashion at three rather than two  
okay  
so <unk> even if it's something as brief as mm-hmm we're we're gonna go ahead and <unk> that  
uh it it's it's not yeah  
what's this  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
and you would <unk> probably still need um your values for the words um perhaps for for um the keywords that are displayed  
so we want it to have a modular architecture to be able to improve each uh layer separately  
well dunno  
okay  
which is basically what we discussed  
so you do is sending them an email  
but we don't have that information anywhere do we  
uh like the coffee machine  
uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore  
uh hu oh oh yes  
right do you wanna start  
yeah i mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you  
<unk> i think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes something that can make it stand out slightly  
yeah  
okay  
right okay um  
um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big  
control  
i mm this is not the yes  
mm-hmm  
oh  
we're wanting to make a name for ourself  
so that kind of <unk>  
mm  
yeah  
you can use uh well for example anything  
yeah it did  
let's see  
did you know that  
wow  
let's forget  
you know sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where  
but it is our company colours  
um  
okay  
oh good that worked out well  
yeah  
<unk> so do you wanna go for curves more curves  
i think it's to get us used to using the pen  
perfect  
um for now we're having a lunch break  
so we've got channel and volume  
but i <unk> we can find ways around that  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah that's true  
it's a ratty  
for the first time well it was hard to get the <unk> um the actual <unk> on the individual buttons  
here you are processing one <unk> band frequency band right  
and also remember that in this day in age we need you know like a hundred button too  
these are very important documents of course uh these drawings uh  
which we could <unk>  
what  
yeah  
but if you wanna make it in international japanese uh people got uh rather small hands  
alright  
but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range  
we can save on the on the functions  
change in the <unk> spectrum of  
oh  
and it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language something  
mm  
um and we can quote stuff on that  
but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control  
uh since i don't have much time so i'll input the connections to all this components  
how it how conforms to the current trends  
is that standard  
what's the blue part  
so um this is all about  
yeah  
if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it  
yeah  
um  
mm-hmm  
but i mean given that it's coming from the same basis as ami  
mm  
i sort of like this one like i i don't know why it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking i dunno  
um  
mm  
mm so that's the point  
these are the edinburgh people no  
you were more in charge kind of thing  
mm  
right  
a standard or something  
so we should kick the board's uh well  
yeah should be easy  
yeah  
well we won't i mean we won't use 'em till they're ready obviously  
and you know about complexity  
that's easily enough handled just using standard techniques  
yeah no mountains are just in the far so that's not  
yeah  
and i count them like this  
twelve euro fifty  
um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where i need uh uh kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um <unk> <unk> do we go for a custom designed chip  
like how it's comfortable and <unk> sits in the hand  
<unk> i dunno if my mom ever did it but i remember other people's moms making like home made play doh where you just like make the <unk> and make some sort of sort of dough  
change the batteries ever again  
i you don't doesn't have to be perfect it's just 'cause i'm not quite sure if i understand the difference between the two  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
it should be damped lyman alpha  
uh i'll try it  
well since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you  
okay  
isn't  
because we have a problem  
we shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control because elderly people will get th lost  
i believe it's easy to put two <unk> into a stereo signal  
the curve is uh in a dimension  
you really like the parental advisory  
yeah but i've ta uh right i'll just re do it  
the boss is always the last one to go home  
and i don't think you're gonna be able to figure them out uh very reliably  
escape  
i think basically the core functions we want and then more advanced ones  
one one uh very important thing i was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option  
um i can see your point about the number keypad  
and the <unk> thing do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here  
i think people wouldn't like it  
good lord  
'kay  
yeah  
in c. d. m. a. or g. s. m.  
i've just done one channel  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
at first the colours of fruit  
someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine  
uh there's no there's there's no way you could tell that just from the the raw movements or or something  
yeah do don't worry you you you speak with mm mm  
um yeah mm-hmm exactly  
oh  
so um  
we don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable  
i had one of those and my brother and my dad could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally  
yeah  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
twenty six and a half  
yeah  
no i think when this meeting's finished like officially there <unk> we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
anyway  
we'll just run through it yeah yeah um  
oh right yeah  
good luck  
um also uh the remote control should be used only for television because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex  
this is a teletext button  
yeah like  
well i was i was thinking uh since a t. v. is uh mostly used together with a v. c. r. or d. v. d. player or recorder  
yeah well or i can make it smaller  
and will somebody buy it if we don't  
and then you can flip it open  
alright  
mm-hmm  
or two people are talking together  
and then uh what i'll think about it  
okay  
yeah you can  
one uh <unk> with parent control and one without and i would would buy the one with  
i would have <unk> uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful  
so  
uh <unk> did you get that  
okay  
by now i just had a look at the yeah data um and actually the average f. zero deviation is only slightly higher for the positive ones than for the negative ones  
yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break it's it's much more uh  
uh-huh  
i like the idea of the uh multi plate  
mm  
yeah i have yeah  
well i mean this is once again a  
i think we've got a big hill to climb here haven't we  
so this is selling costs not production costs  
and uh in the middle the the mute  
that's much better  
apparently  
'kay welcome  
i think data's the same as spectrum 'cause the data is a spec <unk>  
or i press button but nothing's happening on the t. v. so is is something wrong or something  
yeah  
so i have  
what do you mean  
i would also th yeah but i would also th  
apparently  
this is fine for making a <unk> for project presentations  
uh <unk> <unk> what do you thing about uh a scroll bar  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
or anybody else strong feelings about remote controls  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i mean i've uh yeah  
yeah  
um  
oh  
the the publications are sort of like um how do we deal with packet loss  
mm-hmm  
what we doing about nebula again  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um  
you can put also vibrator inside  
uh-huh  
yeah  
oh yeah i see  
it doesn't have to be but we can  
oh  
it doesn't matter  
like i think we should go for like for one group not for the whole corpus  
i that's true  
because you want to put your hands you want  
mm-hmm  
yeah but <unk> <unk> but yeah  
some of the extra functions over here  
yeah  
so anything that you would like to know or  
yeah that's right  
'kay  
and with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design  
is it manageable  
so i have an here  
put  
<unk> good  
overwhelming  
oh that's the old old one  
so  
you'll be looking at the construct  
well you did become more assertive the the second time round so that yeah  
yep  
like if you want to go from  
so it would need twelve buttons  
okay  
it's got an l. c. d. screen <unk> only got two buttons and a joystick  
no  
like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something  
but  
yeah  
uh this is the power key um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on  
so uh the shapes of the  
i don't have my presentation  
we have to remove the  
yeah  
so i don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year  
and they don't have the buttons yet  
okay 'cause 'cause right now i don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
the side but do you touch between the the these buttons  
a fly yeah  
gosh must be some telly addicts out there if they get r. s. i. from their television remote is all i can say  
or just anything that i can  
yeah  
not like a skin but like a holder almost if you could do like um leather options or wood options or something  
it's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish  
definitely  
you open a plastic cover and you see some u. s. b. interfaces some some interfaces for adaptor  
or  
oh that would be class  
yeah it's uh  
so as long as you hit them dada  
it worked  
see 'cause i think that um just to make this <unk> more efficient  
um so yeah  
yeah we made a mistake i tell you  
why  
sometimes it's under or equal  
i think latest <unk> soon as the call is out  
so  
but <unk> we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th <unk> the main  
thank you  
or  
so um on the energy well we decided  
mm-hmm  
which is not an option  
uh participant number three  
a kind of yeah  
mm-hmm  
and the microphone  
i don't know how mu maybe we would be more interested to know that it's not the same people more than knowing that it's the same people  
it is an option  
okay  
that's the wee blue one  
but  
okay  
scroll wheel no  
yeah  
because it's true it's true this that uh that things sped up tremendously since i came  
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah  
hmm  
these were a couple of findings first page of three  
you just cut out <unk> bands and just use <unk> or whatever  
but  
mm-hmm  
that's sixteen buttons you reckon  
mm-hmm  
well she shares an office so which is why we were thinking that it wouldn't be a problem to <unk> keep her with a spare person  
they had something  
okay  
ah  
yeah i think an l. c. d. screen might be good in theory but not as useful in practice  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
yeah that  
if it <unk>  
wow you've your first page  
okay  
this was your size but i think it should be larger  
yeah  
you see that there is uh okay it's not a shot change it's a motion actually here  
nine ten  
mm yes  
what makes this thing attractive  
it was one remote i think different colours  
there are some exceptions but most of all have uh infrared controls  
because then we have to confront her with our  
battery and solar yeah  
yeah but that's not a technological thing that's another thing i that's another marketing thing  
so you are  
that's how we are going to make it uh more trendy  
yeah  
and you see it it's running through it  
both in i i or we just have to choose  
it well that's that's what alex talked about yesterday right  
yes  
so why's it how is it different from the <unk>  
and it it does start to get a little bit <unk> non linear towards the end  
the battery and that i think that the chip takes the data and presents it well without sort of scattering  
so round where  
and and they are skilled uh by using it  
oh and have you you need to then also press on yours function f. eight so the blue function key at the bottom and f. eight  
or  
um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room so  
it's it's fine so  
it doesn't really count you guys  
so you can do that automatically this kind of things  
it's quite uh limited  
and uh well the things that make the <unk> the voice  
so in terms of recognition fifty percent goes away  
so just keep yeah just enumerate up for the next number  
mm-hmm  
oh the wait and the sit  
that's um one things they did right at the beginning is they've got this big <unk> stop list and they just ignore all of those throughout the experiment  
yes we  
i didn't go <unk> back far enough  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> class path is like this long  
mm  
you know whether whether the you know the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow  
no no no it's okay  
a actually it depends it depends what kind of <unk> you want to add into it  
a double sided remote control  
<unk> okay  
yeah  
i i didn't use it  
i don i i <unk> i have to disagree though  
yes  
that's right  
so i think there's  
and then the n. x. t. thing is just a <unk>  
you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are  
hmm  
mm  
yeah  
it's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the l. c. d. screen  
mm-hmm  
investigate  
but i think that's just from the whole point that you can't tell which clustering is <unk> better  
so so yeah yeah  
i mean it's hard to tell uh i dunno  
i will uh i'm not currently working on it  
that's the problem  
so i mean yes it is because my display is programmed inefficiently  
a colour  
so like  
if you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does  
<unk> 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one t. v. set so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere or something  
so i think it's four  
so uh coffee machine  
uh the chips  
mm  
they think it's ugly right  
if it won't works then we'll get something else  
so maybe we could have like  
yes  
yeah  
u. v. and optical emission line ratios  
uh well this is the total interface uh that <unk> of the l. c. d. screen  
yeah mm  
you know some of these  
slightly unconventional or attractive uh  
if you want me to help yeah  
uh  
mm-hmm  
um you know  
okay spongy materials  
only one or  
oh yes we are talking about but they have the same shape but actually <unk>  
oh right  
it can be an interesting i don't know  
and absorption again  
we'll have big discussion i suppose after that so  
i think you can turn it this way also  
that's  
i'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for  
yeah okay  
okay  
yeah  
it's about um because what we can uh record is uh sound uh origins  
sub bands power spectrum  
you probably  
and if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip which is a bit cheaper  
obviously  
which which two parts made it made that came together to make that construct  
what are the new experiments you are having in your mind  
yeah  
okay  
six yeah for me  
reduce the number of unused buttons  
yep yep  
i mean but so this a point  
yeah or how about i just click  
but that's not a bad thing is it  
yeah  
up and down and then what another button that would say that it's now being used to <unk> round the l. c. d.  
yeah that's needed yeah  
okay  
and yes  
this just an application that runs on the machine  
yeah  
but you guys are the ones that have to <unk> ultimately create the product within cost  
um all our um <unk> um uh <unk> um notes should be kept in the same file  
i was wondering uh  
i'm not sure about the sponge  
and when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you  
um well  
uh  
but yeah well i <unk> mo mostly yeah  
yeah  
um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age  
so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
yeah we we have we have rubber but there is a problem that i forgot to discuss with the um with using  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
seven  
um yeah i'll make sure make sure they can actually pick up the <unk> um audio signal as well  
you have to hold it right  
no but in the proceedings you can find them  
i i i would choose rubber  
so  
you see what i mean  
anyway so <unk> uh let's just see what happens  
<unk>  
without the solar cell  
you can do the l. p. analysis on each sub band yeah  
yeah some  
mm-hmm  
all we're doing is dumping it as output that you can load if you choose to  
thank you thank you very much  
they're just standard techniques  
right  
yeah he's for finding the likelihood for full frame and then it's basically likelihood ratio test  
on your desktop so it goes save as or  
okay  
to pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable  
yeah  
i guess the problem is due to what does that <unk> mean  
last sentence  
yeah yeah for example the l. c. d. you can take it you can put it put it back in  
it's sort of coming as a shock to me now because i was sort of in this mindset  
well for example that that's what we should think about  
th yeah that's five  
yeah  
yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place  
i don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls  
no  
fancy colour  
we can discuss that kind of things i think with the  
or had you already incorporated that  
it's i think it's <unk> there there are five normally  
that's location sensors  
i think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext but along the same lines access things on the screen  
yeah  
you may already know but the thing is if you want to send this call for abstracts  
we have these kind of things  
do you want an explicit list  
so  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well maybe i can then do it one two three  
and i import this until  
well you said it should only uh work with one appliance  
right  
yeah  
i think i would break it  
i'm gonna have to think on the spot now  
yeah  
like the buttons are standard okay the l. c. d. panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic  
so um we have one minute  
well it says only for television here huh  
okay  
yeah  
yeah it i'll maybe i'll have a look at the <unk> stuff anyway  
so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d. v. d. and radio and or just only  
but if i have some you know sub goal some long term sub goal  
basically  
ah yeah yeah  
yeah  
and that's sort of and they they've plotted some graphs about like where they show <unk> like one going from zero to the one and the other going zero to one and like how the how the landscape changes and how i the parameter changes  
ah good question  
intermediate types  
yeah  
okay  
this one  
it it might be important for the sale  
<unk> because you can um we didn't talk about it but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal  
evaluation that's that's bad  
at least five minutes i think  
<unk> yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
and you could co <unk> with your house or whatever  
the slide were just there i mean but they were no longer use as a support  
i'm happy enough with that  
our budget's twelve point five  
when you uh the menu you have to go there there there there  
um now the the age structure we were looking at um i mean <unk> we had usage by age structure  
could <unk> still put them on the side  
i'd i could draw <unk> the ball idea  
r. c. because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal  
but it it just works out in the way that words which are promiscuous and which occur with everything all over the place have very low a scores on that  
yes  
ah okay  
we're meant to be <unk> we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so  
okay  
yeah  
oh probably i didn't get it too so the framing is actually <unk> distant  
alright  
yeah  
i respond to either  
mm-hmm  
um  
okay  
and also presumably they've  
uh for me personally it is everything fine it may be having good design  
uh basically what i wanna do here before we get into it uh too far  
but it's not bad leadership it's just sort of <unk> fairly strong you know  
i don't care about it  
mm  
but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um andrew <unk> can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not <unk> not just a uh um a a simple remote control  
okay  
okay  
so  
uh i don i don't know  
well it can still be a you can still extend past the hand  
yeah  
i wonder if it bounces when you drop it  
um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote <unk> con controls try to create something new and people would like to to buy  
mm-hmm  
speech recognition potentially flat screen interface l. c. d. interface um  
yeah  
uh-huh <unk> i like that  
so okay i'll take this out now then  
my documents or not  
they were good  
well just leave it at that then  
yeah  
i haven't looked at it but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens  
yeah  
and say they are in this period well i mean uh they're probably not given what i've trying to  
i don't know how much preparation you guys did but not a lot  
but uh yeah  
or if you're adjust uh th find one one line  
yeah  
and in the end we will <unk> uh count an average  
did anyone ever check if that's actually a good meeting like or <unk> comparably to others  
i would've thought that um i think all the collections and things implement <unk> already  
okay  
just  
yeah  
doesn't sound very useful for you  
the titanium and so it's very uh  
so i'll <unk> i'll also have a look have a look at that  
that's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future fruit wise  
that's a simple on and off switch  
possibly  
take it again but systems should be out  
okay  
yeah  
so uh that's the kind of thing uh i mean that's the kind of measure the <unk> statistical independence is not on single words  
and uh uh another what uh  
because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen but the elderly only look at two buttons  
no uh not too much buttons or mm  
do i press escape f. five  
uh the n. uh  
yeah  
okay  
you still get the display in the summary  
mm-hmm  
uh <unk> <unk> yeah  
<unk> swap channels  
um hopefully a jog dial and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well  
sure yes  
i can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group huh  
but contains the extra buttons like say the number buttons for instance  
i could see this thing unless it's reinforced having a problem with the  
um  
so  
apart from cognitive <unk> which i think i'll just do in five hours three hours  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
no the advanced chip is needed to have an l. c. d. display  
okay  
it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller  
and the other things that they've made and i like put down some like inspirational words like that i got from looking at the pictures  
we don't have a product name  
and so i think going through the presentations that um were given at the work package six meeting where um and i think it was um it wasn't <unk> was it anita or was it oh i've forgotten her name  
hmm  
if that's something that would stay on the t. v. itself for example  
that's the same yeah  
um the teletext is outdated the internet is important  
yeah  
so uh i was just talking about the pas project  
okay  
yep  
beta line  
okay  
right  
basic questions like you know does it turn on  
no  
yeah just to change the index files as well  
but in in in at the end it's still this long  
i mean maybe if you you don't measure things in terms of word error rate maybe this sort of information does actually mean something  
so that's why the code is a bit more complex i think currently  
um are all those those one that you showed where they were um <unk> met silver metallic looking  
i think would be cool scroll wheel  
like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button  
um from the spectrum you can transform the the magnitude spectrum and um um build model of the person  
but we have to take care of the t. f. t.  
so yeah for drawings  
yeah  
'kay  
alright okay  
not just in electronic fashion  
speech recognition i take it  
well so  
alright  
yeah  
okay so currently you are not working on this  
yeah uh i think i think they made some uh special effect in this d. v. d.  
i believe that is the end of our meeting  
no no  
um okay well i gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now  
that's another one  
<unk> i mean let's just keep on talking meanwhile and i'll try to start that up  
notebooks  
mm-hmm  
computer adjusting yeah  
um the shape all the shape problems are solved  
hmm  
yes  
once you've yeah once you'd learned how to use it i think it is a lot easier  
two point one seven  
you do get the idea eh  
no  
uh what do you mean by that  
sort of like little pictures rather than  
<unk> is better yeah  
so it doesn't require it it's more testing it does not require so for this we i mean if you put the two cards on the computer  
yeah  
anyway <unk> be so the findings is <unk> be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes  
something where you can read an an um fair amount of information  
the lighting in the room changes  
i've uh  
yeah  
okay  
yep  
um one issue for the buttons is depending on which material we use  
and that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu  
so alright  
yeah because that's i it's for television  
mm-hmm  
definitely  
yeah because it's robust  
yep  
i'd be happy with a two  
so i'm gonna have start looking at that as the next stage  
no you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere  
oh i see so if maybe if we had an l. c. d. up the top that just did a number on it right  
seven  
um if instead of a constant light up on the on the remote control if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again  
do you think that you will be done by may  
mm-hmm  
because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting we'll have to hurry up  
so it  
yeah  
like we can we can play around with it a little bit  
<unk> but the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things i guess  
there's nothing that would make me spend an extra <unk> few euros on that one rather than another one  
um we could also use wood or titanium  
so uh  
okay  
yeah  
this time  
no it's th yeah  
oh okay phew  
and then this directory from outside we have to take care that okay not only the video name this u. r. l. is not accessible  
um and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um  
i mean i would have thought they'd make it able to  
and you are applying some linear prediction model which is trying to approximate the spectrum right  
yeah  
yeah  
one <unk> button in the middle where you do the most important functions with  
but this was really quite successful like in this conference <unk>  
i don't know if it'd be if we'd still have a remote or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel  
okay  
thank you  
maybe no not <unk> for  
yeah  
i  
okay  
then it's not that difficult i can easily regenerate the <unk> and do all the experiments again  
mm-hmm  
i think we would put stop putting the in we could get confused  
yeah and on two  
mm-hmm  
that's clearer  
so i i still think if it's cheap enough functionality wise to include it really should be in there  
yeah  
yeah  
mm yeah  
<unk> mm i dunno  
for o. g. i. <unk>  
yeah we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station  
and and less buttons than this isn't possible  
i <unk> well let's send out the call as soon as possible see what reactions we get  
are we the same on the bottom line  
but i don't know if it's worth the effort  
okay uh slash video browser three frames  
uh-huh  
maybe we could think about how could be more you know streamlined  
and we uh  
but one can imagine a commercial system uh that that that <unk> steven cox used from nuance probably had all these things  
we've chosen rubber  
so we want double curved  
yeah  
digital  
so this is the presentation  
and the buttons in the middle  
okay  
two interfaces is that what <unk> should we <unk> say  
or just for you  
that's good  
hmm  
no you can use <unk> yeah  
but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and  
i used to always love smelling markers  
okay  
uh what do you think about a back and forth come up uh button  
we can make this as a style too  
mm  
exactly  
yeah  
yeah  
why because um i um steve lay quite a lot of um weight on um you know uh surfing through meetings  
oh we'll see  
so just keep it simple make clear buttons easy to use  
it needs to stand out  
you pass it round to have a look  
yeah well this is <unk> this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes  
alright so that's uh  
oh my microphone fell off  
okay  
right right  
mm-hmm  
right  
just a logo and then like ninja homer right okay  
yeah  
come on that was the <unk>  
okay  
it's not relaxing  
you should put the laptop uh right into the square  
um well the remote control has <unk>  
the user should know  
okay  
so  
okay  
we thing that fruit and bright colours are  
yes  
yeah that's why i i <unk> uh  
yes  
well <unk> <unk> what happen what happens there is that the the two the the existing parts basically cease to exist and a new part with a new i. d. starts existing at the point where they're joined  
yeah  
and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to t. v.  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
right  
it's the next generation thing but it is going to come in couple of years  
maybe i can do more with this  
and you're gonna do some product evaluation  
bless you  
white board pens  
well it might work one time huh  
okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one  
so  
where does it go  
yeah  
and buttons would did we say  
yeah  
yeah  
we don't know unless it would make sense to  
yeah  
okay okay great  
advanced chip  
what <unk> <unk> what is <unk> what is more expensive is to um take the decision finally  
but they uh  
polymer yeah  
and then we're gonna evaluate it  
then you still need two additional buttons i believe  
ah very  
you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the <unk> functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click  
okay  
and so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing  
thank you <unk>  
yeah i think i think that'll be good  
i don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative  
so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote  
huh mine has this and not yours  
oh  
so at that point you should have a line up of a. is on the construct a. is on the mouse  
yep  
but as they don't work on the low level so low level it means basically okay take the speech and extract the transcription  
yeah  
okay  
yeah <unk> yeah <unk> yeah it's a yeah  
yeah  
no  
but if we  
yeah it refuses to <unk> load the clock for some reason  
yeah so it's not too wacky  
it looks like a ribbon  
three four  
yeah  
okay and and you find the point where where what  
okay  
four feet  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
blank  
we've gone for one of the cheaper options as well  
do we retreat to our to continue our  
yeah okay  
it should be a really simple signal though so  
envelope yeah  
it's next wednesday or thursday before she's back  
yeah but it at the moment but at the moment it's also an <unk> level  
and th the they should be spongy also because they're they're rubber too  
just elder elder people would would buy it but  
so the advanced is for the l. c. d. and the regular for the joystick  
'kay  
of course you've all got the similar emails i believe right  
mm-hmm  
this is this is the actually basically some theoretical proof like maybe if you want threshold you can see and he's coding from uh <unk> like uh  
it it's just like a uh globe in internet explorer  
it's a bit  
but it's it's not it's not big thing  
but it's once once the mm um gadget uh <unk> uh the voice of the speaker  
oh okay  
like the watch  
okay so it's scale <unk>  
okay  
um  
so the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control  
mm mm mm  
with these four points with the room for creativity in the project and leadership and teamwork and the stuff we had around us i guess  
of people they needed to be near or people they would needed to avoid or anything like that  
yeah because i mean anyway right handed people would be able to scroll with it so i if the majority are right handed it's uh  
mm-hmm  
should try to reduce some parameters by tying  
on the t. v.  
mm-hmm  
so it will look like something like this  
well i'm half way through  
did you  
yep  
um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes  
you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this  
yeah  
but then again if you think it of the amount of you know amount of use it's like  
they use zap a lot um uh fifty percent say they only  
yeah i think white board is useful  
uh have a look  
th the i  
okay  
mm  
so uh where to put what button  
so i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller  
it's true huh  
um  
okay  
nah  
which is where all the main information is uh contained  
yes yes  
so um we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t. v.  
so which you the industrial designer  
'kay  
i'll just just check what it said  
yeah well then that's covered  
i think we can just go to my presentation then  
ten  
it's easy  
zapping  
yeah maybe we should go through yeah an uh evaluation  
mm-hmm  
uh  
and then <unk> children will love it  
now is would this be considered just a standard uh um  
and we won't and establishing the full set will you know take us much of the project  
and you'll just switch it and now it's the sound to switch back  
yeah they uh that does look quite promising doesn't it  
yeah because most of the people yeah  
uh so for interactivity this is the only slide  
six and four is ten  
yeah  
yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed will it also uh cover up the l. c. d. screen  
so sorry  
yeah  
see 'cause you're supposed to uh have training in  
that is possible that's true  
the board  
do something on the t. v. the t. v. responds and reacts as well  
and maybe a menu button and so forth  
uh but uh please just don't keep this as a kind of thing  
and then <unk> you can really start to to some regions of the table  
but it looks really pretty too  
yeah  
well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around  
two okay  
but raid five is then then twenty percent copy only  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so is that <unk> is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything  
we have sample chip  
yes  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
for myself i would like to say uh april may  
okay splitting point okay  
i'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design  
i'm happy with five  
mm-hmm  
just <unk> you you you know your buttons  
but speech <unk> can be possible  
yeah it depends on the <unk> production  
uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then  
because we decided that it's <unk> not that important  
but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface  
uh i didn't get a chance to complete this one 'cause some of the tools that i was given were frustrating  
i mean fruit shaped  
we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all  
so i'm saying a week from when i send it out  
but i'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the <unk> like the thing no  
they don't really do anything  
we can he can use my laptop as sort of like as a as a server as a sound server  
yeah on my on my laptop  
some way well there are <unk> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
so there is there is another case where there wasn't a space between uh  
if that makes sense  
and i think what you're saying you should probably draw this right is that they you know  
the meeting will be forty minutes long  
okay  
and what <unk> what about the uh  
yes  
we can uh  
no  
yeah  
and we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is  
so do you know i mean it's obvious how to use it but you might have to think about it first  
okay  
well fair enough  
well  
yeah  
j. and j.  
i was thinking the residual in l. p. c. fit of the hilbert envelope not this  
okay  
right  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i miss a few buttons but  
i try to work them out they were quite abstract and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it  
yeah  
okay i guess there there just really wasn't enough to transcribe there  
just s. uh so just to know who they are okay  
let's based on what <unk> on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic  
if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it then that could be  
<unk>  
okay  
no  
so they can see our faces  
uh  
so  
okay jolly good  
well you you can't define 'em that way  
yeah if the costs are under twelve and a half euro  
batteries  
okay  
i think we're all um pretty <unk> on that  
yeah 'cause what i thought main  
who would like to go first  
yeah you can have some fun with the buttons it's true  
hmm  
um i think in your case you're quite interested in the location  
they're i mean my segments overlap in the same way as theirs do  
but i look at it and i'm taken back to elementary school 'cause they look the same  
yeah absolutely  
a feature again  
uh kinda like this  
you don't know why  
uh what do you think  
um can we have a phone can someone  
and uh then uh you can uh you have a l. c. d. display  
uh sub shot  
but that's seven basic buttons right seven buttons without any adds on without special colours or form or material  
yeah you have uh thirty minutes  
well now that we've decided on our  
i'm sorry  
i would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays  
okay  
if i come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings  
got the l. c. d. screen  
yeah alright  
they like i guess use the buttons a lot  
you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone or you can push them with your  
one two three four yeah we're ready  
okay  
in general the the early adopters of a new device are young people less than more than  
um  
did they really said it like that  
is an approach where um th uh you divide the space in sectors  
mm-hmm  
i dunno if you see something else important or  
it's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use  
was it insured any idea  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but the info  
is it  
they suggested power options solar cells hand dynamo and kinetic power so you shake it and it increases the power  
but we don't we don't need it evaluated for the presentation do we  
good thing  
then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons  
silver yeah  
session  
but the weather was really hot the south it's more than thirty five  
yeah  
seems to be a fairly  
<unk> we can use uh it as a as a game pad  
b. b. c. one  
yeah like last week i just not done anything  
i don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or  
yep mm-hmm  
but we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen that's looking at age groups  
<unk> we want to it's simplicity  
can you erase ears or yeah  
finances that's what we have here what you drew  
mm-hmm  
no  
the thing  
yep  
so then uh for now i think it's better to instead of doing p. l. p. and delta p. l. p.  
mm-hmm  
mm yeah yeah  
no remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds  
well yeah it's new  
oh  
competitors right  
this may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services  
classical way  
okay  
uh our target audience  
twenty two yeah  
yep  
and uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition  
you can manage all this yeah  
it's just so <unk> the objects is like a separate level of analysis  
it's not essential though i think  
no i mean  
is  
so  
we  
yeah  
actually um a couple of times where they've repeated a word i've put a comma between them  
now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla  
nice okay  
uh me again <unk> the marketing expert  
um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel  
yeah it's motion yeah it's not a cut  
it is not in terms i mean for me for example it was not in the sense that uh after working a little bit on language you <unk> that this kind of thing do not help simply because most of the words uh have nothing to do specifically with the subject you use  
mm-hmm  
two weeks ahead of  
so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique  
mm  
no but i mean to say that if you if you if you if you if you give him the scripts and ask him to run uh the  
dude i think we've had internet for like eighteen years  
uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want th the issue  
but then it is always something that must be done outside uh the uh normal activity  
yeah  
yeah sure  
so what ideas do you have for it for the new remote control  
is it gonna work  
no no no  
it's i it's done by it's done by hardware  
well i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot you know they get thrown around  
uh-huh  
and i think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons 'cause that'd just be so standard  
whether it looks like wood it isn't <unk> it isn't wood but  
hmm  
so i think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria  
yeah yeah  
uh  
it's evident  
yeah  
usually it's already on t. v. or something like that  
okay so what was it control uh f. eight wasn't it  
at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface require more buttons etcetera  
like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions  
uh well this is quite interesting  
to be replaced with a regular chip  
yeah p. l. p. numbers ninety five database is there fine  
yeah  
<unk> <unk> but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition or train the voice voice recognition  
oh  
okay  
yes i agree  
mm-hmm  
it it's just just to mention that  
just don't <unk> don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them  
so it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing  
as you can see twelve point five euros per unit  
we actually have a  
that's it  
mm-hmm  
oh okay i'll make sure i'll i had some problems with uh the <unk> the the first minutes  
but uh it's sort of quite solidly booked uh for <unk> certainly <unk> what six days from ten till five for two or three of those days  
book cases or something or yeah  
um and i just the idea is just to get everybody to um i usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic  
right right  
yeah well at first i was really stressed  
okay so so here you have to choose either many many things to store and huge computation uh  
mm  
so they're on my they're on a  
uh  
uh open  
mm-hmm  
mm  
so it's it's uh but of course not going to be it's not going to be a kind of thesis about this  
so do not <unk> make a new file  
how big  
so  
i did  
okay  
right  
so you have l. p. c. coefficients which you can transcribe into l. l. l. s. f. <unk> which are right exactly  
nah okay i i it's my opinion that i  
mm-hmm  
or i wouldn't  
right  
so  
and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger because that's a major that's a  
yeah  
so we wouldn't we wouldn't wanna do the same thing as what um she did in this case  
so and uh um the the the well looking at room for creativity there was  
i my reaction is no but  
yes  
do they have to work together or two separate choice  
yep  
remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most  
we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then  
then i found uh two different kind of remote controls the multi function uh remote control with many possibilities  
like this  
and if i don't have to generate any new results i'm also on the other side then  
so first to we have to make a small painting  
i mean the point is that olivier will <unk> you have i mean <unk> since one year uh you have always been saying that you want to be involved in this and so on  
true  
um  
yeah  
anytime wednesday afternoon i'd be cool i think  
so basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components  
i guess what i'm meaning is neutral hydrogen should be in there  
so in that sense it doesn't make sense that you are going too much in the past and then you are trying to compute something which is not related  
okay  
um the known technology can make a cost very low  
mm  
yeah  
so the joystick was not an option  
yeah  
yeah but but perhaps more than half  
yeah i think since since we were discussing some um design issues then i i i would like to continue okay yeah  
mm-hmm  
just spinning and not <unk> i would say  
because i think a market will be all kind of people  
or or at least be <unk> <unk> creative enough to think of toggle switches mm  
well  
yeah  
so you've got the volume in orange on design there and the the channel is in blue  
and yeah there is some compression factor which is again when you're computing that auto regressive model from f. d. l. p.  
i'll figure that one out and put it up on the <unk> or email you  
uh also symbols tend to fade after a while  
okay  
um  
yeah  
i'm just going to look at my notes for a second  
i don't know what h. v. c. stands for but since they're complexes we can cross it out  
<unk> mm-hmm  
huh  
so we're looking for  
it's just it's <unk> stupidly but at least it's jumping  
yeah sure but  
right  
but  
four point eight or something  
mm 'kay  
and you  
the length is gonna be <unk>  
but  
yeah  
i mean that's quite a cheap way to do it  
mm-hmm  
is it fashion  
like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice good morning joe  
we  
because uh i remember when i was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to <unk> to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a <unk> it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching t. v. and say oh t. v. thirty and just run  
topics  
so  
'kay  
okay  
yeah how presentations are hardly handful of like <unk> five or more  
no but a star burst galaxy is only a galaxy which has a star burst in it  
i quite like the design of that uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base  
uh what does it feel like  
yes you're fine with that  
is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote  
how many  
yeah so just to meet the user requirements i would just do a <unk> short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um  
very good uh yeah you th yeah  
gonna have to <unk> have this ami corpus linked in no time  
yeah  
uh  
so there  
and then one euro left  
do you want to just carry on with  
this one here right  
and uh voice recognition the software open source software exist already  
i don't know that we are that innovative to tell you the truth  
although it's hard for different countries of course  
yeah i can see by the ears  
what goes wrong  
aesthetic yep sure  
okay  
yeah  
yeah then defines itself  
well okay <unk> we'll see  
oh yeah  
actually what's the <unk>  
a. a. rechargeable batteries  
i know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones takes ages to work how to use  
so we come back to a more richer display  
mm-hmm  
um and then if <unk> we do have them illuminate upon contact they could illuminate yellow  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
okay  
suppose there's like the the white board or whatever the presentation is over there the speaker is more probably is going to this way or that way  
why a badger  
uh or make it ourselves very <unk>  
maybe it could it could be on the bottom so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here so it sits up  
yeah  
and by doing so oh no hold on  
so the case which one uh is it in the end  
mm  
hynek also told about this cohen <unk> cell phone which he was showing to to work <unk> uh with the l. v. c. s. r.  
you know you could you could do it yourself actually  
that was sort of the inspiration for it  
cool  
yeah  
it will assign it to that category and if it's typical for another one it will assign it to that one  
um we should definitely avoid the big square block look  
so explore a shape  
but i haven't put this plan together yet  
<unk> and plus i think  
see how uh  
work  
but the correlation between those two facts the <unk> there's some fancy planning language about that  
okay so we we're looking at <unk> for both a uh volume and channel change  
it doesn't really actually sound at all you know what it is  
it's not getting a bit complicated  
so this is your  
well we maybe we can think of that later  
so it's hasn't it's yeah  
power button always yeah  
mm-hmm  
lights yeah  
so  
yeah  
so i can understand your point and i would agree with you but this is our design spec for now  
whereas in in the revised edition if they were all just black there'd only be one uh mold in the new parts  
yeah i have used once like this dragon that was kind of good like yeah  
yeah we have other uh remote controls to create  
yeah round it up to two  
yes we did  
oh  
but we could be wrong  
but yeah  
instead of <unk> here we have two buttons here up for up and down  
so something like that we we should do  
no but  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay  
but i like cats because they're so independent and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing  
yeah  
so  
both its it's cool  
which is not as uh these these two one were had i think ten i think  
and that way because we're attaching what would be a small button to the t. v. again say what  
yeah  
so you you're  
well i dunno what i <unk> shown on that board  
uh yeah c. m. s. c. c. v. n.  
choose it  
from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent and thirty six to forty five fifty five percent so i think to um  
well for example  
the remote control is easy to be found  
mm  
'kay we've made a prototype  
so on the technical side of it it  
yeah  
um again stepping back in time again there  
which is sort of why in our proposal we had it completely as a separate room  
so target reached  
mm-hmm  
um okay so we've basically  
and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway  
oh no  
yeah yeah  
i think that should be marked  
yeah  
think we're being generous here with three  
okay i've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah  
uh solar cells are useless  
yeah  
shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion go to a three  
that's like you know a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened  
and i maybe you will transform it  
maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product  
no no <unk> no this uh cohen you mean like uh uh  
and that's like several different dimensions  
and we can discuss all these things in our party  
i think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped it might make it more complicated to use  
yes but they don't explain  
oh  
uh  
we can  
oh is regular not simple  
yeah because quite often uh an object class is defined by a <unk> feature  
yeah  
yeah but i think there's a big distinction between the these th i don't need a <unk>  
of course  
like uh is the small part of interaction is is exchanging some information  
uh make something re that you are using very vague expression  
some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control  
<unk> <unk> <unk>  
like you talk to it  
yeah  
so i couldn't copy and paste it but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right  
yeah they are  
shouldn't we start with the most important parts  
no uh we we have uh yeah  
hey  
oh okay okay okay  
are you left handed  
okay  
gave it  
um i think think a one 'cause <unk> with a voice recognition you could add anything you want so that's like um  
think it's like this  
okay yeah that's good  
yeah  
hmm  
so do we think next week that's what we're gonna talk about  
they are the paid  
um and the receiver okay and the power are things that you won't have to care about  
well you could do some on both sides  
okay  
yeah i never did get a picture of those so i don't really know  
i it's just something we have to deal with  
but they are the same right as uh as uh and then also is there is some more work actually can be traced down  
not on off video  
uh maybe it's one of your tasks  
i uh will <unk> present uh some statements and we will decided together <unk> what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not  
but you can give your views based on technology whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not  
i haven't i haven't taken it into consideration  
mm-hmm  
ah ha okay  
just showing just showing how just first how better this is with respect to bag of words and hopefully then how you new uh <unk> p. l. z. given d. is  
that's what i see  
six seven eight nine  
uh don't want to make it too complicated easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff  
four sorry  
in the end we did get it working before  
so yes but it's probably just because if you look at the other one  
no <unk> zero  
nope  
yeah  
okay  
yes i think  
it would be a half hour um diversion from my morning routine to pick up stuff  
mm  
but uh it didn't work out too well so maybe in sort of um  
and then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like i dunno like here in with the  
yeah that means that's a <unk> it's a process or it's a it's a type of photons that's not the continuum you're looking at  
so okay  
'cause we make them in different colours so that they uh  
for instance  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so that's the figure that i was just talking about there with the different demographics  
and this size here i'd suggest this be small like quite small  
i. e. that had a vaguely non remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice  
uh  
i can't remember  
working design  
next  
the idea it didn't have to necessarily be <unk> a hinge that was just one idea though  
but i've moved well i haven't moved it i've copied it onto the c. s. v. yeah  
uh  
oops  
slide show up and running  
put  
<unk> so typically the eye will move right  
okay  
um  
'kay  
i mean i guess that that will evolve uh when we get a response from people perhaps  
and  
now i don't think the summary at the moment is what we wanted to be seeing the words like oh and mm and exactly exactly right sure  
um the thing i remember like i have to find out how to do it without redrawing the display each time  
no  
if you  
because then we have the call thing we have that away and look at the boar <unk> stuff like uh  
so they were working little bit together  
yeah  
it's soft  
uh like simple chip yeah  
'cause if we're looking at the whole lot of meetings we'll consider each meeting a document in sort of terms of this algorithm  
mm  
yeah the easiest thing is in programme manager where it makes the summary  
guys  
any uh thing else you wanna add  
it  
right it's just not yeah  
and you miss all the the body language and things  
it was a really daft situation  
it's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really  
but  
oh  
and and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery to have your uh sample sensor speaker  
mm-hmm  
yep  
many functions and very easy to use  
well i think we gotta fill out another questionnaire  
yeah  
yeah well i mean it depends if you like looking out over the old town and the cathedral  
any of you anything to add to that at all  
mm-hmm  
so i'll just give it a two and make this a one point five  
um so uh we need to i dunno exactly what  
well i'm accustomed to the channels being on top  
have to really question  
you can uh  
well so so it's so long as it's x. m. l. n. x. t. will handle it won't it  
so five by <unk> ten  
i think  
yeah but the performance is really bad at the moment on that one though  
seven is the highest uh  
yeah  
about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting  
yeah you can uh it's pretty easy but  
i mean uh i don't know maybe you'd wanna disagree with that  
so the di the <unk> the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just  
this <unk> features and this uh <unk> uh <unk> uh o. g. i. features and all this  
two or would it be three  
video browser  
okay apparently uh he has no time to to work on this  
and the in that case  
yeah  
in th okay but that rules out a universal remote control  
other uh  
yeah okay  
you got to choose first  
we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel  
and you have two constructs suppose we have two sub constructs  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and uh this one here is a white board  
i think so  
what  
okay i think we're there  
so that you've got your l. c. d. t. v. <unk> and everything so maybe the small  
yeah  
well in that case that majority has  
oh hang on we haven't heard  
again  
right technical functions design  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah yeah  
of one sort  
and that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often  
um so that's the logo in the upper <unk> uh right corner  
so is it okay for your presentation  
yeah  
but  
yeah i think it i think it does  
alright  
okay so i if you come back now you  
mm-hmm  
and and um you know uh error merit <unk> error measures yes  
i think the i mean our aim is to make something different right  
mouse position of the second and i don't know a common mouse action there or something  
yeah  
so but  
yeah yeah  
yeah basically yeah <unk> we need to generate again p. l. p. <unk> but wave files are there  
okay  
i don't know  
yeah  
no  
you  
single curved or double curved  
okay  
uh that's kind of nice  
so  
maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there  
we should just try to make that if it's possible  
so you are <unk> to do something which is part of the permanent record that yeah okay  
yeah  
yeah  
i think tell the guys  
and from that we would just select what we are displaying  
right  
mm-hmm  
well but you've got the company logo on there which would effectively be a stick on badge  
maybe  
you can pull it out first maybe  
i don't th i don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls but if you see elderly people  
um  
i do think that uh <unk> t. v. <unk> support <unk> multiple kind of remote controls  
yeah  
yeah  
and the the ninth  
okay  
or l. c. d.  
mm-hmm  
uh  
yeah  
not sure how this is gonna come out  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
but yeah about the speech thing it doesn't have to be hand held or close  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
but even people are doing suppose in <unk> there was uh some challenge for speech synthesis  
hope so  
i think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really to to see how <unk> th both those work together  
right  
<unk> if you uh promote a kinetic um i kinetic remote control i mean that would <unk> sell better than an a normal remote control  
the actual position  
and  
right okay  
okay  
yep exactly  
right  
are we going to be supplied with the clay is what i want to know  
so that should be in  
i think this simple this simple <unk> view that we get that you can just like pass things into and then check when they got clicked really  
oh yeah i saw it there  
in i in the <unk> in the topics in the in the human topic <unk> um so you've split them up by topic at the moment  
um or yeah just the idea but i'm not sure  
so you're next  
uh that they get lost that the uh you know they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury  
so we want it to be stand out that way anyway  
um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip  
so <unk>  
right  
always like a phone  
just up somewhere <unk> uh besides it right  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button  
<unk> <unk>  
yeah  
you can't sorry  
twelve point five  
but  
that's interesting  
no get away  
i thought of an idea like this  
you me i don't know he's even if <unk>  
okay  
and my main difficulty was the the time pressure  
um another possibility  
hmm  
broad line polarization is that a <unk> feature  
um but and i think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the <unk> the buttons and things like that  
but um if i can  
all th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh  
why not a hand dynamo then  
value a. and value b. both as attributes for  
oh that's <unk>  
and i think and i think that size of uh display was about what i had in mind  
okay  
so it's rubber buttons so it's not really spongy feel buttons it's just rubber buttons  
yep right  
yeah the end conclusion  
yeah  
<unk> yeah but those go together  
right  
no okay  
wow  
yeah but th yeah but that  
of our company and the logo  
um the three things were look and feel innovation and ease of use  
could we could we not get rid of the curvy the <unk> the <unk> and focus on the menu being the best interface  
yeah  
so so i think for them uh this type of things is going to be useful uh at least for this task  
conceptual design meeting  
it's it's okay  
but i'm very happy to to go with that  
okay  
yeah but  
is good to just to indicate i'm doing something it's sort of like a reassurance  
physical sense yeah  
cool  
it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so i think we have to do something very simple and i think we all agree on that point  
and hand every time we re calibrated the damn thing slipped yeah  
oh  
and uh with the other sections you uh um you you use some other theory to look at them  
i know i'd <unk> i'd be surprised if we can get anything working by next week  
because we're working strictly as a team here and uh <unk> nobody's working equally so uh  
okay  
what  
a meeting say and that would be a topic segment  
do we have both sides  
mm-hmm  
yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so  
the second concept is a fancy controller um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive  
oh mango that that  
ah uh  
and uh remote controls are bad for  
i've got the <unk>  
okay  
that would be okay  
hmm  
yeah  
whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important  
maybe we get a a final mail  
right  
yeah right  
yeah but of course <unk> you are also human  
so yeah  
you have a these  
okay  
okay  
because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh  
let's buy more  
mm-hmm  
i'm assuming  
so you in effect are losing information about what that page is about because there's so many things pointing to it and they all average out as  
alright  
yeah  
but  
and you got  
the which is pretty much the same as these existing models just maybe  
it's it it  
yeah  
okay  
how mu what rating we will give to these products  
what do you reckon five six  
um  
i have some informations  
okay  
that's it's something that breaks  
mm-hmm  
and the bleep signal <unk> uh you told us  
but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly  
you know it's like more vulnerable and it adds nothing really you know  
yeah  
yeah  
like speech recognition of course it's very interesting but people don't use it so much as <unk> just coding just telephoning right or just  
and we would have one very big thing off line  
right you <unk> you're gonna stay here  
yeah  
both  
yeah cat voice like there are like they they have few  
wait a second  
oh dear  
we should i think we should just have a long session in the computer room together and like now that we know a bit more what we want  
do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this  
that sounds good  
from uh my presentation show so  
say it for the camera  
oh okay  
okay  
those who wanted to have it pink  
you'd mark the whole thing  
yeah in the new design i <unk> would say it's three  
mm  
remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill  
i don't know if that's that would give an output  
so um  
yep  
right  
would you change the cover  
my god  
no no i started with the d. c. t.  
euro  
maybe that's nicer  
processor um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had amplifier and transmitter are all standard  
their <unk> really tidy and when you work with people who use it all the time there's stuff everywhere  
but but i dunno  
yeah sure  
right  
the digital pen was okay but <unk> was really bad  
it's easier than the regular uh remote control  
something spongy  
so you you you suggest to go <unk>  
and the answer to that was no  
all the <unk> everything will be in digital than analog  
yeah  
no it it's it's uh quite a bit yeah problem to do that kind of thing  
yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money we can push up the the price  
so you have man in like in in uh in one <unk> in one font and then the o. as like  
so  
how <unk> how do you do the summary  
so  
yeah  
i think  
it's a bit sketchy at some times uh you're not gonna get good always accurate results  
okay  
depends how it's gonna work  
um  
yeah exactly  
and <unk> that's also <unk> <unk> relatively cheap to cast  
but presumably the he put it on the <unk>  
and the general function of the remote would stay the same but you could change the the way it looked  
yeah we have so many colours already  
hmm  
yes we're gonna talk about the evaluation next week  
um the case  
and the shifting is still the same or not  
yeah but we could go a step further because some t. v. <unk> have the uh possibility to adjust brightness that kind of menus  
oh and firstly i wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose  
okay but we have to <unk> to agree upon something because uh we only have a minute left or so  
yeah  
leadership  
yeah  
i just think well you know for the sake of three quid or however many quid it how many batteries does this thing take  
we could do a flat <unk> a flat case a curved case or maybe even a double double curved case  
there the <unk> white green rabbit  
yeah  
that's not really something you can point to  
um but um i could check back for you but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination  
the con the con the constructs are already tagged with that  
yeah  
um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for rama uh <unk> design  
okay i'm going to save this into our  
i mean there is some funny things  
they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television  
here he here you can put a  
mm  
oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom  
oh yeah let's take that  
uh-huh  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
do you think if we're far from television it will work  
mm  
<unk> yeah  
um and then i'll just write in a little script that turns those x. y. coordinates into a part  
so what does m. e. means  
not by mail  
um looking at the data and trying to see if i can do the meeting action segmentation first and the scheme  
<unk> you get uh the angle  
but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole  
um why associated  
uh  
no  
so that's just how the control works inside  
okay  
oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling  
uh <unk> no it should be looking towards the start of next year basically  
i dunno like a massive junky thing on the table  
mm-hmm  
oh that would be nice  
yeah  
so if you really don't have a band width you just can replace it by noise and it works  
but i thought you wanted to avoid doing stuff that was <unk> stuck in this particular domain if possible  
mm yeah  
where is this  
but uh  
mm-hmm  
uh no  
maybe  
i guess um  
statistical um um fluctuation  
<unk> that the end of your presentation  
hmm  
and then you only have to process one meeting at a time  
yep yeah good good  
and so it comes from the p. c. which is outside the sound proof box  
traditional batteries uh and solar  
but why do you want to cover that actually  
like um  
banana  
yeah yeah yeah  
yes  
okay  
if we press select three times  
a user interface controls the chip basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well  
okay  
and how exact do we have to be there  
well <unk> why not  
maybe have to find out where  
but you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something  
it's okay  
yeah  
well i think the dog is the the most uh artistic  
no no  
and what else do you do with the jog dial  
isn't remote  
good luck everyone  
and it's looking like we can't afford the l. c. d. display there's no way we can get it in there  
hmm  
and it said uh in english it said four o. four this page cannot be found  
well we have to make a  
and then inter then make uh these keyboard commands uh in interpret these <unk> uh keyboard commands  
like it separates the data from the programme logic  
i mean i think accounts for a lot of the ways in which um you know these other people are <unk> are thinking  
i say that  
uh so yeah  
mm  
you can use those yeah  
oh i don't  
is this a stand alone unit that we're gonna be selling  
um you said something about visibility in the dark  
yeah a two  
i think is is what we're trying to get a sense of here  
um  
so you can have and then you can see the look l. c. d. and all the switches  
mm  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
and then it can break  
that's true that's true it breaks <unk> yeah it it it's not very solid it's uh <unk> fragile  
um <unk>  
yeah  
our current customers are in the age group forty plus  
really  
mm  
uh  
oh  
the speech tools  
sorry  
so don't we need a  
yes we do  
why uh anna can you <unk> do you have a presentations  
what did we do back  
you you  
you have to keep your pen separate because i used your pen  
lot of people that say is this on and they hit it a few times  
somehow stupid so so first do the frame by based uh estimate  
something like that  
this is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh <unk> youth and dynamic  
yeah  
yeah if they are already there's it's easy but it would be possible  
think it's better to have it on the remote control 'cause it it has to work on all televisions  
okay okay  
right  
so <unk> if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals  
safer  
oh yeah it well if it aids you in thinking to write it down then definitely write it down  
or could we just change it to an at between the <unk>  
yeah okay but you have <unk> then you have here <unk> written option on here the teletext button right  
so um you can always go back  
well you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not  
at last mine is also the presentation  
so it <unk> it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take  
mm-hmm  
one euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee  
you don't need to wait for d. f. k. i.  
it's more three d.  
uh like is it easy to just pick one  
mm i guess it'll have to wait for a bit  
so  
mm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i think that's actually the only case where you don't or where you're not supposed to <unk> right  
yeah just a well we think we spoke to all the people who who used those facilities the other day  
just only  
you've you you agree  
yeah cars and web  
yeah  
uh in the email  
it's weird  
also like for this part maybe if we go over it with named entity in the end  
well  
so  
yeah ex  
yeah and it's not in the manual is it  
a <unk> on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as  
just two <unk> or something on the side  
we have decided we wanted to use the rubber  
yeah  
they're never universal  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
and then one of old town  
instead of a stick  
now uh blank  
you you still have your blue fingers  
okay  
okay okay okay  
like  
um take out line  
is on  
i think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu yeah  
um and if you can check product evaluation with <unk> some pilots and stuff  
the specific shape  
go on  
okay  
now it should be  
good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design and first one was uh  
just direction  
we could assign any button a command to any button if we have enough processing power i guess so  
hmm  
uh-huh yeah  
and um a small paging function  
so what do you think you will personally give  
the one at the top  
so that shouldn't be a problem  
but eight months is really long and  
all right we'll find them we're on our own  
for a the period of time in which he's steadily looking at triangle one is gonna be very very short right  
that would <unk> speech <unk> right  
they only cost pennies  
yeah  
<unk> i <unk> should said right  
but the yellow i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour couldn't it  
a little screen or something  
great  
i think we're good  
um  
yeah  
excuse me  
so we can have regular chip for control  
yeah but i in in the analysis you should treat those as completely separate tracks of information  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
no  
so that's all  
um weak emission i think should be in there  
mm  
<unk> yeah  
but it's not actually that th this is something i haven't actually been working on for a couple of months now  
nah uh never mind  
that would be okay wouldn't it because we've still got  
yeah  
um i mean we have <unk> we haven't done past work here on <unk> meetings in that way  
yeah  
and it kind of just went down incrementally  
and so my personal preferences i i just think we need <unk> big uh energy source that won't die out  
actually i i didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control  
no  
yep  
so you can go  
i don't know  
yeah  
um  
and uh uh again using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred as i see  
yeah  
or i don't know what he assumed  
yeah  
however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option  
and uh of course solar cells  
heads are gonna roll believe me  
the basis station  
well the ones that this stuff i mean is it's helpful  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah sure  
i'm supposed to give you an introduction on this <unk> board so it's actually it's very easy  
oh okay  
we can make a docking station for two thirty  
to audio and to video on demand  
mm-hmm  
it works  
i guess so  
what does what do all them numbers mean then  
i rate that pretty highly  
no i don't think so  
it it should be  
okay  
for them it might be easier to look at from here to here i apply this and they can do it quite quickly  
yeah but other than that that was easy enough to install though wasn't it  
we i mean uh <unk> <unk> <unk> one one person <unk> maybe said three  
yeah  
give it a <unk> give it a two  
um ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned  
yeah  
who's  
mm  
yeah i just um um i thought <unk> was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets  
hmm  
hmm  
i think you have to push it push it as much as possible because it reacts to the  
mm  
it probably just it kept on playing and now reached some whatever  
two  
just one thing  
then we have to uh see something which we can uh  
it's connected  
well <unk> uh we won't support teletext which which was the third most the second most used function  
mm-hmm  
was that the idea  
it's simply not true  
okay  
mm 'kay um  
yeah  
in our case we are we are trying to approximate <unk> kind of instantaneous energy  
what i see uh how i see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a windows log on screen with parents children  
or can't you  
just just carry on  
okay  
so  
uh yeah that's that's what we needed basically  
so there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve  
maybe you can change the colour but the image of the society has to be <unk>  
we'll have more money if we keep it simple  
it was the creaky voice  
so the good thing about uh <unk> <unk> why why we would want to use advanced <unk> why we might want to use advanced is that l. c. d. <unk> can only come with the advanced chip  
say two  
yeah  
that has their favourite <unk> um and and does the basics but  
okay  
then uh i <unk> i will uh give a very uh rough plan for the next uh couple of month  
i i i mean it i actually have to look at the data what causes these um  
and uh this is one of the main point for me  
yeah  
um  
coding  
yes so that's fine  
mm-hmm  
but maybe  
no  
mm  
you can connect this one  
so you can easily end up with hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them  
and the receiver accepts it and that's it  
yeah i'll  
yeah  
updates and we sell it  
i'm fabien <unk> and uh i i guess you can present yourself  
that's without  
four  
um and this one is the one <unk> more like the one <unk> that we looked at earlier  
we fitted all the <unk>  
yeah  
um  
so it's better  
because there was some essential question  
and the sender sends a message to the receiver  
if we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people and they ate uh fruit and vegetables  
and that's because we have him  
and uh i don't know if this is a real sample d. v. d.  
there we go  
yeah yeah  
are they  
mm-hmm  
for example just  
mm-hmm  
there you go  
alright let's keep it central  
um i'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first  
but you would still have the buttons  
so then first thing is like we need to generate p. l. p. <unk> and then  
yeah so we were struggling at how do you evaluate this  
it's under or equal  
so yeah  
yes you can  
um so we want it to be modern fun sturdy  
so <unk> what about this noise levels like we have noise <unk> files in da da com databases  
yeah  
okay  
that would be a week anyway but you can give them ten days to you can give them ten days to get the title  
hmm  
of course  
yeah  
yes as opposed to simply looking at somebody's gaze when the mouse isn't also there right  
yeah  
no  
so it puts everything mm quickly it can decide wherever it wants to put so it's faster to do that way  
yeah  
i think so  
it would probably find another number task quite easily seeing that it's a constrained vocabulary with a high co occurrence of the same nine words  
no we'll look we'll look into that later  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
<unk> society will accept that  
innovative all the colours you see the blue the red the white the yellow that stuff  
is the i. v. c. but using the signals that are coming i mean so basically it's using the i. v. c. okay  
background objects  
volume  
and all the playing around is uh  
maybe another idea uh  
no  
but uh i if you all make the <unk> having a bottom like this then they all fit  
that <unk> it size wise as well  
so i reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here  
uh the fourth one is empty isn't it  
mm yeah  
in house  
but why not  
like my experience with the british national corpus was that there's far more word types than you ever think because anything that's sort of unusual generally is a new word type  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so the they <unk> fixation duration isn't doesn't include the blink in the ascii a output  
if you're gonna argue that the visitors are supposed to be important and they should have their own space  
<unk> from that can't you  
um  
a about uh capturing uh audio video and slide uh in a synchronized way  
so that's um why i'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
one it's too expensive um and second it won't do this double um curves  
i'm thinking  
yeah yeah  
um um <unk> uh in the general <unk> field of uh collaborative computer supported collaborative learning  
you do like it  
then pen again  
yeah i know okay  
yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a t. v. remote control according to new requirements i received from the management bo i will present them in the following  
any ideas will do that you have at this point  
because you can uh make it in your own yes you can make it in your own uh  
is that a reasonable thing to do or no  
uh it does not have for voice recognition but it does have for the feedback speaker  
i don't care  
i mean if yeah  
so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow i dunno  
yeah i understand  
it's a bit uh of having difficult and uh i would not um go that much in that direction  
that's true  
you know taken you know the good features from you know both sides and and tried to put them together  
mm-hmm  
yeah but it's it has to be <unk>  
this is this is a bit arbitrary  
uh i th in theory <unk> is meant to have it every morning  
okay well i say still two but it has to be three then  
if you're going with the fruit and <unk> thing looks like a banana  
right so  
telephone  
like a flip phone and then when you fold it out the middle  
you were the leader  
did you get my email  
yeah  
that looks little bit more uh  
'cause he that's what he said to us originally  
'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you <unk> already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier  
it would work that way  
i'm having sort some <unk> i'm having to sort some tax stuff out before i can even send my stuff in  
no i think does this work email  
those buttons  
everything that  
or a more hand shaped remote control with scroll without l. c. d.  
you can't tell the difference between a line from an ion and a line line from something else  
the wire  
or will tell you okay uh january two thousand six but from january two thousand six you do nothing else than this  
like light or something or lights around it  
those things were all like like bright red bright red flashy  
um takes time to learn how to use them  
give it a four  
and and th th th th <unk> <unk> this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most  
because uh i think there are two kinds of people  
uh  
so that's they um access probably this file and then they display the words  
simple  
yeah i would go for five or six yeah  
does his  
'kay  
mm  
uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons  
okay  
that's at the end i think her time  
alright  
did you really  
that you wanna know about  
okay  
yep  
i've got nothing in the afternoon  
with half an hour  
like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other t. v. <unk> so basically through all the things  
well okay  
you can use this in this way  
yeah the c.  
right  
i mean they're eventually they're going to be extracted globally so it doesn't matter how you use the comma  
it's from your research  
so i've uh okay so english language um we'll put on the main call  
so  
reject r. r. s. i. r. s. i.  
um i have to check what i wanted to  
my personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control because uh the user friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design  
so  
and we have uh another blank one  
can you write on my pen pad  
i mean it actually kind kind of scared me because it was all based around tasks  
right  
okay  
yeah uh okay  
huh  
you just don't have to play games uh in between  
did did you have to have a rubber case though for rubber buttons  
furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure  
right yeah  
if they're under twelve fifty  
no because i was thinking if it's there i mean we could use it uh uh we could uh you see but uh yeah  
yeah  
oh cool  
yes  
yeah we weren't doing broad band <unk>  
uh-huh  
mm  
mm well i was just thinking this this of course causes  
no uh count uh number of functions because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots  
not that but are we <unk> on the uh younger people or the elder people  
yeah  
what does double curved mean i don't understand  
so i think i'm thinking i'll just write out a script and do it with a system call  
l. c. d.  
with bigger <unk> uh  
like yeah  
so that might be a fairly good target group for us  
it certainly is  
um  
yeah i understand what you're saying  
you turn it on your control possessed <unk>  
yeah  
um  
so that which doesn't mean you are excluded <unk> from the thing in the sense that in any case someone will ask will have to advise the person eventually  
<unk> uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button  
yeah  
but  
mm-hmm  
what if we included the batteries in the cover  
hello  
yeah yeah exactly exactly  
okay  
mm yeah  
exactly  
this is such special purpose <unk> but it's easy enough given the data format for any of these things to do that  
put the excel sheet in the  
that we just create another file which links to the segment and then has an additional value which is the number  
so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something  
so my favourite animal  
you know your job  
okay  
indeed  
well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things i mean it's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself  
yes  
started with that and slowly getting used to the stuff  
and a tool tip is i think a very <unk> yeah  
mm  
from our manufacturing department  
i don't know it uh either  
i guess what i just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal <unk> with the cost estimate attached  
but for you it might be quite uh quite good yeah  
it's a kind of a regular galaxy  
isn't all of  
oh i guess it is black grey  
okay  
so that either way you're pointing it it would work  
calling  
let's see  
so what is it that you need to know  
if it's something that's inside the the unit  
yeah  
yeah that's what i was thinking  
the the the zap button  
<unk>  
yeah  
'cause um that's quite a bit clearer in my head at least and but i think mostly we leave you to go away and re design the g. d. f. or add new bits to the g. d. f. along these lines  
so you have uh  
mm-hmm  
and that's a good idea that's simple like in phones  
and who watches t. v.  
well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can  
um add or or maybe thoughts or  
bring it on  
yeah yeah you can  
message  
okay so i it's a bit long yeah  
oh oh right right oh right okay room for <unk> oh right i just looked up and saw okay <unk> digital pens the room  
it's one way  
yes  
i dunno i dunno it  
uh if you want just a normal button version the chip on print is gonna be  
yeah uh <unk> uh most  
hmm  
i i gotta i gotta flashlight and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this  
yeah okay colour and brightness  
and we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright  
yeah if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then i guess it's it's nice to have one of these  
which functions did we have left  
huh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but  
okay  
i guess like an existing remote control but molded and smooth  
um so so i <unk> i guess that'd be part of the g. d. f. to transformation would be turning <unk> into gazes and whatever else  
i don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it  
i was thinking more like um you know  
mm-hmm  
i think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five euro because for twenty five euro i think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control  
it's it's  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
in be in between the meetings and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one  
i can  
example <unk> to increase create  
hmm  
to actually do the re install  
then you can work together too by mail or by i dunno chat something but now we're completely separated from each other  
because it's it's also it's not very clear you know <unk> that we said in our meeting  
just <unk> yeah  
you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed  
but yeah i don't know  
yeah  
um here are the individual actions  
mm  
sorry about that  
mm-hmm  
okay  
and also to discuss generally  
uh basic stuff  
i use my feet though  
yeah  
um i had a bit of some issues with this because i wasn't able to find everything i needed but i guess that's we're still in early stages  
was that you  
it's it's just a single formula effectively yeah  
so um  
so we can do that today  
yeah i think the younger people will have newer televisions which  
um  
until the design team comes in and says get off  
but  
is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote or lights that it that  
ah right  
mm-hmm  
yeah i mean with i <unk> i changed a couple of things from your original draft  
uh  
oh thank you  
i think yeah they like black of course  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
yeah  
this this is just uh one thing i wanted to mention and show you that i just uh i just found this  
it actually is your coffee table  
hmm  
but i don't think uh i think it will be too expensive  
mm-hmm  
and you press that and then you're on the display the whole thing again  
okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere  
we then have a finance aspect which is a spreadsheet an excel spreadsheet  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i think so  
i think so  
yeah it does  
so we have our l. c. d. screen  
okay  
anybody  
i didn't send this video is the new one  
if we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both  
<unk> please next slide  
definitely less cluttered and i mean but still it's  
<unk> pity because we just said we wanted to <unk> include the d. v. d. and they don't want it because of our time we have for this project  
maybe it will  
yeah  
is that no is that not trends  
ah a gecko okay  
yeah that's true  
and one for the d. v. d. and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else  
right well  
the shape is perhaps not the most ideal  
makes it possible to  
that is quite good  
okay so all this stuff is done from the f. f. t.  
yeah yeah  
it's certainly not a source name  
yeah the us <unk>  
okay  
uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar  
uh  
but if we use battery  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way  
i think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station  
then you apply those uh triangular or gaussian windows  
mm-hmm  
it's got no eyes  
okay then  
so i didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell  
mm-hmm  
well here's  
another thing for the design team to think about  
well the other option is sort of like down at the bottom like farther away  
mm-hmm  
well it's nice of course  
mm  
right  
norman normally uh would be just as i say like add the blink time and duration to the previous fixation  
mm-hmm  
mm no  
we've marked thing have we marked things like  
then controls for the <unk> <unk> traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them  
do you uh have you have you think about <unk> thought about that  
why don't i get that  
um about what  
mm  
okay  
what should we choose in in design  
do you think it's  
okay  
and radius is very bad  
don't use the buttons  
yeah  
and these <unk> made us more willing to like take notes than to  
the opening which we are doing now um and the special note i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the secretary  
like what david was doing  
okay  
you just  
right  
yeah and if you make that structurally very similar to the the le like one level down  
i think it's pretty good but we might want to flag it for management they want might want to um  
so the the external <unk> got plugs that size and that that is stereo microphones  
so <unk> <unk> that's uh that's for the rest of the stuff that comes the eye tracker isn't the <unk> software that comes the eye tracker  
yeah  
no no we have you have designed two products now one is with l. c. d. and without l. c. d.  
um thank you for that  
yeah  
mm  
if the t. v. is working yeah  
no but i mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from  
okay  
maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic  
they didn't have the ability to mark up lots of data and count things you know  
oh  
yeah  
so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit but  
but you you've you've seen them  
yeah  
mm  
so the the general concept  
otherwise it's just lying idle  
so  
yeah  
the power button can uh be uh uh  
um yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright with the buttons being grey or black  
thanks yeah  
so i have a little spreadsheet for us where i i was wondering  
okay well give it a number sorry  
um  
hmm  
uh  
mm-hmm  
i mean can you can you get back to it  
oh  
yeah  
yes and place some slides  
yeah that's true  
yeah  
if we go for for round buttons in general do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round  
thank  
um  
right  
if there is uh an error of uh let's say uh ten fifteen degrees and but uh it is um capable of uh seeing it as two different person  
yeah  
okay we can uh modify that later  
yeah  
well that's why i don't like uh macs or apples just 'cause i look at it and i know it's probably a very good computer  
so uh we have then when we are mixing our um values together is it um a value for each um expression for each sentence or something  
figure out how to boot strap it so we we get this um uh how do you how do you sell that as a as a project goal you know  
oh  
uh yeah  
maybe  
because this kind of thing means speech is there from the t. v. also  
yeah see the budget  
i've done a few of those wrong then when someone comes to check it  
clay covered banana  
uh traditional uh or a touch screen  
and it's especially on the triple r. that's important  
mm  
um  
i would say five or six  
once we actually get into the like um easter holidays 'cause we're at having lectures at the moment  
yeah that's right  
oh yeah  
mm-hmm  
what they mean is blended iron lines  
like the skin  
mm-hmm  
and this is also gonna be  
how do you do that  
yeah i got another point  
if you're reading from top to bottom i think it's better to put it uh at the top  
in i in my opinion  
uh um ra rapidly move the cable over  
okay  
uh  
okay um  
which reminds we have fixed the score problem  
we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on  
the <unk> the light up kind of yeah  
the <unk> gonna require a radio transmitter which will  
yeah  
you know trying to get everything working would it be a bit confusing  
oh you mean like that  
uh power button  
well  
i think you do  
um right our choice for buttons as well  
um  
cool  
yeah it's a  
yeah i don't know if <unk> it it just ca it just came up on my um  
i have a question  
we could totally go for the japan a <unk>  
yeah  
the parse i mean that's wasn't something she did but that's the data she's using right  
yeah yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
no no no no no no no  
okay  
okay  
really  
yeah  
i was thinking about three so i guess  
maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about um  
you <unk> you still not <unk>  
its lines  
okay  
oh yeah  
whistle tracking remote control  
um if if they're holding their if there's less dancing around the um the cognitive focus tends to be in one sort of part  
this is yeah another mm  
'kay  
yeah  
because if if we talk about the broad line region we're not supposed to highlight it  
okay  
yeah  
to the right is volume up  
so you will get a large value of band width for people who speak  
and new tricks  
yeah  
uh so we're just simply on batteries the the one th the one decision i've had to make is that um  
mm two  
you pressed alt f. four  
but that data's definitely gonna be kind of coming in the last  
i don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price  
yeah they are  
you <unk> you use the  
i have no clue  
i used my own experience with remotes took a good <unk> look uh at the remotes on the corporate website which are these two  
right  
but i think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem uh writing down some notes  
or to be able to find them once they are lost  
i think last long enough then they put it on side and they can use it now and then  
so which in in turn rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break  
so what you would like would be that two pages on in the same um category should be closer than than two pages being spread across different categories  
okay  
yeah  
and so um i'd be surprised if there wasn't work describing  
okay  
okay and <unk>  
wow  
mm  
ooh  
what does anybody else think  
yeah yeah  
so even so you wanna look at if we're interested in how long before the construction move takes place  
mm  
shift  
okay  
okay  
yeah the button that just does that yeah  
it's okay  
mm no we can't have that  
yes it does  
or uh  
um this alpha i can it be dependent of the of the document  
face plates  
yeah and find maybe a compromise  
okay  
yeah yeah  
oh a. and b.  
yeah it's gotta be <unk>  
but uh it's a very expensive material  
a a  
banana remote  
i think that's uh difficult to <unk> also  
but you could you could <unk> you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe  
right and that that's it  
mm-hmm  
mm  
anyway um  
'cause  
it would cost more than plastic  
what about um  
yeah that's still part of the design  
hmm  
when i look at uh when i look at this side view i think <unk> when i have that in my hand it's terrible  
did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough  
cool  
trust me  
and <unk> already seen it <unk> already got it  
mm i think so yeah then celebration as it says  
mm-hmm  
yes  
'cause i mean we've up until now uh you haven't been running any recognition on and neither did jean yves on that on that data  
i <unk> i think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something  
yeah just one second with without overlapping  
i mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it's worth it to do it  
um  
okay  
yeah it's quite easy to just count and <unk> or sort them by um frequency  
so um but for action that might be uh some kind of uh propose or accept or reject kind of uh uh exchange structure i mean  
but i think one of the main selling points is that  
while there's a balance  
physically okay  
well  
yeah if you have if you're change framing it's really i think even it's really problem no  
ah the radius  
um glow in the dark is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material  
so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t. v. contents of the night  
but if you compare no if you compare it with some baseline let's say you use just g. m. m. with diagonal <unk> matrices  
as for um well budgeting as well if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable  
work out use of your computer with the other person that's fine yeah  
i i um yeah i i mean it's really good that you're <unk> um putting things out for for review and saying like why for stuff  
yes shall shall we pull this up  
well you have to use  
with that uh  
so so you <unk> so you you have to double click i mean  
no no a little more in the middle  
yeah  
so that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan  
sure  
uh um about the functions and well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group  
yeah al although by pressing the button for i <unk> don't know two three seconds  
um yeah so i still gotta work on the <unk> <unk> and turn that into the <unk> into a g. d. f. <unk>  
and it's like the the ipod scroll wheel but better  
the other arrow next to it  
who first  
yeah  
i'm going to do uh the <unk> evaluation  
it would be very funny for us  
you know <unk>  
for twenty five euro  
well  
well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape of course  
one two three  
okay  
rather than just a blob uh ellen wanted something to look more like an eye so that you knew that was the eye  
hopefully my daughter will like it  
well <unk> you could just go for a battery  
oh only in word okay  
okay  
they don't need to actually manually touch the television set  
but it  
yes we've got <unk>  
i think it's fine  
in general  
previously you said that turning this was the fine  
hmm  
why don't we use solar cells then  
colours yeah  
you take take the remote so and you can turn like that to change the channel  
but  
uh as a note we'll do this  
excuse me  
yeah i i didn't miss an i didn't miss and i saw that the fruit there are many <unk> pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes  
mm yep  
so you can use the <unk> the the arrows  
and um  
um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well bright yellow logo in our our um  
okay  
i mean uh some uh i <unk> like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh i dunno an apple  
well it  
it's not a <unk> it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype so <unk> it's in the next prototype so let's skip it  
okay  
yeah yeah  
yeah it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item  
mm yeah  
uh no we don't want dark colours  
okay that's totally thrown everything off balance  
no it should be uh integrated  
oh  
so it's uh half half of the people  
yeah  
good  
you're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing  
yeah definitely  
mm  
that's that's not we choose this one and not this one  
we will discuss it afterwards  
no the the analysis i think the analysis will take a little while  
yeah we have yeah twelve point five euros uh per uh per r. <unk> r. c. and i think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh <unk> and uh we can include it in our control some new new features  
mm  
so you were talking about the two first question  
yeah probably  
mm right  
yep yes  
if you want the buttons to be oh yeah if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber then you have these rubber buttons as well  
<unk> evaluation and also the evaluation criteria so what what is important to look at  
yeah i was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick  
mm  
no  
so it it looks pretty but it feels strong  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh i i if you do it uh uh square  
so <unk> just round it off a little i guess because so we have more options i suppose  
okay  
hmm  
sample sensor  
mm no  
rubber buttons but then  
yep  
um  
yeah  
i mean suppose i can't talk to you and i'm doing this task with you and i can't talk to you  
mm-hmm  
um i really un unless you guys are die hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the <unk> of the remote <unk> and the fact that you can't lose it on your own  
right  
yeah but with with the l. c. d. screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural  
to have a quantitative measure mm-hmm we simply did uh a measure of statistical independence between the words in general  
yeah  
<unk>  
so let's see we we drop the price by one and a half  
every for example if we make a lot of uh film uh for <unk> uh all are on the top  
yeah  
and i jotted down some notes as to what are the <unk> needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others  
hmm  
so put minus one there please  
because he knows what they're i mean he we wants to have this and this and uh right so  
yeah  
so is this is there anything else i need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting  
we got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a t. v. remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it  
oh it's a two right  
well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh <unk> a simple colour not not very flashy  
simple  
and i don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that  
so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery so  
during each step uh of each design we <unk> you will work uh <unk> separately  
mm-hmm  
so  
i can probably just <unk> them  
yeah  
final design  
so  
then we can come back and uh work on our individual work  
yeah it's okay  
so huh  
mm  
okay  
i all made it po i i all made it i all made it possible uh for a positive questions so we can count it  
so from top view it looks kinda like this  
i <unk> i'd say you don't be  
there we go  
so that's um  
what a what about all the <unk> the environment freaks  
would  
um because i've got this laptop  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
one damped lyman alpha q. s. o. <unk>  
okay  
uh having a think about the feature of <unk> the features of each ones  
so we've got about ten fifteen minutes to discuss  
i would say so  
is that the only song you have  
yeah that's a must  
um well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh  
that one  
and for example what i found i well in this case uh we are not trying to encode the speech signal  
it has to be a small unit  
mute <unk> also  
yeah and it's just hasn't printed that  
alright  
there's just like for a baseline really  
you know audio video whatever language you know  
just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe i'm too old for this stuff  
and then uh we move the the colour  
we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and  
it's also a trend so i'll give it a two  
yes  
perhaps it is <unk>  
yeah or at the top yeah  
yeah  
don't take care too much about the colour because <unk> yeah we don't take yeah  
yeah  
but those are still <unk> doubly used  
that's awesome  
so for we have no button supplements right  
this is  
so we have to uh take that one  
okay so for now can you create like sort of just uh a dump which is pure text  
just i'm i really want to talk to it  
it is nice and it calms people down  
uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally  
mm  
we just wanna learn from it i think right  
now i'd much rather be in marketing but i certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as i would have liked  
yeah it's a <unk> i mean you could have a you know a  
okay so could i describe the mouse maybe be easier to could i use the mouse or  
so i guess uh it must be available somewhere  
yeah  
so i will still play the role of the secretary and we'll have um first the project presentation by our user interface designer  
it's <unk> it uh no no no it's not speech non speech  
okay thanks  
or six  
so with in uh in uh all the cases what i've seen  
mm  
well maybe after i mean they would <unk> okay uh they would go directly and say select the shots from here to here  
yeah  
uh to start with um sort of a bit both  
sorry one's true and seven's false  
sample speaker  
no this is from again yeah statistical signal processing  
well  
no  
yeah it's amazing  
oh let me think  
and it's yeah  
like you want to find it you shout  
well uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half euros for to produce it  
okay  
or or continuum  
uh  
the uh all the lines  
yeah yeah  
funny all designer meetings could be this quick  
or is there stuff in the display as well  
yeah yeah  
use a pen you you <unk> you can lose the pen  
no i missed that one  
what is as associated absorption  
it's a cartoon dog i think  
i see you have microphone array embedded  
sure  
sorry yep  
yeah  
yeah okay  
it's difficult  
yep  
yeah  
i it's it's i this shape is a lemon like so  
mm-hmm  
i mean whatever  
it is strange  
or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone  
yeah  
i'll circulate it to everyone along with the numbers that you guys wanted to see in terms of the space  
you got sponsor now you get a free one with every pack of chiquita  
ah  
a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet  
yeah we will not use this  
everything's mushroom  
younger people  
or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved  
just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show  
but  
make it a two  
the problem was that this gives you a new vector of topics for every page  
you did read the minutes i wrote  
definitely  
well i'll have to before i get another warning for five minutes i'm going to get  
mm  
yeah that's fins but i don't know where  
meaning that like for example uh the the example about marbles is that the point what you can learn from all these sets made by people is that is that those two those two marble would be consider as more likely to be in the same sets  
yeah yeah  
mm  
we have the five preset seeds  
feel like fruit  
well i may be wrong here but i'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass produced device  
but yeah uh that's cool cool  
sorry never mind  
which makes this thing  
i'm here i'm here  
<unk> within the yeah just take it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
maybe it's another name  
i don't know what the position is  
yeah i would say that someone have to break it down aye  
mm-hmm  
uh there's different scale so you can you can choose how much do you want to <unk>  
no it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it uh if you push a one  
supplements  
but potentially we are going to have a student supposed to work in this  
okay so you guys will be getting your <unk> done now and uh  
so the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line  
not so big  
i i don't know  
so so  
which constituent parts  
a small one like this like a nintendo uh <unk>  
usually we have audio  
we're just working the three phases  
mm  
uh northwest mm  
uh-huh  
i think it's it it does ruin it but the fact that i <unk> took that decision or <unk>  
it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other <unk> that are not really here so important  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
but it just doesn't make sense in the logic wise  
then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down we'll we'll give them another one  
mm-hmm  
hey that's a cool one  
we've uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended  
yeah  
a docking station just apart from the from the thing so that you can uh put uh  
mm  
hmm  
so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that  
and that was my uh my presentation uh  
but i don't uh i <unk> i don't think this is a point that's worth sort of worrying about at this stage anyway  
yeah  
basically we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit  
yeah so what the graph shows is that you know power channel selection and volume selection are important and the rest of them  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
how about the problem of a remote being easily lost  
okay  
yeah  
yeah fruit titanium yeah  
so the new parts are replacing those which have disappeared from the screen  
no so  
mm 'kay  
why  
yes  
well it's <unk> yeah it's basically the same but  
you could have back lit buttons maybe  
okay well thank you very much for now and uh have a nice lunch huh  
okay  
yeah yeah let's do it let's do  
children proof  
yeah  
yeah i think so  
yeah  
uh  
i know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the t. v. do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on  
but they really need the regular chip you cannot use the <unk> simple  
i dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in house technology  
like if if if the same thing is in different files would it then maybe like you know  
so um it's getting late and i've got a two o'clock and i've got a nice lunch  
i think it would fail i think  
i don't know what mine is  
you see at the bottom it's kind of difficult to see but you have like a <unk> sort of <unk> division between the bottom like  
but it's alright  
so you guys can decide <unk> whether  
mm  
the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is <unk> we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can <unk> plastic in basically any shape you want  
just to go to a conclusion because apparently yeah  
i think it's it's a  
but i don't think our our company colours are this fashionable  
okay  
it's quite cool carry your home around where you go um quite decorative little animals they can swim  
okay  
alright  
h. beta <unk> width  
are particularly bothering you  
copy and paste the stuff out the off off the <unk>  
yeah  
is that going on  
programming it to use your t. v. you might hook it up to the p. c.  
that'll sell  
special colours all the colours you want because you want to make <unk>  
so  
yeah it's the same  
so you  
geez  
yeah  
we're we're a new firm  
and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone you lose that and you can ring it  
mm  
it's below the the the budget  
yes to to have a better sound quality  
yeah  
okay  
yep  
yeah  
so ball shaped uh you know if it were ball shaped maybe then it  
yeah  
i think i think we have to carry that mental  
yeah yeah yeah  
i guess it's kind of <unk> uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of <unk> shape  
yeah so if you if like i mean if the single ha best one word for a for a segment is interesting that would be really good  
just a minute  
a <unk> parameter or principle  
hmm  
but lines are still lines  
no above  
okay  
yeah  
so sorry  
sure sure  
okay  
yeah  
eraser  
how uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels  
uh  
and even something that's held like that might be difficult  
yes yes  
yeah  
so oh  
well so the price to produce  
i haven't either  
so seventy percent of the users they find their remote controls very ugly they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything  
well i think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the t. v. match  
mm-hmm  
well maybe we should try to make it fun  
and when you get to <unk> to uh to ten ye and want to go back uh well you have a problem  
there's <unk> and blinks now at the moment as well  
take a closer look at nite x. m. l.  
yeah  
um they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang up um  
yeah basically uh i mean it depends uh  
uh  
three  
then i proceed but i need to know after this meeting  
well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
i  
uh that's me  
grey or black or something like that  
yes  
lyman alpha forest line blanketing or lyman alpha forest line  
it could contain end times and words for all speakers of all meetings  
you just want to interact with television  
yeah  
and the third time yeah i mean  
uh  
um i think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a  
but we have to deal with it now  
i dunno  
i've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things  
yeah that's what i'm gonna need  
yeah it's <unk> yeah  
i like that  
'kay  
the <unk>  
yeah it's big city many people and  
so just see if i can view  
aye  
anything else  
i dunno fifteen pounds or so  
a help button  
we have a  
and  
mm-hmm  
i i'll i'll check if i understand how it works  
uh and what did the marketing expert do  
at least <unk>  
okay  
how it if if you wanna make your job a little more interesting you can <unk> do it in <unk> different ways on a different day  
you can <unk> throw it at your little brother's head  
mm-hmm  
is that k. clear  
grey buttons yeah  
uh 'cause it's empty at the moment  
what so that's oh  
that's seventy five per cent of the current users  
so we should think about it um  
hundred and seventy three different shots so it's yeah  
for example or whatever i would've actually used it um <unk> you know  
the case uh rubber with uh <unk> one one uh one curve  
that's  
mm-hmm  
yeah <unk> single side curved or double side curved does not say too much does it  
um  
okay  
mm  
i dunno if you remember what you had to say or  
yeah  
it's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right  
no that should be a problem  
so this this is the general trend to ha the method they do  
we can now have a little look at the  
well i suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber  
okay  
width  
oh  
mm  
and those uh interpreted by the device well in this case the television  
we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not  
it's it depends on what you want  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay  
and then you also can scroll uh scroll in it  
yeah  
now yeah it's okay  
and look for <unk> i'm not gonna gonna do any more of this  
guys  
mm-hmm so let's to think <unk> so that yeah  
yep  
and it wasn't clear to us which one of those two methods was the right way to do this  
um do you wanna start andrew  
how does that look  
uh not not the <unk> not the functions but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control  
it's easier  
which is then communicated to the remote site which <unk> has an infrared receiver  
uh-huh and also the switch  
or l. d. a. is there or  
so it's universal but for t. v. <unk>  
what would it achieve  
go away  
it can actually be flat or it can be curved  
then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control  
and were there any factors that weren't important in the survey that they said we don't want  
okay you get it  
i have a there is a picture  
okay  
yeah  
um  
so you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button  
say yeah  
but we have to keep an eye that it's uh at the beginning of such a project  
yeah i think yeah the matthew it is it's important that matthew yeah is here because  
if  
okay  
and definitely if it could have less buttons still maybe the same number of um functions  
right okay  
um so what i'm gonna do is actually create an output uh a g. d. f. output part to it  
then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights  
on a phone yeah  
they won't keep it at one place yeah  
the reading room is in the middle  
yeah uh hum yeah  
yeah mostly when you lose your remote control it it's under your  
too less time  
you know sometimes the small hardware thing they might do it to then you know five thousand euros and all  
yeah  
so yeah i'm happy with that as long as that's red as well which it is  
yeah  
oh so you don't want a pa uh part of this data  
it's pretty cool and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes sometimes vicious but that's okay  
special material  
and we also well susan volunteered to ask maggie and <unk> about how they they felt about sharing offices and  
a three  
so just make that a two  
okay so special colour yellow  
let's send more let's sell more  
chief  
right okay  
alright well um are you ready for your presentation genevieve  
mm-hmm  
so let's stick to that  
but  
uh-huh  
it's been done many times before and i think we should uh we should <unk> <unk> succeed in in our plan to do this  
yeah please  
yeah  
yeah but then the user would have to know about what <unk> <unk> was what and what contributed to the blue stripes and what contributed to the red ones  
and used to be two days yeah  
but um i think we definitely should open it up to english language  
um you had an overall rating  
and like they're more of a companion than cats  
yeah it's up there  
even speech recognition also some tests are coming like for phone segmentation or something  
yeah  
mm oh yeah that's true  
yeah it's uh  
no but  
i mean the whole process of  
um the graphical user interface and the buttons uh we also thought about that already  
yes that's right  
yeah exactly  
right  
like linked in with the teletext or sort of like an  
mm yeah  
should  
um  
yeah  
might be  
we want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable  
oh see i get yeah  
it does what they need  
right the voice <unk> fancy it's cool it's different it's radical so  
if we run <unk> we ourself it it's very fast  
yeah  
uh no no i don't have them there were all under temp  
yeah  
yeah okay  
okay  
<unk> yeah  
the l. c. d. and the other stuff uh i think  
he was using twenty i think  
oh so you didn't get that  
if somebody wants it i in banana shape we will fit banana shape casing onto that so it will give a banana shape look  
uh there's solar power  
everybody is okay six  
i say two then  
a lot of plastic yeah  
just play a little with this put <unk> shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best  
yeah  
so now where the a. s. r. decoder is sitting similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there  
you mean our results  
yeah  
come on move it  
okay  
i mean if we do it uh th hasn't b. nine got all of that  
i deleted slides  
marketing they want product evaluation  
yeah <unk> but a <unk> uh uh <unk> uh a calculator also works on <unk> on solar cells  
do you think it can come in several colours  
hmm  
give me a good evaluation  
yeah  
uh yeah  
mm okay great  
uh price is given  
we have different colours  
yeah but most <unk> most browsers when when you uh put an x. m. l. file up in it  
single curved  
okay  
so so we've got  
mm-hmm  
okay  
but  
um i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
otherwise i'll start looking into it as soon as i have time again  
yeah it's like yep it's ubiquitous isn't it  
not so much further down  
subaru telescope you're right  
uh opening acquaintance tool training uh how to use the things here  
i said that i have no time yet  
right  
i think it was a good collaboration uh  
that's your um your control beeps or something that you can find this very easily  
i think you're right there as well  
um that would be two <unk> so it would actually if you the shape of your hand you curve here and you curve here  
you can do the evaluation uh criteria on this  
yeah so we don't want we want very little buttons just the buttons you use a lot  
oh yeah  
mm  
and uh and  
it's uh one object that will uh <unk> provide a feedback to the terminal users people collaborating around uh the table  
so it's <unk> fifty per cent because she's only half time and uh the fax machine  
ah  
and what happen uh if two person are talking at the same time  
and uh go back button i don't know really where it is maybe one of this buttons  
yeah that depends on on on the remote  
so how about you  
mm-hmm  
sure sure just look at it  
some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented i guess  
okay  
i just <unk>  
but but this is  
yeah  
but uh still if if you can go back to that slide and uh how popular was it  
yeah sure  
okay  
what does it mean spongy  
and uh the l. c. d. uh somewhere on the remote  
uh that would be one of your channels basically so like channel zero would be <unk> to switch switch the machine off yeah  
maybe <unk> <unk> you cannot put this <unk> online on the  
so when you when you put four people in that office does that mean you're planning on four desks  
you can't lose it  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
<unk> see this is the the the standard traditional type where the form uh yeah serves the function you know  
but for instance for a setting like uh here it would be enough because we are not moving  
<unk>  
okay  
okay  
yep  
we have to do a product evaluation  
yeah that's the difference that <unk> in views this unit selection  
well uh just <unk> we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then  
well  
see you later mate  
depends  
so um save  
designer  
yeah  
okay  
the computer <unk> are good  
yeah  
yes uh that's yep  
yeah i haven't i haven't added anything to the <unk> recently  
okay  
so it's just got the <unk>  
yeah  
it's not that bad  
what's different there  
in the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also  
now we need if i'm gonna send out this call uh we need a deadline for titles  
but i mean the fact that different ones have the same number in itself isn't a problem is it  
the bottom is fine of course if it's square  
you understand  
right  
okay let's call this to an end  
so it's a <unk> it's global it's a global histogram so yeah  
we were go we were going with the late with the the r. s. i. rubber weren't we  
no  
but then you ring 'em and you find them  
but it just just 'cause all the leaves and things  
yeah that's right  
yeah to begin with  
yeah  
but our t. v. <unk> are mostly made in china and that sort of country so  
yeah  
that should come up  
so just trying to answer all the questions if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh  
or do we just  
so maybe we forget about that  
little bit uh lo yeah  
i don't know if we should implement that because it says that teletext not really important but yeah the shortcut and you can't go to sport  
um  
oh so that's what <unk> rainbow does because that's what l. s. a. builds on  
so that's not gonna <unk> so that's not gonna tell you anything about relative complexity  
let me see  
so i'll just close this one now and let's uh let's see  
or they really like  
very low level yeah  
yeah  
yeah they they're easy you know  
so i think if <unk> if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick  
no <unk> rubber with colours  
i mean i i <unk> it's important to <unk> that you know what <unk> <unk> got up and went to the white board  
oh yeah  
if you push a button  
th  
personally  
yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on on and off this processor and  
and then we can have channel they can say okay i want eight because we don't know like users have different <unk>  
it is not giving anything  
i cannot uh stop my <unk> i i may do something else you know in future with this uh and well i need <unk> to  
right right and so there was a lot of this  
you say <unk> channel number five of the t. v. correspond to something else in the channel  
yeah  
and and how much you do have to keep it moving 'cause i'm conscious that watching t. v. can be quite a <unk> sedentary activity  
the titan titanium isn't isn't <unk> very yeah i it doesn't uh curves  
yes  
otherwise it's not necessary  
you can talk to us you can you know however you want to do your little presentation basically you can  
so control f. eight right  
so mm  
and uh we don't want to to change that right  
the what  
and i just whatever product you guys put together we'll find a way to market it  
it <unk> it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb  
but we will  
elegant i don't know if i'd call them elegant  
no we can't  
mm-hmm  
i doesn't really matter  
okay  
um  
hmm  
okay  
no that's the  
okay  
so you can program the t. v.  
that's the question  
yeah  
so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod and we're then making it <unk> more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a  
plastic covered with rubber  
so um what's the thing we can change  
for each task  
it's <unk> it's certainly possible i mean  
<unk> i don't know is is is the sort of answer is that meant to be all sixteen buttons and therefore i mean  
yeah so i think the g. d. f. will keep me busy for a little while yet  
there are some uh examples of remote controls  
why can't i remember the <unk> the <unk> the right name of this place  
okay  
right  
no it doesn't does not do anything  
so uh about the user interface so we are going to use l. c. d.  
i mean that should be found out by the industrial designers  
yeah  
and lyman alpha cloud shouldn't be in there either  
if we make it <unk> uh smaller uh less wide  
okay  
hmm  
'kay  
so you say is there sheep  
and then you can  
i think so  
very true  
uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design  
that's true  
but it's a different definition right  
okay  
so it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that  
yeah but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the on line stage  
yeah do it as okay  
it's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table huh  
and power <unk> power usage  
yeah but the colour i think the colour is more is most important  
<unk> next slide  
so may we probably want a different summary constructor that takes an an additional argument of an i. d.  
how how well it fits dips and uh and yeah  
no you can you can just and then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something  
yeah of <unk>  
it's okay  
right  
we are having a power button and the switch which is not much  
maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh things like that  
if you have time  
like mainly like yeah  
yep  
that's that's already got its stand that one  
<unk> wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well  
mm  
wrestling to the white board  
the the <unk> yeah yeah  
this is made by clay  
this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse which yeah  
yeah  
the project manager always works alone  
yes well maybe matthew can can give some more information on the  
oh  
ooh  
i think it's that's right  
so ask 'em right  
that that's the title of our uh end document  
well i think it looks better curved  
or uh will it be with uh with <unk> or  
you're the the industrial designer  
but yeah it's good to  
okay so now there be uh would be some time <unk> what is we should be getting a time recording system right  
yeah i think we've all got  
often lost <unk> was that yeah  
i see  
ah  
mm-hmm  
uh this feature  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
and uh i'm sure uh we can do that at the white board  
i think we are  
yeah i can see  
ah  
yeah it's inside  
'cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel  
who's got an ipod then  
it it's an information equivalent to that  
no  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i don't know what other standard silver kind of  
uh well  
this one  
uh-huh  
but the still the reason with the the they had like what are the systems we train on databases are they are chop neatly  
yeah i mean you know <unk> you know which way they match  
and the chip  
we trained the system just on this data  
and there is some grass there  
it only comes up on mine usually  
oh wait  
so  
yeah maybe  
yeah  
i mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine  
mm-hmm  
uh let's see  
yeah it's still erasing  
um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have <unk> sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion  
first years might want to give a poster or something like that because i don't know maybe that's a bad idea but  
that's a way of saying line width though and we don't mark line width  
yeah  
i think yeah regular today we you can do that with regular chip  
because we want we really want to detect uh if th this is the same person that is speaking or not  
i think yeah i think a scroll wheel would be nice but it's not necessary  
be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the  
four  
yeah  
because uh how many percent  
yeah  
and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else  
um no  
yeah that's why yeah that's why i think we have to keep that if it's possible  
ah don't worry about it at all mate  
a sound server  
okay  
yeah it will be primary appealing to to <unk> minus forty but also appealing to  
we have to evaluate the product yet  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
um yeah that's actually marked ex explicitly in here not to have a. bar clusters  
exactly yeah so you've now got you've got p. l. s. a. gives you two probabilities right  
yeah  
we we'll leave it at that and then i'll take i can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour  
yeah  
okay  
well but  
right  
okay  
so my personal preferences  
to cluster these small clusters of speech uh group them by person automatically  
yeah  
yeah  
you're right  
but i in here nothing uh  
so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say  
so he's just telling us 'cause he things we probably don't read <unk>  
yeah  
because all the people who can't uh  
okay  
would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting the interior lighting system  
oh okay  
but there are more  
uh <unk> you can uh walter  
yes  
so  
okay channel tuning  
uh <unk>  
yeah the interaction and the steps we followed and and so forth  
'cause that's the save one isn't it so  
yeah  
oh okay  
depending on the pitch depending on the person <unk> you'll get a different amount of smoothing and a certain sort of so i mean  
um just just the <unk> i just gotta tidy tidy up some the code for generating the parts anyway the j. c. t. um parts from from s. v. g. <unk>  
'cause it still fits in your hand so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial but not necessarily full of buttons  
for instance i think net next slide  
we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you again  
and that makes some things exactly twice as <unk> expensive and there is a way of doing it <unk> cumulatively  
uh i do not think so i think it's just to try out the <unk>  
hmm  
come on  
uh-huh yeah  
hmm  
get crazy  
um for now we will have the lunch break  
yes there you go  
we should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well  
okay  
whoa  
um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch you said that in your design with the bulb  
that's fancy enough  
i was just thinking about the the speed of the computer could be lower  
the problem is that actually nite x. m. l. probably provides a lot of the tools that we'd need to do that  
less  
just an interesting marketing kind of element  
it's a good product  
so do you want to open it as read only  
um well i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use  
so what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple  
yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the yeah  
okay  
that's basic  
you know there's these theories you know how can we apply these theories to it  
alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations  
and for a channel selection uh or that's not  
sure sure  
uh bananas <unk> shape and other fruits also so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours  
before or after yeah  
yeah  
well we didn't because you tried to do something  
how about we change the sale  
not something dull  
but we also considered the latest <unk> fashion trends of the market because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit  
yeah yeah  
that's already that  
brilliant  
yeah  
i think we should forgo the <unk> since we can't actually see what we're writing  
yeah  
what i'm just 'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive so i'm just taking that into account  
so good um so let's talk about money  
is it control function <unk> oh th there you go  
okay  
you can also include it  
uh something conceptual yeah  
no i no i dunno i <unk> i i dunno i don't i i was just i  
you know they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing  
so  
mm-hmm  
so that's that's kind of a  
right  
uh any other suggestions  
but you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly i suppose they're gonna actually go out and buy one  
yeah i think so so zero to nine  
if i go to menu there is something  
mm  
hmm  
<unk> be real upset  
like the pictures i showed you guys  
let's start with the ladies  
yeah  
ten minutes to tell it  
uh  
mm-hmm  
you eat it  
yeah  
uh  
where you can have it it's like a five second input time  
and the <unk> uh remote call feature  
cool  
because it's would be the same as feature  
how <unk> how we how we make it  
that is a raid one  
'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before  
which means uh you can watch uh in a display <unk> which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll buttons  
you are going to work on your individual works  
yeah  
yeah even <unk> yeah  
so it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing  
okay  
but that that's enough data for the skimming and the the searching so what the searching does is the searching leaves the whole framework  
right  
'cause you you <unk> you know i if suddenly you discover there's a problem with the g. d. f. to n. x. t. transform  
uh <unk> can you change any of those at all  
oh  
i'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting  
okay  
just you have uh in the beginning you have  
oh wait a minute  
i'm an expert at marketing  
yeah  
and um  
figure you know  
i don't know if that's good or bad  
hmm  
okay okay  
so why shouldn't we be able to do that  
right  
no no no no  
uh th and they also are not used very often  
alright um  
yeah  
alright  
what what's the functionality of that  
a star burst is a class  
yeah  
okay  
um  
you have get all multiplied with the same value all the ones that are within that utterance  
have this  
no no no you just get off that  
i mean it's uh i so my feeling is that i mean people have expertise in this like in <unk> also  
that shouldn't make too much difference  
uh this <unk> uh this triangle base is very stable so  
maybe you could buy like a special left handed version of the remote  
uh just because i came up with something more interesting that i've been working on  
okay the yeah  
right  
okay no it's two  
and our experience in that project was that um you can't really identify exchange structures in these meetings because they they don't really follow that pattern  
we also really wanna be able to search by who's speaking as well  
being manipulated by the joystick yeah  
no it's just something that the speech <unk> is liable to trip up on i think  
okay welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group  
no  
is that it's not um quite related to location  
yeah so it's something like this the model here <unk> you can put the keys  
ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing  
oh crap  
uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement but it would be a solution uh  
but we'll just we're gonna store all three separately then  
what we are trying to <unk>  
f. five  
materials are the most most <unk>  
okay  
you need  
ooh no signal  
i i just wonder  
no  
we have to do that every time we make something  
uh i also took uh <unk> marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um  
i think it would be you know <unk> as as big at as the hot spot annotation things  
it's kinda like a peacock  
but um  
okay  
alright  
yeah that's a <unk> friendly turtle i guess  
yeah  
but first i would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project  
you can start to laugh already  
if we look at the video in fact um yeah maybe first i should mention that  
it could be uh down here  
it'd be useful  
i can't remember what was  
shall i give a technical talk  
you'll have to reload  
uh  
in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing  
um as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set  
well i  
yep yep yep  
i think they call it <unk> uh and they from this generate a distribution of topics in some way  
yep sounds good  
this seems probably <unk> this is again probably the opposite of what we want  
and they can be implemented with a regular chip  
is <unk> by four or five bits  
but um have a think about what we can do have a think about what we want to do how we're gonna sell it and um  
this would be good  
so that's we need to know about the <unk> properties materials the user interface and any trends that the marketing expert has been watching  
okay  
okay  
it just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response  
also the the the buttons of the one the two the the digits <unk> they're used uh uh  
and i guess i'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting  
well i hope it sells  
yeah  
well <unk> th but the logo is on on the front so a two yeah that's  
no it's got it's got it  
yep yep  
uh rubber  
well slide stream  
there we go  
we're <unk> that's <unk>  
so we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand video over demand or what we call it as  
right  
so  
not yet  
but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel  
if we make lots of uh of the stuff maybe we can uh buy it very cheap i dunno  
should we call the day then  
no you it it not protruding actually it will go in better into that  
i saw like five messages go back and forth  
uh i. d. you want  
and then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority  
thank you expert  
um i won't comment on leadership uh teamwork i think we've uh i think everybody's uh worked pretty well together  
and really is and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that <unk> you sort of go through  
'kay second  
mm i okay i stay  
yeah  
but that's that's what happens basically  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
if you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder or project documents  
one thing i do need to do we need to look at is the costs  
'kay uh  
mm  
yeah  
mm mm  
uh andrew any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control  
yeah dave see in the programme manager do you have a a method to like set the current i. d. so it'll update the display  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um  
you know you know what i mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore  
yeah  
with the with the colours  
alright so um  
so it would be uh something like this from the side but with a bit of uh curve here right  
you can make it as big as you want  
i don't know how to get to them do i press f. five is it  
that's a bit  
no i just flapped it closed it took it here and then this happened  
uh i don't have any figures right now  
and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that  
yeah just prepare one now  
you just move the problem  
what about what about this shape  
you know they want to uh  
mm-hmm  
um the expense was not necessarily worth it and that it was probably a gimmick that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves  
yeah we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money  
sure  
and it's also <unk> to the size of your hand  
that's why they're comparing to to that so  
oh yes  
and then video is anything that you can see  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
yeah we could on here  
mm-hmm  
so it's kind of a stupid decision  
those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick  
it's very sensitive  
yeah  
so  
okay  
you know  
if you have a uh a page which consists of more pages and you are not a very quick reader  
yeah with the programme  
yeah  
yeah  
for example if we had audio controls those could be something people set up very rarely  
yeah  
no  
you have a heart attack  
and now  
ask my boss  
alright if you think that that's the way it should  
oh gosh this looks complicated  
okay i said at the beginning of the meeting that mm uh well we're not <unk> doing deadlines  
well i have i've only done the first meeting  
yeah  
i will make this quick since we don't have much time  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yep  
per unit i guess  
so we have to make a move on that area i guess  
no no it's not possible  
the temp the temps usually have for gigabyte three or two  
yeah  
right right right  
yeah  
i have that really excited pirate copied thing  
oh yay  
yeah they are not simple  
or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary  
or from from my perspective i think l. c. d. is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing i mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television  
it's just a <unk>  
mm-hmm  
and decisions  
um  
'cause  
reflect about it and uh  
so if he  
so i suggest you make us the elephant in the market  
it can be easier  
maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell where you're starting from and then use the arrow keys  
two  
not very relevant so  
no  
uh  
that was the next question i had  
yeah  
we could  
yeah  
um you say that's a <unk> a required one or a requested one  
but the segments are just made up aren't they  
<unk> maybe minus uh three no  
okay  
we should fire the accountants  
also for detection  
yeah yeah yeah  
fair enough fair enough  
uh uh  
how is everyone  
but i  
yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control  
so better to have a kind of silence detection  
mm-hmm  
move to meeting room  
so i was trying to <unk> them for myself  
but no my research didn't tell me anything which is why we have all the pictures 'cause i had nothing better to do with my time  
um i don't know what new ideas found means to be honest  
i mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions  
what the hell are these  
yeah let's just do that  
um so i've gone through sorry  
maybe you have to uh programme it once so to that <unk> respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence  
okay  
so it's yellow  
right  
uh  
yeah  
you can use the pen  
no  
so still then if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control you just rub on the cover so you rub on the painting  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah that's true  
ads go up  
yeah  
twenty four  
maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons  
yeah  
what  
good this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand  
it <unk> it won't tell but  
hmm  
yeah like for instance if we need to find sub shots  
oh remind me  
well i don't know very much about grammar  
numbers is ten volume is  
few segments which can really represent whole so maybe that's why like this may not be really  
yeah  
bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company  
mm-hmm  
no not necessarily  
or <unk> yeah  
and is yellow  
uh things just to the use the things  
yeah it's  
okay  
i didn't had any time left  
right uh i'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project  
and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here  
and uh even the scroll  
yeah of course  
unfortunately i think we are  
and um  
i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later  
you gave the reading room the best view  
so after you're doing l. s. f. <unk> so or like i mean how you're finally hand coding  
okay okay  
or or like some crazy like electro magnet that you push it and it'll go zoom to the t. v. and stick there  
yeah  
yeah because everything is programmed inside  
yeah  
um conceptual phase i think this is it  
hi  
just resources  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay  
hmm  
uh but uh can't scroll wheels uh work with one uh one curved case  
yeah maybe it's a  
talk about maybe <unk> look at that from the side there maybe  
'cause also like even if we maybe this whole like maybe i'm worrying too much about the whole series in one thing display  
ah now i remember what is r. s. i. it's <unk> stress injury  
yeah  
um okay  
well if they've just developed the sample sensor sample speaker it's a brand new chip  
see  
we just have the time code <unk>  
but also <unk> so the channel  
okay  
probably is but i don't know if the software is on the laptop  
um yeah  
but you're saying it does get used  
it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions yes  
um so now we are going to to get used <unk> to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project  
yeah  
let's see what we got to do  
you can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing <unk> without <unk> it  
yep  
is it uh  
oh  
but who's they  
uh for instance three people supervised by bob <unk>  
so there's one  
so i guess um if i'm gonna be <unk> it with a l. c. <unk> then that's like same format i'd want to um put it back out in so it'd be equivalent  
okay  
if it was just silence it'd be easy  
mm-hmm  
if we imagine it's actually straight and just give it a a score  
and um well they can have two functions because uh you have a d. v. d. and a television  
uh <unk> <unk> <unk> okay i mean uh inevitably a <unk> a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive  
yep  
triple r. it is  
you'd use to calculate entropy scores  
we're given a a clear design brief uh  
whereas the da if you do it in the data manager  
it's a handicapped cat  
or we can <unk> for example we can make a different a basic design  
yeah two  
i always want to have you know sometime i want to have wire because you know  
yes  
because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff  
so  
mm mm  
blah blah blah and i have no artistic talents  
um uh we had a uh brief discussion just before i left about uh this idea of exchanging data by fire wire drive and i do i don't know if that ever got resolved  
but initially i dunno  
yeah  
chip on print is that that's an industrial design thing is it david  
can actually try  
i'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done and i'll get that out to everybody  
we can have both also  
but i do think that it's more trendy than beautiful  
yes  
no  
so it were all positive questions by uh by purpose  
yeah okay  
okay  
and that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have so  
um as you can see most users are uh between thirty six and forty five  
with the red inside it  
so basically what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that  
that in the middle are the the main keys like displayed on the  
no  
okay  
<unk> tough  
menu  
um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set  
um  
open that radius button  
no i mean  
neither should that  
yeah  
okay fine that's too bad  
a and the l. c. d. screen is  
yeah  
so  
right  
yeah  
what were you thinking  
but like probably somebody else wouldn't have said they were excellent  
you're kind of not gonna find it but anywhere else it's gonna stand out  
mm okay  
ye  
but it's it's it's not standard man made movies because i would say most of the time people <unk> didn't do any dissolve  
alright  
but still uh l. s. d. <unk> already quite nice l. c. i'm an artist sorry  
so  
no it is the scroll wheel i guess  
this name so i will say this is video name so video name  
yeah  
but i don't really know what they're for i've never used them  
this is his own remote  
hello everybody  
so you can you have base triangle base so you the t. v. you can  
oops  
'cause th  
okay this is it  
where do you want some more dots  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
personally yeah  
no  
other parts or uh  
yeah <unk>  
so um the idea is you just keep stuff unless  
so it's okay  
mm-hmm  
okay like a lock <unk> like a lock <unk> function on it like you have on your telephones yeah  
i guess this  
yeah but we can't  
so lets you then you have less buttons  
oh yeah  
mm-hmm yeah  
does any of the um the features that <unk> spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality  
well undo  
two  
you can copy and paste the picture if you want  
of course you have a black in the top and uh you have also uh maybe eighty percent of like green uh  
the left one is teletext and the right one is mute  
not very much  
'cause the l. c. d. tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user  
yeah maybe this this is important  
so i'll just  
yeah  
i don't know  
so that's simple  
<unk> yeah  
well there there is a for example on digital t. v. systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in <unk>  
that one or uh  
yeah uh  
yeah we're still yeah  
um it's it's um  
and so do they have the same frequency or  
i think uh i think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy but okay we can discuss about it uh later  
oops let's close that  
so we have that <unk> uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one  
any kind of because then it because seems to me it could be quite obvious  
why  
well we could take out ones by making it single curved just fill in those bits  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
we can target like environmentally friendly ideas that <unk> things  
thank you  
yes  
we are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project  
yeah so then this is it is almost true so a two  
okay  
hmm  
yeah but they're incorporated  
so uh this is the the <unk> of the <unk> of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components  
not an issue to raise here but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity  
yeah it's ours  
an and there is no there is no such thing  
i think  
hmm  
i mean i forgot i we're sort of uh  
specially the the r.  
or just make it little  
like forget the all the m. f. c. c. <unk> because it's too old and then start building the story on the new stuff and not 'cause it's  
yeah that can we we can consider because like it won't take much money i guess because  
yeah that is within the budget  
exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented and <unk> how much it's cost maybe with a <unk> cheap chip  
okay  
more expensive  
just kidding  
of course that's uh interchangeable and uh i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there  
no  
but it's very speaker dependent <unk> on what sort of band width you'd look at this hilbert envelope  
so so <unk> we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns  
no no i think that's  
okay  
it's on  
we have to lower it with six points  
mm  
that sends out the signal  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
oh okay  
alright  
he's uh pushing the meeting forward then this kind of <unk> organ <unk> structure or part  
different skin options or if we can't afford this touch plate thing or touch face screen interface um  
that's really weird 'cause it's just started creeping over  
okay  
mm-hmm  
specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach  
yeah  
definitely  
yeah i don't know  
i don't know whether it's one of those things that  
right  
oh okay  
is that enough time for you to to read and think about  
but i'll i'll go into that deeper in my presentation  
yeah  
uh well on once uh once i've tried out the <unk> stuff i'll see if the if there's any problems gonna <unk> gonna try and fix them  
and the buttons  
to ensure the profit  
um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um shouting you know uh and then what would the response be  
for the three of you because uh i have to write the final report now  
sometimes in the meetings  
um components  
so  
lost  
a e. two is a kind of elliptical  
uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in  
but  
to false seven  
to turn it on  
something which probably starts with the word set  
so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their <unk> remote controls  
true  
it only loads when it needs a particular type of file  
no  
yeah  
yeah of course  
ah yeah  
and um so far um i <unk> think uh it's uh it i think it it's a still um about the <unk> about the same level of segmentation we're talking here  
or it won't  
it's pretty straight forward uh-huh  
okay sorry  
yeah  
oh for the next one mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
they also say that's about uh i thought it was fifty per cent uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls  
yeah  
at this stage we still have no no target audience or  
you wouldn't include line in that  
charge about three hundred quid for it  
we have to choose one  
um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing  
yeah  
okay  
we could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume and  
yeah  
we can get we can always get back to it  
in the in the examples she showed us there were there was some that was just you know one party  
yeah  
yeah it's in frequency domain no  
ah  
mm  
and um the marketing expert will uh will uh <unk> he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation  
okay  
to try and yes and home home in parameters and choose the right sort of settings  
this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product  
yeah  
sure uh can i get the  
okay  
yeah  
no  
so  
yeah so uh following our decision to uh  
this isn't this isn't too much is it  
that's what we decided here  
is tricky  
these are all things that we had sort of addressed before  
th the pen doesn't  
yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them  
so  
prefer pen and paper  
'kay  
no  
yeah but at the same time i think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target  
so the other aspects we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget  
uh well  
if we  
well uh uh  
that's what i was saying  
uh rubber is a soft material i guess  
menu button  
but it all has to do with the budget because it's it's not the bad idea we had so  
it's a little bit long  
um how is the audio thing going  
so um  
a yellow do  
a communication flaw  
and yes that counts  
yeah  
know or looks different  
okay  
well yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
where is the controller  
yeah  
uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product  
okay  
yeah  
um right well one presumes it is otherwise it's gonna be ra radically expensive to do any kind of mark up  
right  
i might just not go for the last question because usually the last question is takes half the time and gives you five percent or something like okay  
yeah  
so we only we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
you know and  
yeah  
we have that here  
could you step a little to the right ma yeah  
mm  
okay thanks  
one simple battery  
yeah the uh  
well i said radio galaxies  
and th that's just so much things that make it look flash  
and special colour  
and the mama scanning machine is an instrument it's not a telescope it's an instrument  
yeah  
no we ha  
or maybe the <unk> and the <unk> in the same place you know in the centre of the  
they  
well not necessarily because you could have your company uh we're we're meant to be finishing up  
we have plenty of things to do  
i mean did you attend any any session  
hmm  
and more about yourself you're from  
mm-hmm  
uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh <unk>  
well what is it huh  
so that's basically what we chose there  
so <unk> uh if it the disk is not replaced then it <unk> it'll fail  
so the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel  
you should be the one to ask is there anything if i'm just a <unk> private person and i want for free any software which is able to read me a book in english  
and this is this is with the curved that i mean  
then it's uh then it's uh yeah one big good curve  
yeah  
i think  
okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero  
you did read the minutes i wrote  
i did see something from <unk>  
it was the first time you start using the cluster i remember or some uh some parallel processing  
okay  
and you're doing this via some software that's like external software so you can't  
i think it will be um <unk> quite easy to use to have uh uh four arrows  
i'm the one proposing the celebration  
per hour  
uh or  
as far as the uh technology it <unk> got the latest trends in speech technology but it's missing the screen  
i'm not so sure  
i know for one that in north america there is no such thing as teletext so it'd be really superfluous  
yellow  
but we if we put  
alright  
to get at a international market uh so um it will be i think mainly europe and uh northern america  
no they're <unk> <unk> uh power friendly <unk> also  
look and feel  
because then  
um  
i <unk> i didn't personally  
sensitive  
it's saying that one of these is more close to the test <unk> <unk> to the the one that we've been given  
you truncated them to  
ergonomics like your hand movements or something  
so you could do it that way  
i don't know we've uh you know very well done uh code in terms of sending signals and so on  
and there are two measures of where the other guy is directing attention that you get from the visual track  
i mean i'm thinking that the informatics  
mm-hmm  
yes  
so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh or  
i think i like the idea but i'm not sure about the what you who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget  
yeah  
components design maybe  
because uh that uh <unk> because my information says it  
because of the budget yeah  
i mean did you have this this excel sheet  
so i think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people  
they won't have nice light uh lighting on in front of them  
uh-huh  
here you are  
yeah the for uh the trendy uh stuff  
i'm not sure  
we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the l. c. d. is going to be somewhere here  
yeah  
like those syntax and then it will speak till it finishes the text  
thank you all  
'kay  
yeah now we can still talk about the material we have some some minutes left uh i <unk> wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course  
so for the older people a more traditional uh form  
or  
we can do that  
or carrot shaped mm  
i <unk> i guess we'll take lunch  
really  
but there was a number of things that came before this right that it sounds like they're not under control yet  
just a slightly different design  
yeah  
uh you have to finish a page before going to a <unk>  
okay  
yeah but i do like the idea but we yeah  
okay  
so all have to do is just change it change that sort of thing so it's uh yeah  
channel volume power  
uh it was function i want to go to  
yeah  
okay  
um well i'll show you the notes  
uh and what size batteries double a. triple a.  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm uh  
yeah  
i think a push button for channel would be better  
if you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing  
so elephants are big strong and gentle and they have great memories and they begin with the letter e. just like ebenezer  
'kay thank you  
only buttons we need is on off volume channels and maybe some options or something else and please make a click compared to this one  
so  
okay yep  
rubber we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea  
well uh notes first meeting  
but uh do <unk> gonna gonna are we going to give it a two tone colour look  
yeah yeah  
and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote  
just about right l. e. g. o. lego  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
make it a special colour and then it look fancy  
yeah about four fifteen yeah  
so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus  
yeah yeah yeah  
alright well let's see then  
yeah there was a mailing list before  
i found this image which is uh well it <unk> the idea of fruits and vegetables  
mm-hmm  
'cause she'll know which email address to use and and everything else  
with the logo and our uh <unk> uh  
yeah  
i think we can do some really in in that department the the ergonomic department we can make some some really good improvements  
mm  
well they're rubber aren't they  
so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button that's kinda confusing  
but but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
but it's quite hard this  
but most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology  
that's true i mean  
yeah  
is it triple r. c. <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
including <unk> voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now  
it looks more like a calculator to people if you have the <unk> the the  
yeah yeah  
okay  
early break  
yeah  
okay  
and the working design was to specify how <unk> the physical <unk> between the components was as i believe  
right  
you don't put your headset microphone  
would you have to leave it by the window  
yeah  
i think  
because even in when i was working in uh like in edinburgh like one guy  
did we talk about the voice recognition uh option  
so those are our options  
any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um  
and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email  
simple chips regular chips  
you can say then you  
because um because i the um the distance between the the microphone is too uh is too low to  
does that sound good  
replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote  
do you know how how i can wake it up  
yeah  
i just i just don't didn't remember seeing in the representation which speaker contributed what  
for noise conditions yeah it's pretty good  
always so  
uh if we dropped uh  
i would be confused with this thing  
you don't really have to i mean if you like 'em  
relative yes  
yeah i it's supposed to be there  
on the second page as it were that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour  
so we're going for an l. c. d. screen  
mm-hmm  
no  
then we go to fourteen point six  
so you'd be advocating an l. c. d. then  
um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale  
right  
or not  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
i think one for that  
like i don't know copies of shakespeare or something  
and have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the <unk> the product  
<unk> i don't think is an instrument  
mind when the  
those are all the  
or what will say  
there you go  
mm-hmm  
it's very easy to use  
uh i should be able to actually if i email it to you now  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah ferret  
uh suitable for the consumer  
it's basically to do that  
but people of often don't like bright colours or something  
yeah  
uh with direct show issue  
yeah i like the cow  
yeah yeah  
like  
but i tried to  
yeah i think sorry  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so  
not really um just what he's talking about like duplication of effort and  
thirty <unk> uh controls on it  
um  
uh i rather find it very annoying um like when someone is standing in front of the t. v. then you can't switch it  
and here  
okay  
it's not the easiest i've got to  
besides you have four sides to a thing so i mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well so  
maybe  
uh  
but otherwise it's not necessary  
it's a good point  
but yeah  
by big brother  
yeah  
i just have a question about that  
all these uh so voice calling yeah voice calling and these thing because that's easy like  
um but there you go that's what we're up against and i think we can do much better than that  
i'm actually not sure if i've saved my presentations  
that's a turtle  
okay  
yeah  
that's that's really fun  
and it basically you go off it downloads the movie it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your t. v.  
yeah  
i don't know  
i am not the <unk> the only one choosing yeah  
well have a think about it  
yeah  
you could go one to one to ten  
um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons  
you said <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
like playing around sort of figuring out what's the best way of combining them by playing around and looking at the results  
false  
well that's the thing i'm i'm not sure um  
of what  
so what i'm having is so we we had a we had a long problem about not finding out why the time <unk> up between the relative time in in a in a sort of in a in a <unk> section and the absolute time didn't correspond and stuff  
no  
but  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
well happy celebration huh  
i think it's a process myself  
decision  
yeah but that that might be something i think that's more of a look and feel decision because i don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources  
<unk> oh and you've knocked batteries out  
yeah well arrow <unk> buttons can be blue  
we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers uh we just have to see what it looks like  
so there must be some cheap standard cover um maybe white or something  
any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market  
for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for <unk> limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
i think so  
i think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory uh non volatile memory  
i i like the whole having a shell thing  
i want one  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's a three uh with seventy five uh  
we've got a a prototype  
then you can change of task and use a task the task we were mentioning about the back channel or foreground channel  
um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that but again except that um you know the risk of losing it  
<unk> well  
for you  
um do we need it to uh i can't think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light up at all  
yeah that's <unk>  
okay  
and maybe go with the one the special form buttons then we could have the speech  
yeah  
okay  
like i said we have to make a decision on  
six  
mm-hmm  
so all in all i think we've done very well  
mm  
then the they're through that data uh from through  
<unk> engineer  
if you want want to use the new versions etcetera  
you could you could uh just play around a bit with  
you mean it like this  
uh  
yeah  
for people that um can't see the numbers as well or um perhaps an ergonomic design  
okay so  
do we need five  
mm-hmm  
alright  
well i i guess if you use the l. c. d. screen you first have to search where is the on button  
and easy to use  
to the document  
and so we have to go i think in the other direction  
oh you ha you have ten minutes left i uh read  
yes  
you know here's a couple of you know here's the two most relevant works that i've read or something like that you know to just  
um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time  
mm right  
okay  
uh  
talks that are on a similar topic together but also if people need the same kind of computer set up  
i've save it on my computer my presentation  
so should we maybe say <unk> a five and say it is intuitive but it's different  
segments um and for th um segments is for example when when you look at the data what is displayed in one line  
okay so although we are <unk> on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh  
um then yeah  
yeah  
okay  
oh  
okay  
and then <unk> be patient  
it's rubber  
participant two  
like as of yet that has nothing to do with um the way it'll look  
i think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be  
i dunno i didn't get any pictures  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
alright  
so interactivity is a concept is a concept that i'm using to distinguish the two uh uh extremes of uh of <unk> uh of discourse in meetings  
that as long as <unk> other people don't for some reason i don't know disconnect some bits of the equipment there's no reason why they should  
mm  
<unk> touch  
okay  
uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget  
just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid market range  
and just let's see what else  
yeah  
it's gonna cost more  
uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important  
uh i think th this is device which which has a learning curve  
yes  
so three  
but i mean the older so  
energy  
is it  
for  
yeah  
so basically <unk> software we will build will look more or less the same as these two  
so this would ma be made uh manually actually  
don't mess with my birds yeah  
that's the mic noise okay  
and you know here the more <unk> important aspect is the fancy look and feel after is uh technological innovative and after the easy to use  
well i <unk> i can see maybe wanting to know whether you can do the <unk> just based on the actions without the language in cases where they use both  
i would  
um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made i would say  
and  
um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control  
oh sorry  
uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs  
yeah  
just classical uh frame by frame algorithm twenty milliseconds  
it's a board decision  
but that's what i'll do  
for when you lose the remote control it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that rather than a standard beep beep  
so i mean all the conversational analysis stuff i mean those guys never count anything you know  
yeah  
okay this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage  
on the top  
oh no let's have the prototype presentation  
mm-hmm  
four  
well  
then twenty five euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard t. v. so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high priced basic remote  
or one  
so so how many batteries do we need  
that's that's another issue which i didn't think of  
okay  
yeah  
i think there should be a break for and  
so you get your exchange structure marked up  
and we have forty minutes again  
mm-hmm  
i am the industrial designer  
alright  
let me understand well because i'm not sure that's for that this one are <unk> <unk> uh two <unk> directional button  
that should be because it's not an absorber it's an absorption  
and uh colours can be provided with the case rather than  
so that'll be decided i guess  
mm-hmm  
um  
i guess  
yeah that will be nice  
okay so  
okay  
yeah  
and you and you haven't done it yet  
like i was before when the bandwidth conditions were really stringent then they were using all the <unk> l. p. c. based source filter  
so  
um it's come to my attention the following  
mm  
okay  
and can be confusing because because of their difference and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have  
any volunteers  
okay  
i guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent  
but that has a menu button separate from a select button whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button  
or  
just like with the nokia uh mobile phones  
hmm  
as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow it's not such a fast board it's a smart board but also a slow board  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
well yeah yeah okay  
at le yeah  
yeah  
and we don't want triangle one to suddenly have bigger stuff  
so switching over i've just left uh my first two screens  
i like it  
i think i think there needs to be a little i think it's too too sharp  
yes  
guaranteed  
oh and you can also if you go to signal and  
exactly  
the zap yeah  
so maybe something that like  
but  
um see in l. c. d. like you will have blocks and you select which one  
i i you have to train your uh  
to the industrial design department  
um  
so they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells yeah  
there's no need to spend money on research and development but this does mean the need for microphones in the  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
right now customers want fancy versus functional  
and thus gives on the signal  
okay  
mm  
so you yes you have to to <unk> to uh to say let's say yes  
yeah  
under the title of <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
oh sorry  
and then i i look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick so we don't want that  
um but i'm at the moment i've i've been playing with the dom stuff in <unk>  
yeah  
i agree  
okay so you can i guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec  
so this is some envelope which is in our case related to hilbert envelope  
mm  
yeah okay the for processing part  
the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another  
from <unk> stability point of view uh it certainly is  
so where do you want to put it  
do we have to uh  
okay well that's fine  
of course because you don't have to have a button for everything  
r. three c.  
um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit  
but that's alright  
yeah  
you guys ready to celebrate  
but then we should also have an uh an okay button  
yeah  
so this would be the front  
yeah  
so the features i think we got the scroll we've got the uh the locator we've got the durability  
so this isn't directly having time references but you can get the oh it is actually here  
those kind of things  
good luck  
that's a <unk> that's psychology thing how hard they  
now it's yes  
it should  
you could point to it if it were there  
i was just checking that uh i know the language part because they say l. p. here but uh this would be the the the new part  
the agenda  
so  
no it was in my uh my information so uh  
that's selfish  
mm  
press on  
i like that  
uh-huh  
you can just see what's up  
yeah i guess we can probably process the data for all different series and then check which series is the best for the presentation  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
<unk> i <unk> i it'll look fancy with l. c. d. screen  
mm  
of course in that we could put l. c. d. or recognition to be more technologically innovative  
somebody else or i don't know somebody new uh <unk> but i think some <unk> somebody like a. t. and a. t. and t. or what  
uh a domain a direction for your thesis for your exactly  
uh a light in indication light that you know that it's functioning  
okay  
and it's made out of rubber  
yeah  
yeah  
i don't wanna waste it  
right  
yeah twelve euro fifty yeah  
well it's manual to to <unk> it the frame  
it'd be a huge disaster especially if it looks like that  
what are these for  
yeah  
yeah  
not  
oh right  
you know you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that  
<unk> yeah someone said three months  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
um  
even though for you wouldn't it be easier if you had different files because then you sort of know like  
the reaction deluxe  
yeah sure  
well  
and a light bulb  
so  
um well uh i can think of some reactions from the people <unk> so maybe i can well <unk>  
it's not like we work you know nine to five or whatever  
the one that i just say give me one hundred values over that length and then you're internally okay  
so it's afterwards  
yeah  
so um then i we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
anyway he's in edinburgh  
with titanium it's it is silver  
awesome  
i once had it  
no we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons  
um  
and um i thought not too edgy and like a box  
no no um  
no only when it's embedded  
so we're looking at um well again we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups  
um do you think if we override their component and just override whatever the the action to that slide bar is  
you know where you can use both hands like a little keyboard type thing  
so we should think about  
yeah  
so it's i mean it's pretty good at the moment but it's gonna get worse isn't it  
<unk> sweet  
okay  
yes and i'm pretty sure i'm bottom anyway  
yeah  
hmm  
um then we have uh the lower part  
yeah  
but when use it uh i don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition  
do but will it word without that at all  
have we factored that in  
was <unk> kinda true  
mm  
yeah  
for example  
uh just one note to the chan channel changing  
yeah  
yeah  
mm i guess not  
he was the <unk> no yeah <unk> he was working i think in <unk> o. g. i. even  
right  
i can't do anything  
l. c. d. and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons  
yes that's uh something extras  
uh well i'll be talking about the components  
yeah  
and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know this is really identifiable  
mm-hmm  
the weak interactivity  
yeah  
so  
i don't i don't know what i mean  
hmm  
some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end  
now you wanna tell which i i this page uh <unk> example of what it was is that is says on the page lotus elise  
yeah  
so i mean it it makes it easier  
yes  
yeah maybe like that  
we we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here  
you can't uh click the corners  
therefore be found  
uh no because particularly if they've <unk> if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh i mean it it's uh it it's just i mean it's just a minor detailed point  
to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if <unk> <unk> you only get to see them when you need 'em  
mm 'kay  
work my subject  
and the consumer yeah we aim for young consumers so that's fine  
okay  
yeah  
<unk> but you can better yeah dump the l. c. d. screen then  
it's not gonna yeah  
or hold it ten seconds  
yes  
yeah and and the voice recognition we can use that can't we just to find it  
would change your remote control for a <unk> for a new one  
what was that last wee bit there  
mm  
yeah that's probably quite a good idea  
i mean if you <unk>  
i i'll have a uh yeah i'll have a <unk> a look at the actual <unk> licence  
it <unk> okay  
we uh aim at the younger market  
yeah but be serious then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control  
one  
yes there is actually  
like i've got one at home that has  
okay cool  
it's a bit sad sort of that we do this before we've truly figured out how the nite x. m. l. thing works  
you can take plastic  
did you draw it  
it's i think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff  
but uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that  
we've already had the five minute warning so  
uh oh the side  
oh that's true  
yeah press them  
i mean that's that's something that some way closes here  
but i'll come back to it later  
'cause you might have followed that rule  
so it might literally just be okay  
kind of let's say idea is usually hundred milliseconds or one second  
this month isn't it  
do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as l. c. d.  
so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us  
but you should uh decide where you want to put it  
okay  
okay  
so  
evaluation  
well fifty million and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one then awful lot need to be sold  
i know <unk> uh but there should be an <unk> as well  
it was two percent  
didn't receive it  
uh  
no  
mm-hmm  
i thought asterisk is something where um it's <unk> it's pronounced as a totally different word like evaluation and evolution  
if we have a more <unk> uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set up that we that i've just presented  
a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television  
but for two euros and thirty cents we uh we don't get a docking station  
and you can just uh <unk> when you buy it you can select um personal preference parental control on and the password or something  
or or is it too hard to to <unk> to just do it all on your remote  
on our remote control concept and how we're gonna make it what uh materials we're gonna use and that sort of thing  
and uh and so you know  
it's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing you know kinda push it  
this is not a good question i think  
there was uh the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or how it's called the <unk> then then  
i don't really know what you think about that  
um well this one of our aims not have too much buttons  
so instead of classical l. p. c. domain where you have a spectrum let's say something like that  
yeah  
a mute function  
okay  
yeah  
so um is that gonna have a voice over or is it we had discussions before you started about whether it should be completely silent so that they could use in case we ever wanted to do this in in dutch  
all this was for one time frame  
if i can skip more accurately then  
just kinda stretch it over  
so we've pretty much pared it down to on off volume mute channel up and down um the numbers  
um  
yeah  
a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner  
<unk> not <unk> well if it's each you have to <unk> you have to break it down into another tier right  
okay  
anyway you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him  
mm  
we might need to just remind her of the dates in case she doesn't know so she gets the dates right  
yeah the blue one uh spongy  
uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years  
um so the number in the first brackets is um so i run it on all the b. e. d. b. m. r. and b. r. o. meetings to learn it  
yeah participant two  
yeah goodbye mic  
it has to be small  
yeah  
but that's that's fun for the first time and then the second  
so there is no structure indeed so of course when you look the horse and then you can see as a cow the cows  
so um it it but it basically means we <unk> we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or <unk> kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done  
yeah  
uh  
you had different remote controls for different devices  
hmm  
no clapping i think clapping yeah  
what does each of you  
i mean the time stamp is i in the signal  
they are based on infra red uh waves or uh uh radio waves  
okay  
okay  
and then we <unk> make a decision in the sense whether you continue working or we try to find the time in a different way or we try to eliminate your other priorities you're under  
as we want to <unk> the benefit  
course we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that  
hmm  
not as flexible maybe yeah but <unk> yeah  
yeah  
but it's but but this is just from marketing uh aspect  
but also things like like like menus or <unk> how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example  
we need to decide well so we can figure how big it's gonna be like exactly what buttons we want and exactly  
yeah  
yeah  
but it's flat it's flat as as this so we can <unk> make all the products as flat as this  
it could be a <unk> it could be a cover  
okay  
i notice it too  
so i think it should be much more <unk> to make a different uh shapes  
no so we <unk>  
'kay  
hmm okay  
right here  
there's a wait for command for an external ca like for an external call to make sure that the external thing is finished because in general like that's sort of running parallel  
so this is really about <unk> uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah  
so just to <unk> the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation  
uh <unk> well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric <unk> uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end  
but then we've also got fashion which is something that definitely appeals to younger people  
that's just a signal to <unk> <unk> they send a <unk> signal to the <unk> <unk> t. v. that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash  
well uh i use it that useful for generating this g. d. f. stuff  
yep  
um i would say we should say dumber than the average person  
or it is  
that should that should be fun  
yeah okay three  
yeah  
could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example  
i can't see it going on for an hour to be honest  
no it just takes the top like twenty or fifty or however many  
uh yes if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough  
hmm  
i don't think i can uh say much about it  
so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one  
yeah and you have <unk> in common with nancy  
that's right  
like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark  
uh  
so that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want  
okay  
and the buttons  
the question i'm asking is what's the history of the construct  
because we have to lose two things and i guess  
i th i got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most <unk> one  
so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition  
mm-hmm  
no absorption lines should be in and the same here  
and that's usually dialogue what what's difference i between provenance dialogue act and between <unk>  
'kay  
then i did a <unk> second one with a nicer layout which i could uh know  
so we can uh  
yeah  
it it is yeah because uh <unk> yeah you <unk> it with uh actually <unk> this is kinda wrong  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
to the whole our company  
yeah but what happens if <unk> someone is standing then  
what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project  
i have a t. v. and tomorrow i am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me  
we have the okay button  
yeah but when you zap down zero you get to a. v.  
but the people have a new television and <unk> if you look into the future then they want will want the button if their thing is broke  
yeah  
you can ask bob  
yeah  
okay that's good  
uh you're finish  
yeah  
well i basically had a question  
none of the other animals walk like this  
we're good  
that's the way they walk  
because we did make a another one which wa uh is in the shape of banana it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons  
we might as well dump all the fields we want into the database calculate everything from there  
it's a bit uh childish you have to write  
or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use  
um so we need to look at we need to look at where we're gonna ho hold it  
well alright well this is more like purple i guess but it's should be more real dark blue  
mm-hmm  
a giraffe okay  
yep  
okay  
so he's comparing the likelihood of the full segment divided by the likelihood of the the sub segments  
i mean it's uh but you know you know uh  
um the costs are within the budget we evaluated the project and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary  
yeah  
let let's say next meeting <unk> you produce two designs one one  
but that was about it  
the price should be below twelve and a half euro  
yes slogan from  
mm-hmm  
regular chip  
try it yeah maybe  
yeah  
okay okay  
hopefully no one will have anything too specialized  
isn't that a process  
yeah okay  
so do you have a technique for estimating how much data you'd need  
that's the background colour  
yeah  
con  
three  
so what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into  
shown from this point of view it <unk> that things mm there are other things  
but if you go from two to eight and you want  
i have the original in my um  
for the segments  
um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask is it easy to use  
do <unk> do you did we want to have a <unk> mute button  
he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants  
you can zap away  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
well people do though don't they  
yeah and you can do on l. c. d. using these going to <unk> all the option  
it would be very new but it's a kind of a retro uh style i think  
and we have think i got a new project requirement  
so it doesn't <unk> doesn't have any  
yeah if we i yeah  
dimension as well  
do you think  
we need to remove them  
yeah  
so what  
good  
yeah  
oh no it's gonna have to do something a bit more complicated than that  
that's enough thanks  
'kay  
um i was having a a general outlook on um <unk> most like sophisticated features  
yeah this is just the the wheel  
um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it um  
the ami dat the ami data what that like that only most of the time you knew they had the word  
big buttons are convenient voice recognition helps push buttons scroll buttons spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools  
so so that don't think there's anything to add to the software for that part  
i see  
it  
right  
so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board  
hmm  
yeah even  
yeah you get the complex complex spectrum with this  
yeah  
uh  
right  
pretty sure that's already there  
feedback  
which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control  
have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting and then the numbers on one side  
uh that's the infrared uh thing  
right it's very they're very cheap remote  
is you're not sure from the documentation what it says it can do  
just putting all these things into sound then then having a written summary  
okay  
here is our here are uh  
uh but uh i'll open it on the <unk> so we can all see it  
so is for so half next year  
they turn it on they watch certain specified channels you know and then they turn it off again  
but just the basic functions  
yep  
isn't that a better signal  
okay  
yeah  
uh the first question is uh is the device good looking  
a big fat body and  
we going to cut  
old people  
um i would guess this comes back from this whole b. thing links in here so possibly for left handed  
um i think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment  
so there has to be some space between the buttons  
ooh  
that's fine  
in those in that  
the on off button in red  
mm-hmm  
you should go for the next one it seems to me  
i think if we had a a locating device with the small one i think that seems way more advanced  
one question i have and i don't know how much control we have over this is um  
so we don't know what happened at that one  
yeah it would be great to use the white board  
well i dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote  
remote control  
they gotta change between disney channel cartoon network  
no that wouldn't be uh  
it's a starting point anyway so  
do you put the laughter in front  
i think if they were just all small round blue buttons it'd be fine  
okay  
and the current remote controls do not match well the operating <unk> of the user  
it's using speech recognition yeah  
merge  
didn't really finish it  
it's not going to present any <unk> any micro structure  
yes that's a good idea i think  
that's true i i got this spreadsheet  
i do i don't think i'd go over a hundred euro certainly that would be way too much  
just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons i think is the the point being made  
yes yes  
uh i've never seen tool tips displaying several lines and stuff though so i wonder how good that'll look  
is that you've probably not had time to work on that  
i think it inc increase  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
i'm sorry  
alright  
yeah  
maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the <unk> the the look and feel of uh i've it was a good idea maybe to to  
mm-hmm  
mm yeah  
let's see  
and the b. b. c.  
'kay what else  
yeah can you save that uh send that last one again please raj as i still can't find it on the  
thank you very much  
and then um  
so i mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us  
i even got spam  
um now some of the other things i found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it  
it's called like the phase  
red  
um and from that and <unk> basically all all the all the tracks are doing is saying at this between this time there's a look at this <unk> this object  
yeah you told me you <unk> you <unk> you <unk> you lost your control your t. v. so so you need to buy one  
mm-hmm  
ah ha  
like that  
'cause it it have to be universal so  
well  
no one drawing it  
that that's about it really  
because uh if you say uh let's say uh <unk> how much the person um have spoken over the the five last minutes uh  
interesting thing is that they applied it on speaker recognition and on the features before they had three different ways to um <unk> the features  
yeah if if you take it if you <unk> if you <unk> if you create a new part it uh it gets a new i. d.  
so it's somebody and simon king is playing with that right the <unk> guy  
somebody in the techie group will have a <unk> catalogue  
yeah might be  
pas  
and a lot of the information on the <unk> i don't think you know we needed to actually it could have  
what do we well what do we know  
so then then  
um  
mm-hmm  
well i do think l. c. d. is more reachable than the speech recognition  
to maintain old technology exactly  
okay  
uh question on can i ask a question  
so  
yes  
it will uh be a  
uh  
she says delicately  
alright  
hmm  
um  
single curve should be fine so  
oh <unk> so i can print obscene messages in the background to um standard output  
half a euro too much  
okay it's a <unk> presentation  
you have a uh i have packets uh for uh let's say uh this is uh this is uh not uh fixed  
component i think  
yeah  
i like uh oh they don't have pink  
talking to the bosses basically and uh  
mm yeah  
yeah  
and  
i didn't expect anyway  
mm-hmm  
ah that's a good idea  
mm  
where  
okay but you have sound  
and one day you'll be able to <unk> genetically modify them and they will come in pink  
well i don't know what to do but  
okay  
i mean for example the goo <unk> you say we would we would to have a google like controller  
this is  
mm i think  
<unk> good  
okay good  
this is the one in the d. v. d.  
yeah also thinking i think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh euros it will be okay but uh  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah he may want to <unk> yeah yeah  
no  
yes  
normal for logical <unk>  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
hmm  
uh  
say here  
for showing text  
you see  
um anybody have i got more master classes anybody else wanna like take a master's class  
and  
it is scary  
are the costs within budget  
yeah  
i am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and i previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators  
okay that's all  
so anyway we have well  
a zero  
and you can find the minutes in the project documents folder inclusive the uh buttons  
playstation thing  
lo sort of loch ness banana  
put a sliding bar into this so that people see where they are  
that would be probably the <unk> part  
yeah yeah sure  
we cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp  
right  
i don't know whether anybody else has other ideas  
what else  
and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled and i'll be doing research to figure this out  
yeah yeah  
that's true  
hmm  
what i'm really worried about is making sure that um there's not big surprises for ellen and and j. p. you know  
yeah  
uh  
just tap it  
if they want to should they have priority  
alright  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
well uh let's uh talk about that later uh  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
a and for one group that's true because it's sort of like their meeting's you know like that one meeting and then  
repetitive strain injury  
yes  
what speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market  
just  
i think it's easier than traditional controller  
possibly  
yeah i i know what you mean but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player  
we  
okay  
i don't know about any preference of maggie being alone or with bruno or no  
is is is there is nothing like <unk> you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave  
a nice material  
<unk> possible to lose curve  
and uh if we if we could inc uh include a <unk> a cradle in which it could recharge  
uh  
okay but i think this is not a <unk>  
okay it goes yeah but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now  
and vets i like vets as well  
<unk> slow  
i mean  
yeah so okay we should better choose one <unk> one shape  
inverse hilbert  
that's called medium or regular  
either a button or tracking device  
slippery  
and that's because i shifted it i basically had it on monday tuesday  
yeah  
okay  
you can yeah  
maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way  
just add some <unk> sounds classier  
and the advanced chip goes away as well  
well i it should be easy that's <unk> <unk> what we concluded  
right  
info val just <unk> to each of those segments  
um  
well that's  
for the cheap price we have for the cheap price we want to  
uh oh yeah the the <unk> of the the buttons  
findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed we need rubber for buttons  
mm we need to move this  
what's the agenda for this meeting  
<unk> f. n. and f. eight  
yeah  
but normally as you can see there we put the uh number buttons right on top  
you must use the maximum of it  
uh if well yes but that probably isn't going to be easy to get out because you'd then have to break up uh the parts somehow  
yes solar cells are also stated  
uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control sometimes it happen  
anybody see anything that they liked in these ones  
it's they're designed specifically to ignore  
are you going to put the the notes on the  
um it said it could talk to you but it never said anything about being able to listen  
um <unk> this with a more precise direction evaluation to know where in the sector the person is  
is the what what i th what are they i don't really understand the the parts that are operating here  
um and uh oh yeah and i'll i can have a look at the model builder as well  
well it's looks fancy especially with the green colour  
yeah  
oh yeah very true  
yeah  
no but yes this is the same but uh there was a problem when do the grab from the d. v. d. to the files  
you know not too complex  
do your thing  
that would be amazing though yeah  
of course they have already one  
and the third problem was to find the remote control  
'cause people do ask me  
is there an order  
that is that is a good idea actually  
uh ultra modern uh kinda remote for twelve uh <unk> uh twelve and a half euro  
yeah yeah yeah we know  
mm-hmm um  
and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
and criteria seven which is the last one does it get lost  
yeah  
um next thing we're doing is having lunch  
so um the idea is that we've got the  
uh format  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah <unk>  
i dunno if you can  
you have to save it  
no they're they're on two <unk> the two separate machines and the you you start and end them separately  
yep and that's the presentation  
yeah  
wait wait wait  
okay  
so that <unk> ten word  
yeah that's true  
and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that  
right continue  
it's soft and  
for i mean uh volume and three double click for the menu or something  
right  
people want it to be that but <unk> still they care more about the way it looks than what it does  
or spec mm specific  
uh apparently microsoft sometimes or like at least in the past the demonstrations where they just exactly knew which five percent of the system were working  
yeah yeah  
five minutes  
mm  
yeah  
i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator  
well a case  
yeah but <unk> people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so  
yeah normal  
yeah that's a bit of problem maybe  
that was mm-hmm  
yeah  
or or spongy an yeah  
the <unk> uh the mute button to switch the volume on and <unk> on and off  
yeah  
it could have been a little bit more innovative <unk> by using the kinetic uh energy source but it's it's way too yes but  
some findings himself  
so ninety two's not that long ago  
see shall we wait  
i mean this one seems  
okay  
we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package  
<unk> you  
yeah  
i think um if if i can hook on to that um the kinetic thing is very funny  
two guys  
<unk>  
'kay maybe  
yeah yeah  
yeah i think it's you can't really get confused with that  
and mine was even it was different again  
yes we'll have the slide away  
what what does anyone want  
yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because i think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably <unk> buy  
i'm the industrial designer for this project  
the one on top is for the um well the <unk> the <unk> and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well  
mm-hmm  
and i said well just look at the the headings  
you know it's it's it's uh <unk> <unk> it it it it's exactly  
you don't make a remote control of ah  
yeah  
uh i think we don't have that in our budget  
yeah  
oh  
oh yeah it's  
and for voice limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote  
and  
yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um and  
uh-huh  
yeah  
there are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device  
i <unk>  
we'll see  
yeah  
if you have any th problems like that mm um see caroline hastings  
i mean most of the time i mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the t. v.  
because if if if i want to go to herve i probably call secretary  
okay  
i want them to really know that it's addressed to them  
seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf so i don't exactly what cost would be incurred  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience  
you don't know have any change on that right  
right  
in the corpus of the tam two thousand four tam presentation twenty five percent of the presentation have no outline at all  
okay  
mm-hmm  
what's it gonna yeah what's it gonna look like  
um  
so what you're saying is like a new problem for us which is i'm gonna change  
so that i think it still has to be a variation  
yes  
it's a it's great it's a good idea but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for <unk> easy to use  
yep  
yeah  
okay that's a good idea  
i don't know  
it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that  
mm  
seven by me  
otherwise we have to do it all over again  
that's what it means  
the access yeah  
yeah  
well yeah me too  
mm uh it sounds good actually yeah  
i think so we're more or less con we <unk> <unk> we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function  
um  
alright  
but um  
we only have a a short amount of time  
that's important to know uh when you design a thing of course  
now it's gone again  
yep  
uh but i think his question is more uh general  
ah it's very cheap  
with the right with the left hand one  
oh yeah  
gotta cut up  
right  
just you're starting with  
okay  
so now that's the construct  
so um yes including the power <unk> supply as well  
the fruit and <unk> idea  
one  
mm  
and we th need to promote our company more so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote  
it's no it's not  
well do <unk>  
why does the price and and the <unk> oh one uh <unk> yeah  
you know how um different interfaces are very different  
do we have a fancy look and feel  
so one needs to be able to say  
that's me  
th these are things that i've after checking um <unk> everybody's work um these are things that were commonly left out or you know <unk> mis transcribed whatever  
maybe can you combine both or like in two person room <unk> too  
uh like many cell phones just a round <unk> well should we just use a  
it <unk> can't be more than twelve fifty per unit  
yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device only your television  
so in the beginning so the meeting started with the summary of what happened uh previous time and this was not related to what was on the slides  
what kind of functions <unk> shall we have  
okay so just stick to to regular  
but uh even uh after removing them uh there it it remains uh independent  
perfect  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
we didn't have a <unk>  
she send it to me by email  
yeah  
three  
oh i just have one question  
i think that'd probably scare me  
it  
so project manager it's participant one at a. m. i.  
yeah  
so when i can say start collecting data uh i start using  
and then we can see how we can tie that in with the other stuff  
off um <unk> the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen  
drawings but oh teeth  
they must have been pissed off saying like numbers at the end of every meeting  
it's my favourite uh pet animal 'cause they're cute they're independent and cuddly i dunno  
um voice activation could be an interesting idea but i think that our <unk> industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible  
'kay a battery or something to keep it going  
we're  
i had i've had some market information but not from the company no  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
<unk> five minutes  
my name's  
when it succeeds uh it can get a two mu  
who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work  
ah yeah  
yeah  
i think we really took that into account a lot so i'm gonna give it a one  
new back end or new anything but they start from the old stuff  
and then it is a <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  
yes  
ooh uh  
and the display requires an advanced chip which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip  
well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing  
mm love to eat that now  
but this is really fancy  
do you vote uh christine  
yeah  
fewer buttons simpler to use and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used  
but we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price  
oh alright i thought that you said that  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
um an animal  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um basically this is all there is  
yeah i uh <unk> was wondering that too  
yeah  
ouch  
with is it is it part of so th these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets of codes against time right  
yeah <unk> no i mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control people won't see it as a remote control um and uh  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
i i agree  
i was like like i said before i i think we should have the r. r. on the uh on the top function button  
as far as i'm concerned it doesn't really matter whether those are in or out  
oh no they are the same  
we hadn't had any ma <unk> out  
because spongy design i don't like it as okay so could you please fabien open it  
okay  
i don't know  
mm  
but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone <unk> yeah yeah  
hope it's readable  
yeah  
right so  
the the remote control needs to be original  
yeah i <unk> well uh not with this one but yeah  
yes it could be a lot of things  
we're not catering to the pensioners of the world i don't think so  
oh i di these are already in our shared folder so  
but i guess everybody does have some idea so i don't think um there's a need for that  
now for buttons normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required  
have you ever like looked into different ways of calculating 'cause i was just thinking like i mean the for example the the <unk> um what's it called  
okay  
i have one thing about it but it's a small thing but it'd mean we'd have to make a right handed one and a left handed one  
so sure that the j. c. t. is actually working collaborating collaborating between the two machines  
twelve buttons  
good  
uh but as you can see the left remote is quite um quite busy looking quite complicated  
that's another three  
um well since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway  
and here this la this directory is doing the same thing like associating some topics with some documents manually  
does it  
i'm guessing  
we might have some um  
okay  
<unk>  
okay okay  
do we have um  
yeah  
okay  
okay that's  
yeah like the stuff for i think it has to be yeah  
better more intuitive buttons yes  
so you know what practical things can we do to help this work move forward  
like <unk> you wouldn't hear the speaker  
yeah  
but now it's working better because now it's on a much more evenly distributed  
no i know but i have to uh evaluate it  
fine  
this will improve the phoneme uh recognition rate  
i think we should decide what we want it to actually look like in the end  
yeah it looks uh uh the segment thing looks in the into the words x. m. l. file and the dialogue acts  
and then <unk> and then write the <unk> to a file  
okay  
yeah  
alright  
if the if  
<unk> see that is going to tell us uh something like uh <unk> the thing is that i uh it it see you can totally go into the text domain and be there  
yeah  
yeah  
may maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the l. c. d. screen just into this this bubble  
fair enough  
nothing  
oh this is the wrong one  
yeah  
i think we should uh have interactive and non interactive on the board and then figure out what properties going to each just so we're clear what the two mean  
okay  
good luck  
and links down the site but the links were all pictures  
okay  
exactly  
how hard is it  
okay and then so height wise  
this  
so this is done for one second eight thousand samples for eight kilo hertz sampling frequency right  
yeah  
you can throw with it and  
you know they're grey they've i mean this one's got loads of buttons  
like <unk> you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing something like that but you know being physical  
with the evaluation you have to  
broad line  
it's there's something to be said i mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to  
mm-hmm  
um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black  
you know um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less  
um we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available  
that's not my problem  
ah  
yeah  
what kind of task was it  
accounting for galactic <unk> contamination from blended iron  
i think  
but still i think we can't really do these things before <unk> because yeah  
mm  
oh we still need an okay button  
it's i'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway because i thought we <unk> i thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started  
well so it was not such a difficult process then  
okay  
result make something  
flat uh  
yeah  
to to apply what  
sort of windows style drop down menus or whatever i think maybe that's a bit  
okay so that's good  
yes  
also i can um before marius left he he has he had actually left himself  
um and so like favourite channels is is applicable  
we couldn't use these but we <unk> we are using these scroll buttons like this  
if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it yeah  
uh yeah  
no  
there are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in  
for example one that i really would like to do which is kind of fun  
are you  
it's a bit risky risky  
yeah  
the interface will be different  
right  
okay  
mm-hmm i know but  
okay here  
to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah in an in an easy manner if is possible  
i assume we just pull it out  
and the buttons are here then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side  
i think you should still ask barbara again you know <unk> can you have another think about who might have the <unk> stuff  
mm  
yeah  
well new ideas found by this  
just something to get give me something to work with  
yeah then then you could do everything i suppose because usually the t. v. <unk> have <unk> that inside in this other little piece of software so it's okay  
beep  
well i would argue about see because i think that i mean th that you only extract that after you actually model a <unk> spectrum don't you  
so it's a good start for us  
mm  
if you if you would set it off  
mm  
maybe if it would need some higher level analysis before it could be directly used for that purpose we should still keep that in mind  
um  
people know what to do very quickly  
feels wrong  
uh the ones make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want  
is that all okay  
so well how we did do that  
i think  
yeah  
so these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen  
so basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product  
mm-hmm  
right so i'll do the minutes of uh this meeting  
yeah well <unk> that's uh for later down the road um and then as for the user interface it should be trendy  
so i i'll send you links some of the papers are long but you can just um briefly look yeah  
as i said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty euros  
so it must be a some sort of pink package  
for u. i. d. the technical functions design  
no but you need you need new remote controller then  
cradle or not cradle  
oh  
because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it  
because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost  
hmm  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
two  
hopefully that should be it this time  
it'd look really lovely  
yeah  
eighty percent  
if you just click return it should be okay  
okay  
you know  
maybe if you we uh really want to improve the the quality then we will need it i don't know still  
um 'kay  
so we have to decide on that in a minute  
so you were when when did you do that  
but i also didn't not really  
the combined measure might not be if we want to wait what the user has typed in into the search  
but you guys probably know off the top of your head is there anything else that we we we were waiting on before you could run  
okay  
hmm  
this is maybe because of f. f. t. u. or these things  
yeah  
well there's a white board right  
yeah  
and moreover th the button <unk> are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side because you have light on buttons  
we we may not delete anything  
she's it's do you wanna explain how it it works or  
yeah  
no no no no no  
well you can draw over it with white uh pen  
mm-hmm  
and the joystick away  
and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared  
because um i i think it's actually very similar to what i did for my um speaker um uh extraction and i think i would <unk> perhaps have to change two lines of codes to get you um for each meeting a file that says <unk> from um this millisecond to this millisecond there was this sequence of words  
yeah  
so some fancy <unk> gonna have to be done to say i was looking at triangle one and now i'm looking at triangle one in construct one  
but there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance level  
yeah we can we can put a seven here  
spongy buttons  
i'm gonna take some notes  
to to confirm a a kind of action  
it's a <unk> basically the same thing actually  
it it feels like rubber but  
mm-hmm  
no mouse needed  
we're all set then  
like try  
'kay  
we have to find a solution and for that might be we can use uh direct show  
yeah mm  
'cause if we have to choose yeah  
so what i've been thinking is maybe if we try to really make sense together of the x. m. l. format to be sure that we can all produce the data that we are producing in a way or at least i mean i guess my data i'll probably load in from completely different way anyway because it's matrix  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
uh  
fancy fashion powerful easy to use  
ah <unk>  
um anyway okay um so kate <unk> what are your uh your thoughts on this  
very nice  
yeah  
well okay yeah  
<unk> just absorption per  
do you have more to your presentation  
mm-hmm  
everything we target is under forty so  
mm  
like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition  
perhaps soft touch uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged  
so maybe we should consider that  
and just about uh the user interface i came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control  
because staring <unk> without interruption blink or or <unk> is is an extremely short event  
uh what the 'cause i first statement i could not understand  
well that's not too what we want  
yeah  
i mean this is uh but please just tell me  
hmm  
it's easy to just tie it in if you just have it time stamped that just reference by words and stuff  
because it would be crazy yeah a little bit  
yeah  
so  
reading and yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
okay but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control  
and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department  
yeah  
but if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing  
uh destroying your elephant here  
okay great  
mm-hmm  
and obviously uh <unk> we very much hope that you get into that and you get excited and you do <unk> more and uh or uh maybe even different things  
so it's frustrated me in the past th that  
this is what we'll do  
okay  
mm  
good  
yes  
i mean you can't say of course it's always good because it's <unk> the likelihood of whatever  
hmm  
not i am not sure if i can get the right order and the values  
i'll see if i can find them  
no  
okay  
let me try it one more time  
you still have rubber <unk> or no  
i suppose that you this criteria is it  
they're <unk> as hell at the best of times and uh what can you say you got to love those qualities in an animal  
um  
so i wanted to combine the topic models that tell you beforehand what you think this page and this page are about with this to maybe get a better idea  
cover <unk> or something like that  
that's a so that's how to hire or how to interview is that that uh book  
micro <unk>  
because apparently i i will have serious problems okay  
yeah  
no  
oh plastic  
well  
yeah  
mm right  
<unk> you lose the banana you press a button and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana  
yep  
you have a dog at home  
but you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then  
but can there be uh <unk> can they work together  
or we get right into it or we completely steer away from it do you know what i mean  
yeah  
si it's got a curve to it  
um we'll double we'll double check and re install on software on the on the um eye tracking machines  
um piloting piloting piloting  
uh <unk> yes  
uh yeah if i can pick up with all these bits and pieces hang on  
yep you're right  
i don't think volume or do you think volume would be  
and i think there are a lot of those uh things and people won't buy it any more  
it was your idea  
um  
a small one  
if you are saying oh yeah yeah we should  
sorry in speaker d. <unk> file  
tracking  
mm  
it's nothing <unk>  
there's i mean there's hub set a. is transcribed i think um in final form  
everybody's supposed to try out the <unk>  
yeah i agree  
uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly  
i schedule to to work on that from <unk>  
no no no it can it should be weeks  
but that's what we want  
maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions  
yeah  
it came off  
oh yeah it's true  
mm-hmm  
<unk> absorption  
oh sorry the mango the mango look  
i have uh one question  
looks okay let's say it's a pineapple now  
i mean if you're ever you know late 'cause of that it's not we'll find a way around it  
the <unk> you mean  
yeah  
um and we're to make a profit of fifty million that's <unk> uh can you do the <unk> and how many are we selling  
oh where is your  
does does he preserve within the feature vector the framing he's using finally  
hmm  
it is hard to lose  
uh maybe like this with the uh joy pad here  
you know like a sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one  
that's okay that we can do  
looks cool though  
yeah  
we're not terribly noisy i think it'll be fine  
but i still think i it it all t. v. <unk> in some ways support it i don't know  
'kay  
a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap basically you know  
yeah then that's that's the way you want it  
yeah  
okay  
that's pretty impressive  
i mean it it's like it's like two types no  
which seems to me fit fifteen frequency band which seems to me quite reasonable  
sure without titanium alloy it's going to be light  
okay  
the the card that we have on the table  
mm  
yeah  
well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing  
can you can meet them in africa i think  
i would think so  
uh hard worker  
okay  
so i got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little  
mm-hmm  
big reason is 'cause i'm allergic to most animals  
don't take up too much space  
i don't think it is  
mm-hmm  
okay yeah  
for drawings but not for personal notes  
and i have the feeling given the descriptions that you made  
okay  
yeah  
so uh the finance we looked  
power button stand by channel up and down  
okay  
well  
okay  
yeah but you ca this is just a beamer function  
um my name is dirk dirk <unk>  
um  
so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape  
uh so we used the pearson uh chi square uh test no  
um there are other things like um how to make it trendy which is i think uh um most uh <unk> uh <unk> uh role  
yeah i'm i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from i dunno one to twenty  
mm-hmm  
i dunno i guess you pay what ten ten quid for a remote  
hmm  
okay  
yeah and especially for making them so like different and  
uh th there's there's c. s. t. r. and um h. c. r. c.  
there's a user <unk> one and an engineering <unk> one which i will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be  
um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control  
that's definitely our uh  
well better uh well i don't know when he last looked at it  
oh  
nothing  
no no no i no no no no it's doesn't have to be that if if you use the latent representations or distribution over aspects  
present project discuss a little bit about it  
no that would be your telephone in with your television  
because sometimes people just read  
yeah  
just uh this just an improvement of the smart meeting room  
so um  
hmm  
or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where i usually find mine  
i'm thinking about uh the <unk> telephone uh telephone from uh siemens  
it very much is about making concessions unfortunately  
uh a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time  
yeah  
so  
whoops don't want that not yet  
or it could be also something like this uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control  
it's probably like in in the end probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the high most highly ranked phrase or key word because like for example for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title anywhere similar to introduction or something  
um then i will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan uh and we will have a discussion  
and when you try to erase this line <unk>  
roll it back and forth like that but with uh i don't know how you would hold a <unk> and  
you should just give it to  
you can  
we'll make it a morse code  
i still can't sleep with them in my room  
um you might it depends on what sort of staff member is it  
a long lasting battery  
and then we'll have the infrared l. e. d. source which sends the information to the main device  
how do you mean  
you got excel to count  
so i did for some even also  
and this appeared to be true also of <unk>  
mm  
i'm gonna open  
no  
the eighteen the next eighteen month plan great  
it's big it's strong so uh uh oh it's a little bit  
yeah otherwise all your yeah  
okay  
okay  
uh sorry  
right  
no no no  
and and we can  
yeah  
uh yes he's produced an another version that doesn't uh have the overlap problem  
sorry  
alright  
no no no first they'll give you a quotation  
welcome  
okay  
yeah  
handy  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
dog  
new ideas found so one or two  
titanium back plastic front  
so <unk>  
i don't know  
yeah  
yeah  
so we haven't basically we just haven't got a a rule for  
like there  
these are a few examples which we have to decide about  
however with trends it's always if there's it's now  
yeah  
yeah  
i find myself especially if i'm in a crowd of people looking really silly  
yeah  
we can look at that that factor also so yes  
so  
maybe maybe maybe  
right  
right okay  
mm-hmm  
um yeah  
yeah it was <unk> well it wasn't the <unk>  
i can't do that without a calculator  
yeah that's true  
<unk> lose it etcetera  
'kay so are we done with the this presentation  
or <unk> or or two and see this one gives you this and this <unk> and can't you know are they fundamentally incompatible  
right we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points  
d. v. tape free  
um so uh um ellen's still out of town right  
yeah  
i use twenty degree sectors  
groovy  
yes  
one here and here  
if you take a note of them and then i'll put them in in a minute  
mm-hmm  
so you can look at that and see what the parse trees look like  
yes  
oh okay  
you just cut down some trees  
okay  
can i not just uh  
<unk> oh she spelled cutest um with an i. so that that's just something i pointed out  
so yeah  
how much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire  
but you said it <unk> but you said it's more complicated because your segments aren't those segments exactly  
i don't know  
with bells on it  
small cobra  
want to sell to  
three three six eight eleven  
and if you find that in your <unk> <unk> clustering those two uh balls uh marbles happen to be in the same uh cluster  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
i mean it should just be a matter of changing one single method in it  
if it says it f. e. two line strength then we would mark it 'cause you're talking about the line of it rather than the <unk> element  
and then battery i think is where things get most exciting  
yep  
so if we shouldn't at all be worried about it's actually it's quite beautiful  
you have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report  
yeah the the voice of course the voice recorder is uh at the bottom  
well um i wouldn't de be using the star so liberally um for a non native speaker  
mm-hmm  
also have to say did you receive the email about the voice recognition  
i think i th i would i would think the put the buttons but if if you have other mm proposals um  
<unk> so at the moment i've hard coded it to just um taking one tenth of the number of utterances which were in the original selection  
yeah just remo  
okay  
yeah  
i know but we couldn't use that feature so i missed it  
yeah  
oh yeah  
what it really is is a v. and what it you think it is is down because the down arrow  
ye  
but um  
okay  
right  
might be  
well luckily we are going to find out  
the mute button  
just go <unk> and it will activate  
yeah but i think i think two  
and a last question that is related <unk> uh our last if i not find another one um  
a. or  
those are the technological colours actually so it <unk>  
thank you  
alright  
so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw  
so  
because uh so so olivier says it's not before january on his side  
i see you later  
so i think it should be have less or <unk> very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things  
mm-hmm  
it would be very nice  
yeah  
it's a real real great thing  
i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on  
from <unk> memory  
yeah  
arrow yeah  
so it just helps me summarize them  
okay  
um don't know how lo much longer we've got  
okay  
yeah and basically uh as far as methods i was i was looking looking at  
annoying alarm or something  
uh i don't know  
<unk> <unk> or just two things which can be put on each other  
mm  
is it  
um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control  
i think it's difficult  
yeah  
for jasmine and vera  
because they they have other means of finding their information  
well i'd i tend to disagree with you on that because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this  
that's true  
okay  
okay  
oh yeah  
okay so you have a window and then you split it to <unk> two parts and you shift the the point where you split it or okay  
yeah  
yeah  
no need for teletext  
i mean  
i have no idea  
pushed up the agenda  
uh but i see this two completely <unk> <unk> like i see each <unk> each group is completely separate amount of data that shouldn't  
mm  
um okay just um the decision of the power button  
oh yeah  
for all those fruit lovers out there  
that would be easier  
okay well <unk> maybe  
sorry guys  
there's there's not much specific specific information but i think that um one indication of infra red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices  
yeah  
uh standard universal remote control  
mm-hmm  
oh well  
yikes  
yes that's true  
we could at least <unk> uh make it like this like you said and then tell them okay  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
never mind the coffee grind  
<unk> yes we uh we can have lunch now  
well this would avoid l. c. d. then  
they were they were just fine  
<unk> you'd <unk> i mean the uh i mean it so i mean have you been doing other things then  
well well done everybody  
um  
okay but what are the this is yellow  
we'll see each other in uh thirty minutes  
yeah  
the idea is if we can provide a feedback to people working together uh it may help them self regulating their activity their collaboration  
yeah it's a good idea  
i did not like it very much but  
two  
i <unk>  
okay  
yeah  
drawing  
mm  
that that's what you need anyway  
alright  
in a way we could send out that first call to them just as part of the same email  
okay  
but if you use uh silver uh rubber <unk> silver rubber isn't fancy  
and they have it sort of <unk> or in different concept that that  
uh uh i would add  
more or less  
did we decide what that was which button it was  
hmm  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
mm  
my slides were all blank they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty  
true  
um  
there's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this  
do you want to go first  
uh and you you could you could use normal light but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something  
exactly  
then you'd have to have an off <unk> off key  
right  
no teletext buttons  
i think it's  
that's it  
yeah  
i <unk>  
mm-hmm  
or output signal like  
so yeah  
and uh  
i guess at the moment nobody critically depends on like the nite x. m. l. stuff working right now right  
yeah  
so your n. starts yep yep i see what you mean  
that's a very important uh thing  
yeah  
black colours  
too much for twelve and a half  
okay  
are we leaning towards the potato  
being just hitting um the <unk> the boundaries on on both ends and just being at some points just black segments  
and i even i even <unk>  
mm-hmm  
it's a pineapple remote controls  
yeah  
okay  
you're right star forming galaxies are distinct  
that that one which is trying to approximate that energy in some low band  
yeah  
yeah  
yep  
so maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button  
so the interface is mainly while it's running just working on data that's just loaded from a file i guess  
i think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway because that seems to be what the people want  
with um this one  
i'm into it  
that would be two curves  
yeah but you can save it <unk> the under another name  
and then you have  
no  
okay tim  
okay um i ha i have one point <unk> um which which comes in mind now  
the volume settings  
the ten digits  
mm-hmm  
but that's with the l. c. d. uh screen  
the chip we're going for an advanced chip on print  
yeah  
so that's four million of them  
yeah  
i mean  
yeah  
okay  
and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price  
so mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that  
no we must save this thing yeah  
mm  
mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about  
yeah  
maybe we can do it uh together  
it's just button  
yes a  
and that's why you get these values uh which are random  
um other side  
yeah  
if if there is uh more than one person who is watching t. v. the <unk> well the the speech uh <unk> <unk> should be able to distinguish between the two  
okay  
i don't know  
so uh that's why i like them  
mm well that's compared to some other animals like cats  
um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device i do i don't remember you call it  
yes we are  
and i'll <unk> uh yeah  
so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget there's no doubt about that  
yeah that's what i something i have to look into  
well i don't know if all of this low level stuff would allow you to track that kind of thing  
ah of course how to to design this uh this yeah  
it's is uh  
marketing expert okay  
alright  
well i guess plastic and coated in rubber  
yeah i think it should be in there  
um  
oh okay there's preservatives involved we don't need to worry okay  
cool  
<unk>  
for example if you take uh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i think uh <unk>  
because maybe a <unk> is fancy for some people but maybe simple and uh uniform <unk> is fancy for some for other peoples so  
or before that  
it's a field programmable gateway arrays  
we need it for um the online demo  
no the back  
<unk>  
okay  
i dunno  
here's a uh so that answers your question about that answers your question about this one up here  
form  
to have different technologies  
yeah  
alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting the conceptual design meeting  
it's easy to use as well for younger as <unk> elderly people  
it's just for individual words  
it has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control  
but it seems to me it seems to me that ellen's concerns might mean we need to add more information to these tags because um  
maybe there is a supplement for that no  
yeah uh yeah uh yeah  
uh  
okay  
you'd been going a long time dividing that  
yeah  
oh no  
yeah or a <unk> <unk> front  
so i think it  
anything ending in object we don't include yep  
yeah  
because he will have this opportunity with or without  
yeah  
or  
it could well be but at a cost of  
and  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah yeah  
um  
but we're <unk> we're doing a more traditional <unk> <unk> frequency slices rather than temporal based stuff  
i meant just like handling two different files internally  
okay but  
mm-hmm  
mm  
which i which is hamed  
okay  
yeah  
uh  
you okay over there  
yeah well the that was just on my mind  
yeah  
as i uh as i said during my presentation fifty percent uh <unk>  
i don't know if that means like if i did a good job or something  
oh  
th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that  
um  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
they're one button but they kind of push up and down  
uh marketing expert uh have to go to product evaluation  
'kay  
i under i understand  
okay  
it is i so it sounds like you're not actually worried about the fact that this is the <unk> yeah  
can we go to the next presentation  
so we can easily look at things like that automatically  
that's right  
yeah  
good  
um so my name is <unk>  
uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page  
so and so it's still stuck with thirteen so i had to take out the special colour i suppose  
but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the  
they're funny  
so it's very  
i guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour  
genetically modified mushroom i will say but keep on speaking  
that's included  
but it's <unk> so you're mostly settling uh settling for for the uh solution where you mark all contacts individually  
but it a <unk> feature in the quasar the lyman alpha forest  
for hilbert envelope  
and then also 'cause it's x. m. l. file we can then do x. s. l. t. or whatever on to it to get extract whatever bits of data you need for yeah  
you could <unk> we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things  
and with a <unk> um function also  
well it might be the case that to be interactive there have to be dialogue acts of some specific type in a turn rather than  
i think we could probably leave that 'til later on then  
when i draw here it oh  
but uh it's it's an they're they're not putting technologies on this but if it if it was impossible to  
<unk>  
um whether they would figure the the <unk> uh sample senor and the sample speaker voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have  
seventy six point three percent  
perhaps you could find something in the middle  
hmm  
right  
okay  
or we we ask our personal coach  
for volume  
maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah  
oh yeah of course  
okay okay  
right  
thank you  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
but otherwise yeah i'm done  
that's true  
well that's great  
yeah  
yeah  
alright  
mm  
yeah not too much buttons and  
okay and if you disable speech recognition system then  
yeah  
oh good  
okay  
just in europe  
no  
i'm just thinking of some thing  
mm yeah  
could you go next slide  
<unk> come up  
yeah  
well <unk> <unk>  
that's difficult  
one and a half euros  
it does  
just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails  
okay  
who  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
it depends on the size  
okay  
so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television so that option is not uh optional for those uh people  
your stereo and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well maybe  
i don't know  
mm  
mm-hmm  
in house  
this is dreadful  
no  
this is jog wheel  
yeah you don't know how much it costs  
on the on the left okay so easy to turn on <unk> and off  
which one was it  
mm-hmm  
but again from a marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market  
did you wanna see  
mm-hmm  
because uh for example sony television uh has the opportunity to <unk> to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext  
okay when we talk about uh components design  
no i wouldn't say so  
profit target  
it it it was a  
okay  
eight eight  
now assuming you have done this for each time  
'kay  
when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels  
yeah  
we're gonna be competitive and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche  
uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah  
or maybe deeper <unk> things but that but you know  
yeah well the graphic display will definitely have more information  
um  
uh-huh  
uh <unk> we should fill this in now  
and then use those functions to generate the stuff that goes into the x. m. l. file the the g. f. format  
and on the other side uh just <unk> uh regular television  
mm  
yeah i think we <unk> we need to they're both yellow with black buttons it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that  
so i think when people  
'cause that seems a little more useful  
my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh  
okay yeah  
yeah  
first question  
so that could be done by l. c. d. display  
well i i'm not really bothering  
oh  
hmm  
there are  
that's okay  
you go back to prague for a while  
mm  
i design the user <unk> user interface you design the function  
yeah it's our yeah  
it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's <unk> and scroll wheel and l. c. d. display so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have  
we <unk> go straight to the semantics of the yep  
we're trying to sell four million of 'em um that's that's you know that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is  
it's gonna have an interpretation like this  
and my son reminded me that he ca hasn't been able to find his <unk> set in a while  
that's a very good idea um  
but uh maybe thinking of that it's considering the nature of the device  
you can have an l. c. d. screen  
right  
so  
it's a little bit uh i lost it the computer uh crashed so  
yeah  
so just think of um the <unk>  
so you want to send steve the prototype and we should change data  
throw some light on that  
uh market share speaker re speech recognition  
i can give you that to click on  
right  
so i'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing  
maybe <unk>  
yeah <unk> well now the <unk> the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully <unk> we could possibly do away with all buttons  
yeah  
okay thank you  
i don't know  
yeah  
let's see what more i have to tell you  
so um yeah he will always have that band width  
well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber  
well i think that's a <unk> there's a big market for it because uh you yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah but you could uh i thin uh there's a possibility to <unk> uh to uh  
we were including <unk> including broad line <unk> non broad line <unk> as well  
mm-hmm  
okay so you had this list at start  
eventually  
yeah  
it's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa  
no a wheel is better  
don't think so  
so if we're um the functional design you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other  
mm-hmm  
so we <unk> barely used it  
it i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair  
mm it looks like small room compared to the other three <unk>  
it's totally fashionable  
but don't stick yourself on the cover because  
oh they yeah  
so so what well last time we we were <unk> talking about what about <unk>  
and if you can get it all out of the speech you know if the if all of the <unk> is available when there is speech  
for for these two we can use titanium wood rubber or plastic  
partial  
yeah it's right  
there is um components  
but it was mm so this  
yeah  
what if not  
yeah so it's some kind of threshold that is set okay  
ten sixteen  
not going to work  
um yes i come to that uh uh  
but we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet  
the scroll scroll wheel  
oh yeah doesn't look so fine  
powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition  
okay  
yes you have televisions then you have to you know you have to uh press  
well  
i mean oh okay <unk> well if you want to see it in more details i mean  
mm  
yeah it's i would uh if you're <unk> if you're quite certain then i would go ahead and um type what you think it was said  
um basically i've been doing a little bit of web based research and if i had a design team i would've been discussing my ideas with 'em  
yeah  
well if you <unk>  
you know the other thing i thought about was you know do we go to something like this  
in industrial designer user interface designer and um  
true  
uh  
and it said uh five minutes so we got four and a half  
yeah you just preserve something different little bit  
uh or we'll see what what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation  
because most people find also hard to to find the remote control  
it's got to so maybe so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a <unk> similar vein perhaps  
so the theory can handle the kinds of things that happen in meetings as she explained  
so  
are there excess buttons  
mm see 'cause uh so far i'm <unk> still looking for a uh so called principal scheme for the interaction uh for the interaction  
double curved  
when it has an l. c. d. screen  
then if we have for the individual topic segments within the meetings if we have ready calculated <unk> um measures  
mm-hmm  
did it point out what to use them for  
ah it's above it's above the budget  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah but this  
mm-hmm  
up  
yeah that seems pretty straight forward  
i think just the segments as they're segmented in the for example in the point se point six five  
but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and <unk>  
some of this was presented in at least the one spider phone or the second spider phone <unk> i went to for work package six  
it sounds like l. p. c. when you excited by noise  
uh  
no it's multiplying them and and like putting them one over the power of something and the other over minus one one minus the power of something  
uh so i think we have a lot we have to take decision today  
because she has to break for some time at least a little  
uh second  
yeah  
i don't know  
alright  
ninja homer  
yeah  
i think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons yeah  
something that is more programmable  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
leave the unknowns the um ambiguities the uncertainties uncertainties until later  
yeah  
freak  
mm-hmm  
more like this colour  
i don't know  
alright  
and a lot of these buttons don't appear here  
ooh  
<unk>  
right okay  
so that's why i didn't play with that so <unk> more because i found there are more uh disadvantages than the advantages this approach  
uh you're right there  
so he didn't have to think about how much  
alright  
yeah we should change that  
original  
with logo and  
mm-hmm  
yeah sure  
just the on and off  
but we i think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also  
yeah and we could make an a a separate menu on the l. c. d. uh screen for teletext  
yeah i think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours  
of course we have uh a young target group  
yes  
uh which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual sort of  
and um just go creative  
and then  
yeah well but then i will have the problem to find the optimum amount of context  
nice  
yeah  
um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty  
uh the amount of money to spend um what they like in design uh and material nowadays  
'cause i'm gonna copy that stuff over  
true  
but i suppose nine's not really excessive  
uh this is the agenda for today  
yeah that's fine  
i don't see any new messages  
speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you  
then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh <unk> how much we are over budget  
mm-hmm  
okay  
because for instance we could probably you know  
so you better check that with 'em right  
like we only want the basic things that to be visible and the rest of them we try to hide  
we'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include let's um wrap up this one and i'm gonna go back to my <unk>  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
<unk> 'cause so it's okay  
yeah  
i've said single curved  
um not sure of how long we've got uh  
oh right yeah  
even if you just like if you have segments where where lots of rare words occur highlighted in darker red than segments where all the very common words occur  
okay  
um  
yep  
no advanced chip uh that's a little bit of problem  
mm  
i think it feels good  
i forgot to keep track of the overall score like who wins and who lose  
i've never heard of that one before  
it yeah it's it's certainly it's it's worth mm-hmm  
fabulous  
so um just from from last time to recap we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no l. c. d. display no need for talk back  
but uh click it on off  
fill in just a  
ah may  
strength rather than  
but i i mean 'cause obviously you've gotta think towards what you know  
just lunch break and have more individual work after that so let's see what we let's see we  
what's a double curved one  
pad  
um  
sorry for uh component so  
yeah  
what's that  
i mean this doesn't contain any content  
i'll put the the minutes of every meeting i'll put them there too so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever  
three  
in our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people <unk> uh people do have preference for tho fancy <unk> uh <unk> remote controls which look and feel very good  
i think i missed a few they are  
okay  
not directly uh available  
like if you have an l. c. d. display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote  
okay  
well it went okay  
yeah  
i think that's one thing that um and i guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed  
this uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device  
or you could just split it into two blocks i suppose for now  
for up and down ma make it a circle on it because it  
yeah  
one month for the standard one with button  
like the the <unk> corpus isn't isn't one meeting series it's several meeting series with different people meeting for completely different things  
okay  
think about it myself but i thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class  
j. peg  
oh  
uh  
could be ugly but it's definitely fancy  
i will send you or we can you know  
yeah  
four million  
i mean  
i think  
yeah i'll go with five  
because we uh really aim uh at at young market and i think the way it looked uh <unk> uh totally in yellow  
yeah  
otherwise <unk> you ha you have a <unk> <unk> very normal uh thing like this  
yeah i think it uh from a marketing point of view it also has to look nice  
so then we would have to fit in more than just one where values um  
yeah  
that's the material the younger people want uh ain't it  
yeah  
yeah  
some people might say it  
yeah  
this one right there  
so for some part uh the interaction is very strong  
i dunno i'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about  
mm-hmm  
this one  
no  
oh and the power button we have also  
okay  
mm-hmm  
so do we have to be realistic within the budget or  
no  
yeah  
yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh  
um c. m. u. no  
okay  
i take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well  
if it was continuum <unk> you probably wouldn't it  
yeah so  
um  
yeah <unk> yellow incorporated yeah  
how to guarantee such performances is really hard  
um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them  
uh the latest trends are soft things you know like uh i said in my presentation  
the power  
that's all you've got at the moment or did you have anything more  
right  
this side this side this is how they count  
there is some problem it has got stuck somewhere  
so it works pretty well for that  
exactly  
it's quite daring to to use i think  
um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell  
so i just choose the category one and you reuse the same button for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want  
yeah  
and we're we're not doing well on it  
like any typo or any strange thing where they put two words together  
i have to remember these things  
uh dreaming  
so the in the case if it is dependent that would mean that certain words tend to appear during certain slides and that there is a correlation and uh then there will be uh a reason like for believing that uh this will work  
so it's it's uh it's all about strategy <unk>  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
um alright  
yeah  
right  
he must be <unk> one of a <unk> small population  
do sol solar panel things do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb  
uh personally i <unk> uh i think that in terms of trends these products are quite good like these products are in fruit shape  
uh well <unk>  
okay that's fine if he mentioned this to you that's quite nice  
um i hadn't thought of that  
they can be basically the shape of the cases they can be flat they can be curved with uh one sided  
mm  
well it's just good practice  
that's good  
that it that it looks like wood like something yeah  
you don't feel free to answer this  
okay so um  
well it i wouldn't  
yeah well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it  
they are less interested in uh new features  
isn't it  
no  
yeah i'm  
yeah that's the same  
oh now i've put uh well it is twenty <unk> okay so we have ten minutes or something  
okay  
now it's twelve  
yes  
they just  
what are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices  
yeah  
i think uh the creativity uh was good enough  
right yeah yeah  
um okay closing  
yeah  
and should and should be red  
they're standard aren't they  
mm-hmm  
it is not uh something uh it's no information i read about it or so but it's just from  
an interesting day all in all i would say  
yeah  
then it has to be in there  
well uh  
yeah  
'kay  
yeah  
and sort of so that <unk> using the same data <unk>  
because these are basically the functions you use the most  
i don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them that pretty much sums it up  
and um  
no  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well look at the costs at this point  
oh sorry  
yeah  
okay  
um we <unk> the four of us are going to do that um together  
and when we're using that <unk> remote and if we misplace somewhere in the charger we have a small button  
but it is true that intuitively uh as we are driven in our attention uh i mean in in our understanding we're pretty much driven by attention  
yeah  
it isn't  
i can see nothing  
it's like a deformed foot i dunno  
mm yeah that would be good  
project aim is a new remote control  
um that's all yeah  
and and this one has to be soft  
yeah  
well it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow and that's pretty much banana like  
these are requirement specification  
so then th th that would  
also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product  
i mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway  
and is  
to make  
mm-hmm  
i'm actually gonna use the  
mm  
two  
yeah  
you we can  
so i think there is quite a lot of space here to uh switch a little bit among the people just to make some kind of smooth occupancy rate  
oh it's also more attractive  
mm i don't i dunno i don't think that's  
you are charging the batteries and um i'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though  
yeah  
yeah  
sounds  
yeah maybe not  
yeah  
mm six for me also  
we we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever  
okay  
what do we scrap  
but  
i think it does  
and it's  
uh for the product  
no no you say five he is the outlier  
hmm  
and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh  
yeah i don't know  
yeah  
and um you know there's stuff to learn there  
and uh regular chip supports speaker support so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced  
i would have have hoped to um  
mm-hmm  
oh there he is  
just a moment  
mm yeah  
okay that's good point  
but then how would you point it  
yeah  
yes  
on the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents  
yeah  
yeah i think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add  
yeah  
it's not it's not easy definitely  
they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here  
all in all it's kinda interesting  
i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a  
of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough developed enough  
beep beep beep  
m. i. z.  
some  
and so now that we've we have a prototype uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle  
and that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know fabian told us that <unk> you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the real reaction company  
so this is this falls down completely if <unk> can't run x. fig  
yeah but flat  
and it's not uh very <unk> uh technology  
yeah if if everybody in the house <unk> to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something  
mm-hmm  
another point of making it a two in one kind of thing  
t. v. remote control  
yeah i can  
it it has to <unk> <unk> one as there could still come more  
oh i was just gonna say <unk> maybe it <unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
well <unk> just <unk> you get a <unk> a normal front with it but you can change them uh when you buy the  
there are moment that actually this is the support because the people describe et cetera  
alright  
uh the volume uh  
okay well you got it's a <unk>  
yeah  
okay and the number of sectors is uh is not dependent of uh the number of microphones  
okay good  
maybe just bring it out in different colours but not <unk> that you can switch fronts afterwards that's also too much  
if you right click on it you can  
so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then  
i know a couple of people with cars  
this is coarse this is fine  
and you  
okay right  
mm  
hmm  
i know i yeah you could think of an <unk>  
yeah it still has a strong look  
okay uh  
okay so let's keep the reading room  
but you have to programme it yourself i suppose with your own voice  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
dash  
from the board um well  
component  
and uh uh so when different conditions are trigger are detected we trigger on the interaction event  
huh  
that's great  
uh younger people have now sixteen till to twenty five age are <unk> eighty one percent interested in l. c. d. screen  
ah <unk> okay  
but then it will be  
wait until i tell them i'm not coming back  
it's nice  
um then you could put a screen like on a mobile phone also on top i guess  
yeah  
oh we marked the same lines  
um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red <unk> the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through  
mm 'kay  
because remote is going to have both the interfaces scroll as well as buttons  
right let's see it  
so this is not this is not for free or something  
uh i have colour already  
uh maybe it with the kinetic thing i think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing  
it should be able to do any remote  
marketing  
yeah  
yeah that's beautiful  
and do we want them in different colours or  
so i'll  
okay  
so go on uh artist  
but the curves all <unk> over hand is it  
spongy 'kay  
i think she's listening  
well yeah the the idea of it was is that because you close it you cover the l. c. d. screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever  
so if you have to bow out let us know as soon as you know when you you're gonna have to stop  
maybe the holder if we were to have a holder it could be shaped like a fruit  
yeah  
did i uh did i break it  
that's sort of like an idea there  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
which i guess you have to do  
uh yeah  
well the the idea of the touch screen is uh  
well the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah  
so let's set the the latest deadline  
okay  
um and you can see on the left it's got a lot more buttons  
that is a separate thing  
mm-hmm  
so  
but the fruits and vegetables they really my creativity so  
in addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote we're going to have to have multiples of each type  
um  
i see mm  
yeah  
good  
yeah actually if you've got a lot of channels the number keypad can be quite annoying as well  
okay  
um  
i need that cable  
yeah mm true again but if it's without any without any uh <unk> price informations that's uh difficult to uh  
but fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control  
so we are here for the concept design meeting  
that i think that's good yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so  
oh  
yeah  
one's high ish isn't it  
um but a good number of them are first years and i don't know i mean just to get an idea are you planning on talking  
yeah but  
and if i'm coming in with a with with twenty five euros which is mid market price um then what am i going to give these people for this  
i can send you a <unk>  
yeah i see what you mean uh-huh  
twelve point five is our limit  
like like you drew here  
yeah  
the chip on print  
so so it <unk> uh it might be bad for then for the back end it might screw up the the <unk> speech rate or <unk>  
go rubber the whole way  
mm  
redesign  
is that everything  
so it uh the line's turning to into sines right  
and and the and the buttons that you need to control it i guess  
yes computer too yes to uh but okay  
yeah  
it's yeah  
oh right  
you press one and then you go to channel one and then two then you'd just go to channel two instead of twelve  
uh  
yep  
um  
in the in the design  
uh but um i don't know if if if well i'm coming back to the costs again  
two  
could evaluate the  
i don't know how you do that so who knows how you do that  
i'll just put it in there  
no but now <unk> <unk> would we have to choose a  
that's a freebie  
the the board and uh <unk> and word and stuff like that  
yeah  
yeah  
different colours maybe  
the command line interface yeah  
that might be sales who are not in this meeting  
you know you can't you can't have all three  
yeah  
yeah  
okay yeah  
um speak about <unk> the project  
yeah  
and the costs will increase a lot more  
it's no matter  
no i don't think you have to do it like  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
so that that's roughly what the model is plus other little bits  
yeah  
okay  
okay so  
which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing including m. p. three players uh  
yeah  
a specific uh remote control has a specific <unk>  
mm-hmm  
consensus on the what we're gonna do  
the current trend which was <unk> the functional look and feel  
uh  
<unk> um yes take it out  
but then you're <unk> yeah but then you'll lose function <unk> yeah functionality and our fancy uh look so  
<unk>  
yeah  
top  
yep  
right  
the fruity kind of round 'kay  
yeah  
ah it's it okay it's a <unk> on the c. it's a file okay  
most of the words you use most of the words you use are not really correlated to that  
maybe that was <unk> <unk> uh  
yeah the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium and has the titanium colour of course the look  
nice one  
uh yeah yeah yeah  
uh some other line uh width uh  
you have to empty one huh  
right  
and uh i don't know perhaps uh perhaps if you have two people speaking uh speaking uh at the same time  
right  
like titanium is cool but it's expensive  
okay  
we have so few functions so yeah  
so  
but i don't see anything i don't see anything on my computer now  
although similar but have something just slightly better  
uh oh danger sign  
approaches  
i'll go next  
no that's not <unk> sure so uh we need a display  
yeah  
um the the the problem with existing remote controls we felt was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better  
we have a we have a  
yeah  
yeah  
um well fancy stands for an original look and feel of the case and the interface  
mm  
mm-hmm  
uh perhaps it's better to have a x. array yeah  
but you can still ta you can still track what parts went into it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
could look like a fruit bowl  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh it's pretty cheap twenty five euros  
kendra  
but it's  
no but it's information that we theoretically have  
you have to grab it  
and i don't <unk> think it's obvious and natural how it would be used  
oh you have to start  
and then at that point <unk> uh you detect something like that and then you show something like uh what you are saying that i if there is uh if uh there i if it is out of discussion  
you know a panasonic product  
yeah  
yeah  
ah okay  
and we can we can steal their ideas  
quite easy if you uh do have any questions just <unk> ask me  
so what do we do with the extra profits  
yeah  
so uh now it's the hi sammy  
bright citrus colours yeah  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
no maybe the shift <unk> stuck in  
yeah  
an extra possibility  
no no no  
than just speaking  
oh  
but you know the next the next escalation is saying no we really need to talk about this  
se no no no  
thank you very much  
oxygen shouldn't be there  
oh  
yeah  
and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery  
well  
because we  
it could be a meeting plus half a meeting from somewhere else  
are the costs within the budget  
with a rubber case right  
but when you are modeling hilbert envelope you don't necessarily want to fit only peaks  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so it's a three stage kind of thing  
you can point to it but can you point to a line peak velocity shift  
be a good idea  
yep  
uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design  
of course  
mm-hmm  
and the recognition network was wrong and you owe me money or whatever  
yo <unk> yeah  
there it's gonna be almost impossible to convey that to you  
um the child friendly yeah  
alright  
um we can sell them at twenty five euros  
mm-hmm  
i think it <unk> everything should be like that continuous in chronological order  
<unk> i don't know if it is done now but like  
you could just probably just um add the um final second time to the next meeting and so on and just put it all together  
but um  
yeah yeah yeah  
uh is it a touch screen by the way  
okay um what about the electronics here  
you know as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity  
user profile  
it doesn't do what i want it  
that's very natural  
in the base  
yeah  
well i <unk> i think it's probably more than  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah  
mm yep  
and and we we we we we we don't want that  
so um  
<unk>  
well eight  
mm-hmm  
alright  
divided by four  
so you design the basic function menu for the l. c. d. screen  
um well i guess just from my findings it looks like we wanna <unk> buttons  
just uh just uh okay just a minute  
yeah  
no no no  
alright  
or or you can say for example um  
i have to talk to you about these  
of the fixation  
yeah okay  
to find him  
whoop no  
so uh no input from the television  
great  
uh didn't did we inc uh include the <unk> digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition  
a swordfish  
yeah  
alright  
yeah  
yeah and uh that that would be cool  
oh easy  
uh and uh i think to keep in mind  
which is what we can get onto now  
um cool so any last things before we break  
yeah  
yeah  
mm okay this is <unk> okay  
hmm  
what we can and cannot do  
transfer our <unk> our paper notes onto the uh  
um we will have the presentations of <unk> of you different team members and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented  
mm  
mm yeah  
some alternative just in case something went wrong  
no  
everywhere  
um but first of all we i'd like to uh introduce you to this room  
probably yes  
yeah let's see if it sells  
mm  
scaling  
mm-hmm  
i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting  
uh not important they found the audio uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch or the left or right  
oh my i'm sorry  
well uh they they didn't think of the requirements  
uh-huh  
channel programming  
hmm  
i don't need for for compression you basically don't need the  
yeah they do some kind of reconstruction of speech  
it appears to me that rainbow was made for something quite different  
actually yeah i we  
okay  
i mean it still seems definitely fit that <unk> so that's like if that's the new age kind of um <unk> innovative  
the remote  
but you can put them under the same button  
okay  
uh next slide please  
right  
mm-hmm  
it would just be a little speaker on the back or something  
i'm sorry  
lower than forty years i think  
is that if it came with maybe a holder  
'cause they eat she ate it  
it's magic  
i'm not sure if the if for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty <unk> manufacturing cost  
and the shape there's two basic shape  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
oh  
yeah  
um i think <unk> carrying on from what i've already said a user friendly remote with minimum buttons  
to make it just between the twelve euro fifty um then i  
so he's very rigorous uh as opposed to <unk> to me for instance  
so you think it's will be better to have a <unk> kinda total touch screen  
sixteen  
we've got uh various other things you could have and we're not going for these options  
mm-hmm  
yeah this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other  
that's stereo  
yeah  
um so i would give it a two  
yeah  
uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and  
okay so fewer buttons maybe would be good  
it's yeah okay right  
wow  
oh sorry maybe i should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
nope  
once you have the finished product i'll find a way to sell it  
why you go  
gosh  
right okay  
i'm not sure  
<unk> i think <unk> <unk> would we're trying to get to twenty five thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said  
yes a plain simple clean design  
and that's at the bottom of it  
okay yeah so if robert  
i mean a remote control isn't the most um  
those new ones  
mm because if you know the words that are spoken you can let's say uh someone say uh he's angry uh about the word he's seen  
yeah  
and then we can put them in a block at one time  
no mainly because of uh m. f. c. c. computation because yeah it becomes really noisy like if you <unk> yeah  
yeah  
that's got a lot to do with the ergonomics  
mm  
radical  
um they they didn't match the operating <unk> of the user that is you know the the way users use remote controls when they're watching t. v.  
'kay well we're gonna wrap this up  
yeah  
the the second claim that you put  
and apart of uh native english speakers we have a very limited vocabulary in general  
mm-hmm  
i mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on  
mm  
i think possibly it might be more useful if kate went next  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh programmable speech uh  
yeah  
yeah it's okay  
uh well as you know uh generally <unk> are estimated using uh neural networks and more specifically m. l. p. <unk> in a speech recognition system  
the l. e. d.  
yeah normally it could it could go faster  
'cause that's two parts for you  
mm-hmm  
right and the corporate image was the uh final thing  
but it's very difficult to to draw that in yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's not so then it's bit tricky  
doesn't say so  
yeah sure  
yeah of course  
does it  
um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote  
<unk> type company then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is <unk> quite high up on  
yeah then wider up here  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
yeah i'd i'd certainly support that idea  
so you have to  
so each component represents one function but i think the basic functions are the logic the transmitter  
yeah but well okay  
two  
i mean i i i'd you know it's unfortunate for him and for us 'cause it's really gonna be a nightmare to transcribe  
whatever you think is good  
so so ease of use is important but technology is twice as important  
right yeah  
um eighty <unk> eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy  
i mean what you do is you just build an x. m. l. file and if you want it to get down to the utterances you'd go to the leaves  
the  
<unk> you've got the  
yeah  
mm  
yes  
you don't know  
yeah  
it's better than before  
i thought it could be for for voice like i dunno it mm like on a um i like it used to be on <unk> or something  
we're  
<unk> chance  
so we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age  
yeah i like that  
on the l. c. d. screen  
yeah  
so what does the screen do  
but  
i know  
yeah i can directly put it into uh just like  
no  
okay and i think we should use the company colours  
well a power button  
of course  
it's definitely not linear because you're looking at a maximum energy in a frequency kind of  
um and on that basis um i i think we we need to bear that in mind  
mm-hmm  
although the <unk> toggle  
i don't think if we if we even use an l. c. d. screen we need to definitely  
to scan <unk> all the user  
make it a piece of furniture  
yeah i  
'kay criteria four is costs  
it is yeah  
um what are we doing for <unk> otherwise  
yeah  
hmm  
we're getting paid  
this not uh <unk> programme  
i um  
and <unk> i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well don't you  
no no  
i'm pretty sure they didn't have induction in my day  
i just <unk> i don't i think uh yeah it's i think it's grey regular  
um  
i <unk> in this past one we we didn't have much we just wanted to get a little brain storming done  
who's lost or broken their their remote  
mm  
something different and we want we want that  
oh wow  
if you put them all black it's not really that good a contrast  
yeah he said they're quite sparse  
okay good  
absorption components don't count  
yeah that you don't use half of them  
i can't true or false  
so it i like things kinda tidy  
yeah  
it can't co you cannot convince me  
really  
yeah yeah that would be uh an idea  
so yeah it's just gonna be just gonna be push buttons  
got a lot of re responses and we asked some very specific questions and we got a lot of good feedback  
no  
so this is uh  
because when you put your <unk> yeah but if yo if you make the the l. c. d. screen as large as the remote control itself  
if you if you're confident that you've got a fair grasp on french for example why not  
yeah  
not really  
um but <unk> but uh you can still get a like you get th um basically if you do phase unwrapping and all of these other tricks  
so  
but think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control in a way  
yeah  
it's it's flat  
but we wouldn't say absorbers were a type of source  
probably where you'd want to have the battery as well  
um  
wait  
oh  
okay  
okay great  
so if you wanna control the screen <unk> <unk> sharpness you just say sharpness and then you <unk> turn you just press <unk> increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel  
okay and the feel of the material has to be spongy  
cheers  
morning  
mm-hmm  
it was  
what more  
well if i look at it the side the side view  
yeah we yeah  
not to waste time that's important  
and there's nothing else as far as i can see that we we had uh planned to put on  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
so  
the extra functions  
wait <unk> from the linguistic side if you if you mark star burst before and if you feel that star bursts are like objects  
mm  
oh  
so i wouldn't do any any work to find out what'll output s. v. g.  
mm-hmm  
so we're suggesting doing a <unk> scroll wheel thing for the volume  
alright that's okay  
yeah yeah uh <unk> i think some i think it's good idea yeah  
right well we made three different prototypes and i guess we'll start with with this one  
yeah  
it you  
yeah  
i mean well what kinds of  
make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group but isn't that bad for an older person either  
yeah i think i was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause i liked the pen yeah  
but you reckon that i i mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries  
got very few buttons on it and  
so  
mm  
but actually it's not what happens  
you can use like uh a <unk> sided or you could use a  
yeah  
add add the structure yeah  
if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them  
you you we have that because you uh stored them  
that's what i was thinking yeah  
um and we'll evaluate as to whether we've <unk> done what we set out to do  
yeah  
it is  
ah  
one time please  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
good morning again  
okay okay  
wait a sec  
okay well i mean the obvious one is changing channels  
we we've not been including extended emission  
so that's blue  
if we're coming from mice we can even add a click function where you in order to verify the information you just press it down  
usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different <unk> you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote  
yeah okay okay  
yeah  
the extra functions you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions  
yeah  
okay i i think um i just wanna put in as project manager the you know  
yep  
so so you know the g. d. f. stuff with so i ellen's view on this is we go through everything in order  
right  
since uh  
um so yeah  
uh-huh  
yeah  
it's really good like so  
we'll see  
like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing  
and and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working  
sort of like if basically if we have something like this segments file but for each of you like just have one attribute  
but that's common  
okay  
and you want to <unk> accentuate that you know  
mm  
so you can go to the direct uh <unk> central place and then <unk> uh  
so it's  
why not  
yeah  
and back to our <unk>  
yes  
also we have to work within the company constraints  
but uh we we  
within budget on that  
i'll show you the notes again  
with some casing around it yeah  
and you cannot use the red and green button  
under sixty five okay that's a good start  
oh okay  
okay  
what's this  
people want it  
well what about mute  
four  
yeah one group yeah  
yeah the speech feature  
so that's so that would hopefully help with grip or like the ergonomics of it  
okay  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
okay  
so  
okay  
i'll take the lunch  
no it's not much to work on  
that's not no  
okay and if there is th the conclusion now  
mm-hmm  
okay  
uh no no <unk> g. s. m. because they don't have g. s. m. in the u. s.  
okay  
so it won't be um uh too expensive to build it  
and we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need just basically every <unk> need 'em  
wireless uh wireless things  
uh not normally yeah  
okay cheers  
wonder if i can make this  
we changed th  
um easy to use oh okay let's forget that one  
yeah  
uh uh i i if it's it's a simple <unk>  
now that we've discussed okay  
so because i th i think it was cedric has already offered to do whatever we need him to do  
um so <unk> now and then um as the industrial designer  
okay  
but i don't think  
or yeah  
can i just interrupt  
yeah  
sorry carry on  
we have the <unk> advanced  
so there's a very important task for you  
we just couldn't not for twenty five euros so  
okay  
uh it's it's not <unk> a device that  
mm i'm not sure i  
yeah  
mm  
yeah well do you ha do you have to you haven't looked after the <unk> of l. c. d. displays have you  
we want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so  
um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board  
kind of um maybe more like a p. d. a. kind of just hand held like 'cause  
yes  
well it's just one script  
great  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
that could always be  
right  
and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes  
dual channel watch  
where you've written at et cetera is that how we're supposed to be writing it  
yeah  
yes  
it's and what you need is this envelope and this one carrier  
you guys know your stuff  
it <unk> they didn't say anything about what sort of information they'd want from the meeting itself  
yes  
there's also a watch moves around a great deal more  
yes  
logo okay  
sure  
and then and the power button  
yeah yeah right  
yeah  
like the th the start and the end position changes and the zoom level changes  
what is the expert of uh  
yeah  
design  
okay  
okay  
yeah but it i think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control  
okay  
but  
good  
five minutes in the meeting  
we've got an idea  
so that's <unk> <unk> would be making use of the l. c. d. screen  
um okay so very brief presentation um  
and most of these functions are not going to be used it creates a rather user unfriendly interface  
mm  
uh from meeting three is it alright with you if i don't switch it to show just use it as is  
so they can be heated and um and cooled and they change the shape of um the metal  
as you want yep  
well wait a second no it's it's double curved it's got a <unk> it's uh  
uh so that can be uh can be read out  
yes  
does it mean uh that  
i have nothing uh nothing to add i think  
and that's that's what uh the coffee breaks will be for and maybe <unk>  
i what in this project  
okay well i think the meeting will be over within a minute  
you feel like you're caged within whatever <unk> it's like a balloon in a cage it can only go so big and not hit the side  
yeah sure why no  
and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops  
if you know what i mean  
oh  
do each one in order  
<unk> <unk> four less euros  
i think it's possible  
um what we can do is well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy  
so is this like it's a subset of the v. l. b. a.  
be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary  
yep the it's just across there that's it  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
we'll just deliver it in black have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have  
yeah that's the problem  
mm-hmm  
uh is equal to and you can use the same sort of thing  
yeah two is pretty good  
so it's junior people but  
yeah  
so well we gonna do the next part  
that's  
we've but we have we have a solid booking for all the mornings anyway  
that's up to market if i if it's trendy  
but i dunno if that's too expensive  
no it is it is  
yeah  
i think that is just the um things that are loaded every time but we have lazy loading so it can load more than that  
but not too advanced  
we want something that you can find easily  
i think if we both step up and uh  
fresh  
menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition settings  
hmm  
no  
if it if this lying on your couch you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing  
but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements  
and also <unk>  
findings  
and so with that you can you can determine for example for a document <unk> of the set two to the most similar  
okay good yeah  
yeah  
well um the <unk> uh yeah the <unk> signal coming from the frame grabbing card  
it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche  
piece  
but  
morse code  
hmm  
it's perfect  
not not uh <unk> not way  
yeah yeah that user friendly or  
so rubber can only match with rubber  
yeah  
it's always fun to have something big and plastic around  
or you can use solar cells but i'm not sure about that indoors really but  
right  
yeah  
which doesn't really help me much  
try to get <unk> false starts  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
no uh it's  
yeah  
you know how much  
how complicated are we gonna go with the voice activated  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
so this is the same for both models  
<unk> well the let's say uh april o. six and uh we do uh our best with uh trying to keep you inform with the advancements  
why  
yeah  
so we are going for the for the <unk>  
um just like hand reading them in that one of the things i did was i started a i a web crawl at the <unk> <unk>  
now uh project eva evaluation  
and then yeah  
and button supplements well they're in diff special colours aren't they  
yeah  
yeah  
two  
and your favourite characteristics of that animal  
oh i see  
okay um i haven't seen it on that this kind of data  
mm and then  
mm-hmm  
so say power circuit here  
so we want something fancy as uh previously said <unk> something very easy to use powerful and also as uh it's written here  
to produce each one  
yeah plastic with special colour  
hmm  
nice  
so it's just <unk> graphical for the pointing aspect  
it's just amazing  
okay  
hey voila it sounds like you uh uh i mean obviously there's a lot more to it than that  
yeah  
voice recognition especially not could  
um <unk> yeah well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself  
or you can  
okay  
linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs  
do you wanna draw it on the board  
you can also have it maybe talking about mobile phones again sliding open  
i think it's  
um  
there you go  
uh  
people want to buy  
yeah  
the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties  
because it reads everything just from one file  
so um we want to to do a new remote control  
<unk>  
yes  
yes  
nice  
twenty eight  
oh sorry  
um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking  
mm  
and nothing's simpler really  
because of the you know it <unk> it gives something dynamic to the remote control  
like i can't think of an example but  
yeah  
hmm  
choose by contents or by channels  
or uh ma maybe a magnetic  
or just so you can configure the the location of all the files as an option  
then  
considering we have  
line ratio we weren't doing  
so anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um  
uh <unk> fine  
um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision  
and  
that's the entire history of these  
yes  
yeah i guess so  
right  
how how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends  
you got uh willing heads  
and optimization of the code and all that <unk> stuff  
and i'm andrew and i'm uh our marketing  
right yeah  
batteries  
mm  
but maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit it's just sort of naming it by a fruit  
okay  
but just to make things clear in the presentation to show more steps  
well i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around <unk> specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more  
right  
no  
yeah the problem is probably that um i extract all the words and then uh i don't um use an i. d. or something for it  
oh shoot forget that  
we use this  
'kay  
right  
so the stuff that's  
okay  
yeah like using the menu to be like enter your name into the screen like on the menu options  
sure  
yeah a combination  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know  
mm  
excellent  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
which is uh we put fashion of in electronics  
okay  
where would we want the uh teletext button  
mm-hmm  
so okay  
so we might use this one information for that  
<unk> well what about the the overall sum of the durations  
nah  
does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button  
we have battery right  
they have a a <unk> i can't remember off hand  
mm 'kay  
make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold you know things like that  
right right right  
very new thing  
i wanna see i wanna see one of them um look really nice before we start running subjects  
yeah  
okay three  
those are mechanisms  
well <unk> when we only use basic functions we have the possibility to make the buttons larger  
i don't know  
what do you think uh those those buttons  
black for sunday  
yeah  
i think l. c. d. <unk> more useful than speech what  
we have a technical problem uh  
i mean i i don't say well no no no  
really  
yeah  
so we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to sarah  
proposed idea  
um  
or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition  
the data on which we want to run the scripts is not there  
okay  
so you had to to to <unk> maybe the  
i can't imagine how how how it looks like  
yep  
yeah  
okay  
a wind up remote  
the infra red  
i mean i think had the issue been more serious we probably <unk> brainstormed more during our meetings as a team  
i think it's on the  
'cause we missed out  
i what we're doing about that either  
well i mean on a onto like a mouse the <unk> the <unk> button  
so that it would come up like that  
okay  
oh  
yeah yeah  
uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at  
you you got something for two haven't you  
yeah  
but  
oh  
so we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that  
it'll wear off  
mm-hmm i suppose <unk> one thing that could be done is <unk> is have it um circular and have it <unk> so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger  
project plan  
mm  
but if you have any <unk> other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly  
no no <unk> of between we can do but but then you have two parts of front two fronts that  
so so they have they have their utterances displayed in their interface  
okay  
then  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
is that did i  
like if somebody is talking very uh in a very energetic manner it might be quite fast  
construct one yeah  
okay so <unk> it it's not even as advanced as paint  
so do cats  
he saved them all ten  
right  
on a prototype drawing on the <unk>  
yeah well the same  
i'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so  
yeah good idea  
mm  
yes  
right okay  
but though with various  
that's adjustable  
it'd be more a command interface and then  
i think it's cool  
they have to bring it into play  
well it it's use especially useful i guess to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff  
so we don't need any of them  
so i think you know nobody's uh waiting for it  
as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well  
yeah  
basis station thank you  
yeah  
when you're at college  
um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss  
i think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high end product  
no but can we make yellow rubber  
so no  
pretty much  
display and the glow in the dark thing  
of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh  
so what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question  
yeah  
they're thinking  
yeah that's right  
it's not there  
uh they have like really <unk> many <unk> i guess  
like if it say it's a lit little vaguely <unk> type of thing it'd be easy to have a compartment in there  
so uh that means redesign  
any <unk> <unk> yeah  
yeah  
so we will be able to plug uh up to eight uh microphones with uh jack plugs to exhale air with the possibility of extending with eight more x. l. r. uh microphone with another box  
no i don't think so  
yeah i agree  
but i mean we know what they mean  
uh so if you want a copy again you'll have  
yeah  
true  
and now i don't have any posterior and uh probably the scripts generating that posterior so what i can do okay  
okay so what what shape are we making the standby button  
well i dunno  
hmm  
mm  
or one  
yeah  
i i think the special colour thing has to be uh marked  
just ask them look you know say we you need something that does s. v. g. and then um if they if they come back and say ha  
yeah i have still ten minutes to finish the report  
yeah kind of  
okay but they may need help finding the something if they can't do x. fig i suppose  
um and see how different they are from tree bank <unk>  
if you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more  
yeah  
yeah the younger people liked soft material  
that's a topic information  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
it goes over there  
this is one  
to fit  
okay  
zero point five seconds or something  
you don't because that's you'd have to have human coding to do that  
twelve point five milliseconds is kind of sift  
i probably have already opened it here  
yeah <unk> <unk> expensive but  
no we don't have the scroll  
um  
however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much  
cool  
no  
okay  
it could come  
we could put uh <unk> slash here and then a <unk> slash is the <unk> yeah it works  
so um  
yeah because if the product will be international  
okay yeah  
the the balance hmm  
where are we gonna have the slogan  
cool  
mm-hmm  
and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
and that's all  
so it's quite quick  
hmm  
or a find a finding function you know  
well intern during the summer you're very much handicapped  
like it's already kind of  
yeah  
so um that's really good like we've <unk> had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so  
but from a research perspective it's not interesting  
we put the fashion in electronics  
and soft material <unk> materials like the rubber  
so i i don't see any reason for having an l. c. d. 'cause it's an increased cost  
strong drop in the continuum  
yeah  
so maybe that could be incorporated as  
so it will have five point five average  
uh  
um i'm from leicester um second year  
alright  
so  
it doesn't  
three  
oh  
um and the total cost has been calculated as nine pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed  
standard rubber  
anyway i'm rambling on  
remote control has to have to have a low power usage because <unk> <unk>  
or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something  
good morning everybody  
uh hello again  
i think it could come in handy  
yeah  
and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three dimensional  
uh but so this actually basic the idea  
yeah  
well i i think <unk> after this meeting we can <unk> we can try together to regenerate this  
hmm  
uh  
so we <unk> you could quickly just through many channels  
mm  
it must be <unk>  
yeah but you have to <unk> just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy  
uh that's what we've just done  
fancy look and feel that's good  
yeah definitely  
and that's  
so my job is to uh design a google t. v. controller  
the age is going up uh  
so we <unk> it's like like some <unk>  
well very good  
let let let me see what's more what's more popular  
but i think if we wanna use standard components we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that  
with the more important functions on  
but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing so i think that there is some restriction on um  
uh well they also zap a lot  
mm-hmm  
you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh <unk> not what i wanted to do uh uh  
would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it  
okay  
so we're not gonna have the l. c. d. anymore and we'll just gonna have an on <unk> on the t. v. it'll show you what you're doing  
replacement but no superfluous so you can't have a a standard stock with extra parts that it'll never use  
or blue tongue  
i hated the cameras i hated the microphones  
but we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this  
uh yeah  
i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five  
yeah  
make that cute  
okay that's the end of the meeting  
there's no lapel system trained for instance  
so we have to think of something for that  
um  
sorry  
for example you have a sony t. v. and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a sony that won't for a philips t. v.  
nor i  
and on base of each <unk> uh criteria we need to um give a rating  
like a bart simpson <unk>  
yeah  
okay  
i'll give it a two  
so we've got four sevens so that's twenty eight three sixes eighteen  
maybe this  
drop everything  
yeah they were fun even though i'm not really sure what i could do with them but they are awesome  
okay  
so  
yeah  
uh and and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast  
even even <unk> several uh da buildings and all the computers in that building they all burned  
easy to use  
so have to <unk>  
yeah i understand  
is this supposed to be clipped as well  
um i would recommend i've found that it's easier when you're checking and you're trying to make sure the boundaries are right for a speech segment  
yeah  
<unk> a good idea  
i know but uh if everyone like if everyone is managing three pages for their bit then that's gonna be that that's a big report then  
very quickly  
maybe  
in fact i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves  
mm  
okay  
and adam we can keep that in  
yeah  
well we have got <unk> trendy further down but  
and you just took out the low red shifts  
mm  
that's alright  
yeah but can for for example can you use from some data from from the l. t. world  
i mean they worked i mean i know manny <unk> really well and they're not counters  
oh yeah  
round  
this isn't supposed to look like just  
yeah triple r.  
i mean we'd take a separate we'd look at the percentage time i mean i have no idea because i don't know how people look when they're building things together  
yeah i don't understand  
uh  
the only <unk> innovation is the shape  
okay  
mm  
here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum  
your problem  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yep  
mm-hmm  
<unk> um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button  
when really work combine these two or  
um sorry mark  
r. s. i. is like when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times then you get injured  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yeah  
and it is  
these are the <unk> regular remotes  
like what yeah  
when you look at this <unk> this <unk> uh item  
i got invited to a um a a a summer garden party for new staff members  
i'm not sure <unk> i'm not sure it's if it's expensive but just take a look at it because it might be a very good idea  
um  
so and if and we've gotta get to the end  
yeah  
yes i'll think of that too  
yeah yeah  
that'll <unk> that'll give us a starting point for us to sort to talk about it to look for what analysis we <unk> actually need to do on it and things  
you know what  
mm-hmm  
or is it okay  
okay  
p. yeah just a p.  
so if you use higher frequencies you can get more precise <unk>  
uh the in fact the the frame lengths will be uh very uh very uh i  
the arrow  
it's just uh <unk> you could try calling this person and see how this works  
<unk> so that's good  
we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars  
i'll <unk> still the same subjects  
so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip depending and maybe we could table that decision for later  
yeah  
well well will the will the will will do if the trains are <unk> as bad as today  
so ten centimetres in height  
i think that would uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing  
mm-hmm  
okay  
channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb so you can't have r. s. i. uh consequences  
okay  
uh probably like after today's meeting we then actually need to  
okay  
it would be nice for changing the volume but i don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel  
um  
yeah we have to have it  
yeah  
did you say command line  
it's the detail design meeting so we're going last meeting  
mm  
the sample sensor sample speaker  
uh  
so um and then the production evaluation as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture  
okay because what does it mean  
uh wood  
can you like i mean this may be too complicated but i wish i had something to explain it like if it was just a simple  
yeah  
okay everybody all set to start the meeting  
i'm ron  
yeah  
and a three  
you want an outside of rubber and then open it up and  
okay how you feel it is important that you're taking the context of the whole utterance  
okay  
mm  
<unk> <unk> kinetic  
so um  
um go away  
they're you know thumb masters  
and that's basically what we're gonna do  
no yeah that's a good point  
yeah  
the most expensive part is here  
well it it doesn't have to be red  
so it is useful yeah  
yes  
figure  
we're <unk> yeah  
and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just <unk> just to have like something written down  
a two  
yeah that's  
for instance yeah  
oh i see so we shouldn't really be  
so what about  
the battery and there are um switches and things like that  
yeah  
maybe i you could <unk> just do an an exit with okay  
if we would if we could remember like not too many buttons and make it look fancy i think it would make it  
yeah  
fifteen years  
it kind of <unk> it fits with <unk> fits with marketing um  
and we could do whatever we like with the l. l. c. d.  
euros  
um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh  
that's that's okay  
uh but i don't know so that is something i'll have to look into  
um  
i think the meeting  
yeah  
<unk>  
yeah  
you write an algorithm which which then goes back because they they're in the right order still and stuff right  
yeah but okay  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
when you exchange all the fronts and it's open  
alright  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
what's the price to <unk> to produce  
mm  
no this isn't right  
yes but olivier make it run on on these machines and make the uh cross the two g. barrier here at <unk>  
you know i if it's not that see you know  
yeah  
well basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume  
okay um uh what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in  
oh crap i forgot about that  
pop ups  
uh it it's yeah that yes um that's for the sort of gaze time measure  
there's uh i mean i don't see it anyway  
does it fit in with our other other products which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft  
so we're buying <unk> i mean we're getting futures in the company  
uh  
so that's no option  
oh right  
yeah  
look <unk> yeah  
narrow emission lines from high iron yeah  
yeah but there is one problem that uh <unk> talked about is the international  
so it's either one <unk> just just to get it <unk> just to get it through final it's either turned into plastic  
that could be good yeah  
i don't know  
<unk> mm okay  
so  
user interface designer uh <unk> i would like to see the user interface <unk> uh concept  
that's right  
right okay  
it's samsung some some new really new phone like mm  
yeah  
yeah nothing in the afternoon  
okay  
yeah  
speech recognition scores even higher huh  
<unk>  
so if i understood it right we have to count these numbers  
lights  
okay um finishing the meeting now  
so okay  
you know knowing the task right  
right  
so  
yeah  
yeah  
and you've got the <unk> and you can just talk at the  
yes what the market wishes  
but that's gonna then you <unk> then you don't  
yeah  
button supplement  
yeah and a transmitter  
it should be theoretically  
well that's pretty uh <unk>  
it was wireless too so  
no  
we go to the fruits and <unk> vegetables  
and fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times  
um and very simple but technologically advanced  
so in the middle or something  
they have got a  
clap clap clap it's a good i i think it's universal  
but actually this all here is n. l. s. s. d. because it was data a. that didn't fit on my um quota anymore  
and um reserve the possibility to add other features  
uh here is one you know  
one more  
so basically it might be interesting to have still um uh the <unk> uh the slide stream so that for instance if we detect there is a new video that is displayed also on  
um the two of you get to play with a <unk> <unk> clay um to do a prototype  
uh you talked about it before the colours grey and yellow  
but you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to  
you've got a choice there of going down to battery which would save you one  
and how many models do you need to completion  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but but we could we <unk> i think we should talk to barbara about how to do some joint experiments or or if she's gonna be sending other people  
like a button on a t. v. you can press and it'll ring or something i don't know like or beep  
this would be the actual grip  
um  
okay  
that's me  
no but it's it's laughter th throughout  
well it's yeah  
i thought so  
right  
so there the the the functionality is there but it's not it's not ideal and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there <unk> this button yeah alright  
okay  
even you have those three state perform <unk> also you have all these  
mm  
where uh are the lights  
um i have yes  
yeah  
yeah it looks uh pretty fancy  
uh then i'll have uh some kind of map and it's the top of the remote control  
sixteen euros  
okay  
it's single curved yeah  
yeah  
who would like to um follow that one up  
well okay  
and if there are a lot of words that um are typical for one category  
okay  
yeah okay  
or a little base station or something  
here we go  
excellent  
um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it  
uh it's  
you don't know where is the <unk> uh the <unk> the shot  
most t. v. <unk> have a menu  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
in one  
most true  
yeah yeah  
oh you're much taller than me so i'm gonna write down here  
move <unk> move the other spare place to the big room but then there's not a lot of people in there  
using the using the <unk> <unk> the power switch to switch on t. v. is a high relevance of nine but it's not frequently used  
mm-hmm  
i mean there's al there's also remote controls i remember that that worked uh  
which has had to be put to one side  
yeah this project is done with <unk> and <unk>  
hmm  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
okay  
you drew it a long time ago  
yeah  
next appearing <unk> up and down uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen  
if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more but it that's what you need if you want the l. c. d. display  
uh this i can point to a paper uh i don't think this is the right place to explain everything  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh it's fairly fairly standard  
which is technically the easiest option  
are you going to invite sponge bob maybe he can  
then i think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions  
mm-hmm  
now he's gone  
i'm i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that if you're asking me but  
okay  
you cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah we had falafel  
not related to the internet one that you mentioned because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do  
ah so you ha you you might have multiple colours  
we'll think <unk> we'll think  
no  
yeah instead of like hard buttons  
so this is where we could have uh  
sure okay right okay  
it could be be yeah you never know but  
the slogan uh  
yeah  
so like late eighties  
<unk>  
they're big selling items  
ah okay yeah  
very natural look  
there's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make  
yes  
and i will point you to all the code which i have  
okay  
to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand  
yeah  
so you you <unk> you found that dwarf amorphous blah blah galaxies that that's not a proper name  
whoa  
kind of looks like a penguin like with no eye  
we don't know it  
but they have like three backups in the university so all these people they didn't really affect much  
um so in conclusion we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy um has lots of <unk> tech technology in it  
so let's do that  
when you when you specify the molds in the in the in the <unk> the file that <unk> that generates the parts like a list of parts  
oh i think i've transcribed him and i had project at all um evolution criteria  
yeah  
well while you do that i'll be trained in how to hire people  
but anyway you don't really need hard decisions no  
probably the people technologically  
yeah  
so that's just my question but we can keep talking  
mm that would be good  
yeah it's from words  
durations are in there  
let's just throw that away and start again yeah  
oh okay  
i <unk> i saw that they used matrix <unk> on the l. p. uh on the l. s. f. parameters or whatever  
so it's a good evaluation i think  
for the the the call routing itself or the recognition uh the phoneme recognition  
or probably maybe less but not much less and actually the i think there doesn't have to be one in everything  
um <unk>  
true  
yeah basic <unk> over the p. of t. given d. so over all this uh empirical distribution  
oh  
grass green  
the ten digits  
mm  
vegetables  
wait wait <unk> i i thought the sol that a better solution was fixing this problem with the mono microphone socket  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
we put in type type one point nine  
oh so he's got ours left  
mm  
it'll be a developing of prototype  
so not some words the words in general  
bye bye  
have could have used a different  
mm  
mm  
we put the fashion in electronics but we couldn't because of the costs  
okay brilliant mm  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
yeah but you can <unk> you can zap <unk> you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh  
yeah like an  
although you know wood  
yeah it should remember banana but it's not doesn't have to <unk> to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana  
three  
uh <unk> <unk> uh did you use the pen a lot  
but i think like the two pages on the same screen like teletext and normal television that's that's nowadays standard i think  
or eight million  
yeah yeah  
you know the the symbols of the various functions  
very good  
okay so we wanna go for plastic or what would you recommend for materials  
i think it's still important to have it at the top because it's uh  
uh well first of all i've uh <unk> subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are <unk> <unk> um you know from what uh the remote control's formed  
no  
so you finding just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed and then it translate to the key  
because it might for for our design purposes i mean the lighting up thing might be better because glow in the dark material has a funny kinda colour  
you got simple designs <unk> we should put it to simple actions  
viewing times  
um maybe sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution because that's his his field of expertise  
right and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television  
notes of the of the last meeting  
and as long as i can test the script like once and it's working fine i can just make it return dummy stuff so it works on other machines  
pulses right  
getting access to the uh to the account  
okay  
ah yeah but that would have to be the temp directory off the machine you can s. s. h. into directory of s. s. h.  
yeah  
it has to do with fashion i guess  
so what if you if you if you get the results from that software and you go back over it then with that file sort of  
the all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh  
is she also our accountant  
i did that pretty much over here so that you could use it like this  
mm-hmm  
sixteen  
yeah  
yeah  
not  
yeah  
i <unk> i guess it is  
three  
so you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved  
let me just confirm that  
uh brian have you have you finished  
with the with the curved edge  
okay case material supplements  
because one solution for this um uh uh <unk> changing channels is to see a summary of all channels  
and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to <unk> to complete this process  
okay let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh  
right  
yeah it'll be alright  
yeah yeah  
right  
yeah but  
this button can also be the menu button we use in the menus well we we can add another button here but  
you don't use anything else  
positive  
which make it uh  
well the problem was even when we just were creating from the excel file  
yeah  
okay  
have fun  
mm  
so i think yeah it's i think it's <unk> one of the it's a good way to um  
yeah yeah  
a little bit i think but not not everything <unk>  
yeah yeah  
considering the little amount of input we had going in  
mm  
and uh and if if we can keep them you know rolling then uh you know  
and let her adapt it also to the segment basis  
right newer speech okay  
so the he's basically based on this theorem so so what he's saying is like if you do this error  
and uh also uh uh well that uh depends a little on on on you  
is it unlocked  
better to ta  
that's that's two track  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
ah  
and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it <unk> helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project  
yeah  
uh we don't have any particular time in mind when we need a <unk> that works on this stuff  
mm  
the third one  
i think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh you know  
<unk> there's the frame problem  
yeah sure  
one  
there is that possibility yes  
okay so we give that a six yeah  
a. level like examining board which seemed a bit ridiculous  
yeah  
'kay  
the the letter d.  
the final formula ready i could uh <unk> apply to the new stuff  
because of the twelve and a half pence cost  
uh <unk> um no  
yes  
okay  
yeah i was thinking if if you have your hand it this is your th  
uh so yeah  
but they don't  
i mean i suppose this sells because it's very very extended  
i'll effectively sort of go through all the segments and check if they're clicked on  
well he's just not gonna try to le squat there that's all  
that's not practical  
it's the r.  
and the younger market could use kind of the <unk> voice control method and the older market might might <unk> exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not  
yeah from age of sixteen so yeah  
hmm  
i think we got some exclusivity in that you know we got something that nobody else has right now  
my one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with we only had four wasn't enough  
mm  
so if if you want if you want to be able to say i'm looking at a square instead of i'm looking at the construct  
that stefan use  
yeah yeah yeah  
but it depends whether we take a decision to use it  
let's move on to the project evaluation  
but if you if you  
this wa  
mm-hmm  
thirteen uh twenty twenty six point five uh seven thirty two thirty six  
yeah  
yeah  
and then integrated <unk> yeah but that would make it not so easy to use  
detect where the mouse is and change the default tool tip for that component  
yeah  
well <unk> yeah  
mm-hmm  
and hubble  
in details  
<unk> you are not <unk> outlier  
um  
<unk> probably  
uh there's audio functions  
<unk> because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh <unk> or or radio waves although  
yeah you can let them to do that  
yeah but do you like to have a such a <unk> stop button  
i it's yellow  
and what about the number of buttons buttons uh  
i don't know because it's somebody else's programme and then they're gonna give us the next version and that's gonna break our entire pipeline  
and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use  
no problem  
that the excel thing is pretty cool  
i think safety <unk>  
or grey  
and um the contrast uh of it it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
but to me it's like okay you have got your here's our ideas okay  
yeah  
um like it can be in plastic rubber wood or titanium right  
i i don't know  
it's a rare <unk> or rare opportunity that you can you know you can try one head to head against the other  
yeah yeah i think that's definitely a good idea  
i personally don't have too many friends who would be too keen on getting it anyway  
since you're handy as well why don't you do yours next steph  
so we'll send one but weren't men i mean we could mention the fact that we're inviting other people  
so that's something good um  
we're not gonna make it  
but it's uh related  
uh  
yeah  
one point eight yeah  
mm-hmm  
there's two kind of balls the smaller the the the so you can <unk> you can <unk> you can control the scale  
meet the technical requirements  
this is not a a gesture of mistrust  
really isn't that representative  
so i liked that i had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing  
ah okay just press the button please uh  
people do not like that  
yeah  
i think we might actually i think that's probably be somewhere like well or something like it  
we're advanced chip are we  
mm yes  
i don't think so  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah me  
yeah  
you turn on the two copies whenever at different times  
okay  
uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the t. v. set  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
what do you mean integration  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah but what if you lose your click on device  
then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more  
all the mo yeah are between one and two  
so this are the they have to work together  
yeah  
so i don't know  
twenty five  
um  
wow  
wood  
right  
okay  
okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours  
yeah so post evaluation so we can put in some idea of what the evaluation is like  
uh i just quickly jotted them down  
okay  
i'll give it a two  
the problem is that you have to transmit many of them  
part of the corporate identity i don't know  
but this is but we haven't looked at data like this with this with our old fashioned analyses um you know  
you might might want to do  
and uh i i think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply  
we first start with the overall uh  
yeah well  
uh don't get many mo remote controls with  
so the the form will have been uh tested out so  
hmm  
mm  
we tel  
the person looks a <unk> a part and they've got a uh fixation before and after and there's blink in the middle  
okay  
um we have our colours not are not fixed but this is the general shape  
both are s. d. k.  
which i think is fair enough and so this is gonna be one big thing here  
oh have you considered the option of using a solar panel  
'kay so here's our agenda our agenda  
no it's  
yeah  
uh this fruit and bright colours yeah well i think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour  
let's go with a simple chip  
um so uh so it's effectively a track for each i. d.  
so i so the <unk> the actually the reason why we got together is that it's ab it's about the time to a. make sure that when petr leaves us uh i'm afraid it may happen  
for marketing  
um i think it segments quite well though first one  
yeah  
well an eye attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be  
yeah  
yeah  
a one  
<unk> bowl or something  
or give it a colour  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
uh yes  
yeah five minutes of <unk> <unk> for programming  
yes  
yeah  
hmm  
um  
so um  
yeah i think that's what we should do  
that's that's pretty much all you need i think  
alright  
i suppose i've got quite big hands  
these numbers um  
yeah <unk> what  
have you not seen napoleon dynamite  
mm  
we have the zap and uh the volume  
great  
but it would be better it's quite easy to send <unk> from an email address  
but it won't be uh an acoustic separation  
oops  
well let's close this one  
that'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times  
okay  
it's a a bit personal  
i dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things  
but for the moment just for the purpose well <unk> for the moment it's just to understand each other so we know we know that the uh  
and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year  
so now it has to <unk> the financial <unk>  
it is true that you always sit around you know you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something there's five different remotes  
morse  
l. c. d. is  
yeah that that was very good and uh now with david  
okay for now it's a six or a seven uh <unk> six maybe because  
simplicity  
oh  
huh  
wait for it wait for it  
or blue or  
on i. m. two i. p. one  
let's let's save it  
okay thanks  
right  
it's  
oh yeah  
smaller  
alright  
any more points to discuss  
yeah  
you are trying to make make up make us up  
so  
well maybe we don't have to <unk> define the target group by the demographic of age maybe we can define it by like the demographic of  
that would be an alternative if we can't actually load the whole thing and  
yeah it's varied  
well it's it's single single curved  
the curve that's really needed is up here  
go i we're glad they'll look after that bit  
uh  
because how do you do to <unk> select  
if you use yeah that becomes really  
yep that's right  
and th then there is a <unk> synthesis i think it is the <unk> synthesis from the some like something like cat <unk> voice and <unk> this is so so  
yeah that's right  
okay  
which i think's a really cool idea that would sell me on it a little  
uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium the front is the the upper part and the the bit with the with the l. c. d. screen  
okay alright  
yes i think we have to take in general every time there's been line where's there been line  
okay  
soon as i  
you know text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen but we do definitely think that it's a viable option  
again i'll give seven  
the speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost  
i don't think spectrum should be there  
so  
and double curve on both sides  
yeah  
you have to set the channels  
from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy  
coloured  
so as you said fruity is in well sells good  
i suspect that it will  
but i think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques uh voice recognition that these kinds of things  
yeah  
either of them  
because then you need uh  
that filter mm yeah filter out  
you know without sound recognition  
yeah  
yeah okay okay  
so that's not a good idea  
yeah  
i mean you said earlier on i it should be funky  
yeah  
but the <unk> yeah  
so yeah we'd probably want to merge ones that were very close into one  
let's hope  
exactly i've never seen it in a store  
i would like to see how it looks like  
um always display the primary buttons clear and visible  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
fifteen  
is there like a scale that we have to hit  
or you can always go to google and type in banana remote control  
it would be useful to know how everyone's gonna store their things though  
yeah i guess  
yeah  
i think if we remove the the l. c. display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control  
um once again i'm uh gonna take minutes  
um  
a phone whoa that would wow that would hurt  
so <unk> yeah  
it's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately  
oh yeah  
but now button supplements  
components  
um so in in the meeting se series so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series are sort of  
a giraffe  
i've uh made a presentation  
that means you don't wanna meet right  
six  
i was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells so  
it's a very bloody cat  
the l. c. d. yeah uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah  
but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then it'll work  
what we're gonna do when we uh  
you'd have an l. c. d. versus just a a normal clock  
oh  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
just popped up  
lottery numbers and sport scores  
um  
oh i added like five slides too but i  
that that's that's a good point  
and there were so many buttons it took me i don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button  
oh yeah  
well yes well uh re reconsider it  
uh something like x. fig uh can output the vertex points um for creating the air the actual <unk> in the first place  
'cause you're gonna be completely unavailable when you're recording  
um  
both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control  
oh there are issues oh there are issues  
mm-hmm  
so  
mm  
mm-hmm  
well you can move maggie and bruno  
uh the remote control looks fancy  
most people yeah  
it's exactly the same  
uh-huh  
oh yeah  
like a banana  
or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh <unk> don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for  
what now  
well do you want to do your presentation and  
because you are the the marketing uh expert  
and uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours  
mm  
um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines so they won't be uh very expensive  
um the case we have a few options plastic rubber or wood  
you then filter it to say right between time x. and time y. they're they're constructing that having triangle one to the construct  
that way it it falls into your hand  
yeah  
is twenty five euros a mid market price for a remote  
working with the components  
so it's interesting when you have tens hundreds thousands of meetings which is not the case  
so this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing  
okay so that's the difference  
this is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface  
so that uh th  
okay  
wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana  
or  
both  
yeah  
is this something that's known outside ellen's head  
you always have a print plate  
so it's fairly easy  
you can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our c. d. <unk> and things we like about the city you know i think we'll  
a rabbit  
ye i think they're a separate class yes  
yeah  
so i'll th i'll i'll try to address both things  
right  
and we have <unk>  
hmm  
final prototype yeah ye yeah  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
um we also can choose what materials um the we could use metal we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti r. s. i.  
yeah and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television so  
and you might wanna talk to alex to find out if somebody's already done this turn redwoods stuff into tree bank stuff so that they can compare  
but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion  
and um maybe yeah a <unk> a banana is uh is <unk> not easy for a remote control but <unk> yeah  
no  
that's yeah  
no no insurance can take care of uh means anything can be insured in this world nowadays  
uh  
not doing  
yeah mm  
mm  
okay so should we say two for that  
you're three lines in  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
that means that we have to gonna draw it again  
um well i uh okay  
i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes  
and you  
did anyone  
how <unk> how do you know this angle is th is the correct one  
yes  
which brings me to the different energy sources  
okay  
what else do we have  
right  
yeah or mel mel scale so it's uh it's being uh more wider for higher frequencies and of course the <unk> the spaces right  
yeah i think so too  
remote control should only be used for the t. v.  
no no  
voila  
we only use ten per cent of our brains  
right  
okay  
ah well this is like this is almost nothing  
u. s. b. <unk> definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there  
uh  
um yeah if you got right  
anyway  
okay so um we did some research we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls  
we  
pumpkin  
yeah that's <unk>  
that's one  
okay  
hmm  
ah  
well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design  
fine  
we have to think about those aspects sorry  
yes and you're right there as well  
so um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control uh it's very easy to change uh the channel  
one 'kay  
but not a real sponge  
but users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like  
mm-hmm  
also the <unk> for something else which we decided against  
okay we'll move the  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
'kay  
transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the <unk> sends the signal to the l. e. d. which translates the signal into infrared light  
oh yeah  
oh wait that's false  
even this complex  
so are we gonna change anything to this  
did you just break the pen  
well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um  
i mean there are quite a few people who are abroad and who won't bother to turn up or can't make it or whatever  
i mean it's not that important easy to use but  
mm-hmm  
the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself um made out of rubber and  
no on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link  
yes  
yeah  
but yeah it can get lost  
they're all weaker than they're all stronger than the dollar  
we should have <unk> uh special <unk> button on the t. v. to make the remote control beeping  
that there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though  
well it's terrific eh  
and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh  
of the project folder  
yeah  
yeah  
i don't think one exists  
here we go  
ca  
sorry  
maybe or  
yeah well uh  
uh l. c. d. screen  
we can mention it but it's not gonna be too essential and uh we might actually just end up making them worry that  
guillermo is taking very good  
who want who would like to go first  
yeah that's  
television things or i. p.  
because of the voices wouldn't be comparable then  
in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype  
oh  
um yeah  
f. eight  
for example if you enlarge a button or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen uh the co <unk> aren't always the same  
for people up to the age of thirty five you're kinda saying yeah they want it  
i'm just quite surprised it all actually worked because i've been working it we've been working on like incomplete versions that haven't worked for a long time  
i agree it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just  
no just like in a  
yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know nokia model x. and then ten people make face plates for it  
are we going to <unk> i say we individually rate what do you say  
the remote control should only be used for television  
and well so this is you know a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this <unk> this scroll wheel for the television  
alright  
um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick  
and at the end um sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing  
switch colours  
um  
<unk> <unk> you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example  
right okay  
okay so is everyone happy with that  
that's really bad  
uh well  
so okay  
huh  
a good leader you know a good leader is somewhere in the shade and  
yeah you're right  
uh-huh  
but you'd have to phone over to find out if they have it in stock down there  
we've considered experimenting with running this through a spell check  
yeah but the infrared it's uh well a little bit old fashioned if you would call it like that  
okay  
if it creates something more complex or more expensive then i don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity  
let's go  
so he was uh i was just telling melissa this do you want us to stop  
no <unk>  
um now you can all give your presentations  
yeah  
okay  
well i think uh especially because of the microphone and the l. c. d. screen also  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
yeah  
these kind of things are a bit yeah  
well maybe <unk> then we have to do something with sponge bob then  
<unk> a property  
oh okay  
okay i'm  
to have a you <unk> you speak about with <unk> voice control  
i  
well you can easy add a command line parameter  
but uh maybe make it two because the games are in a sub menu and not uh it's not an entire game  
i i i think it's <unk>  
so we should manage some kind of decent space  
i <unk> i don't need all my p. files just three of them  
um yeah  
so ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system  
well as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still mm 'kay  
yeah yeah  
well but because you say they their features are important they want <unk> um a lot but not  
so that's uh the benefit uh variable approach  
ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium  
it is a region of the spectrum and they're actually using a region of the spectrum  
okay so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching  
oh you press a press a button to talk and the the t. v. the t. v. sound turns off  
so the minimum  
well yeah we have power button whether that's present  
so the first one is really standard so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it right  
but we won't make it because uh for solidity reason of the table  
and yeah we could take out the curve  
we have the original balance sheet or yeah  
sounds good  
or another way is maybe people who have t. v. sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something  
mm-hmm  
then we don't have to sort of extract that data from the individual utterances  
even you <unk> you have the controller i can i can say channel three so it's <unk> come to channel three i don't have to  
that's natural  
mm-hmm  
but i'm afraid this is the real world  
mm  
i mean you know not to make any errors like in because everybody knows how to do that  
so  
well  
oh well let's go ahead and back previous  
and i think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes  
yeah  
exactly  
huh  
exactly  
why is uh-huh  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
yeah  
we should we should go to other for the other topics  
yeah  
um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the l. c. d. screen and you use this as a jog dial  
yeah but people don't read manuals  
um you tend to take the closest actual word that would fit the context  
it's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up  
oh  
<unk> yeah  
um  
um the various functions used for changing channel uh channel up and down volume things like that  
um i'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now  
um yeah  
hmm  
now you've done one and not the other  
so it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner and um into one basically  
yeah  
it's <unk> a possible new product  
uh it should be designed for a use <unk> uh group below forty  
and  
yes  
i mean just because we cannot rec uh we can <unk> something we cannot do with uh it seems for with the high <unk> quality uh capture uh device is to have a stream  
okay  
but i'm <unk> i don't agree  
and uh  
so could you put the more information back in then  
yeah  
i'm just closing it now  
um intuitive  
you know i i <unk> i have several four remotes  
and the r. and r. logo it just says r. and r. now but uh  
so i might make this a two instead of a one i guess  
okay  
um it's also possible to use this one as well  
oh was that  
so  
so  
yeah  
wa yeah  
or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it yeah yeah okay  
the items we had to drop  
<unk>  
<unk>  
everybody can use it so that's easy to use  
mm-hmm  
yeah integrate it  
no  
perfect  
mm-hmm  
three like a keys separately but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top  
thank you very much  
so  
easy to use  
ah okay  
right i think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that it's just the first step  
yeah sure  
the user interface design  
so uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons  
because when they're blinking basically it's like an a nil code  
then you could probably afford this  
i know i really did the the whole mango idea was great  
um yeah i think i it might even exceed it um  
excellent  
mm  
<unk> no  
where is it dumped  
fruity  
<unk> think we we have a well i <unk> i suppose it well one th one thing you do is uh re is record the <unk> speech signal separately for each for each person  
and then we also have security feature for example this here <unk> it's very robust it doesn't break and the material what's the material again  
but th th on this remote th these controls are for something else a d. v. d. player or something  
yeah  
anyway  
it'd make more sense for us to divide up spend a couple of hours dividing up tasks and then do them separately  
that  
i should have made mine a white rabbit  
so it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy  
can i  
uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date  
it's <unk> yes more or less  
which is something you do all the time when you're watching t. v. and the button to switch it off in case you get bored  
yeah we get the  
do we have an online calculator  
so i mean it's a kind of feature that in my opinion can be easy to detect it and um that can  
yeah but we have to comment stuff out for that i think  
and then i'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion  
so i think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort  
pardon  
need an advanced chip for the l. c. d.  
number  
but um hold on till i find it i think this shift button might be stuck again  
r. dash c.  
uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time  
next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are <unk> are like the theme for cloths shoes and furniture  
yeah grandmothers yeah  
i mean uh uh i've made yeah uh i've made several notes just to test it  
<unk> okay  
we do not have the time <unk> uh now to to redesign the product  
um so we're designing a new remote control and um oh i have to record who's here actually  
yeah two one one seven we have  
just save it  
yeah  
yeah  
how how  
yeah  
oh  
yeah but but that's not our market  
okay it's a friendly panther  
yeah but that but that's the fun part of it  
all of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons  
i do  
<unk> <unk>  
and it's a simple format i suppose like uh like you have scenes and shots and uh key <unk> some time stamps  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay some of them are here  
um hopefully not  
yeah exactly  
but not the kinetic  
<unk>  
uh then for electronics um so i didn't put anything for the  
well you know for marketing <unk> marketing for me is uh and uh how do i go here  
oh  
i am the industrial design yeah  
i  
okay  
it might not be very clear  
uh i think the best option is to use uh the basic battery  
i mean if you grab it  
'kay uh pens are over here  
<unk>  
good work everyone  
yeah but are their  
do you reckon this stands for lambda or yeah okay  
it wouldn't be as heavy or bulky and  
um but put a warning that if it's logic then there's a good chance that no one will understand or not that many  
yeah  
used option  
overall score  
yeah  
um the other suggestion and i i have a feeling that  
sends signals to the the television  
mm  
it's <unk>  
probably this is all too complicated worrying about that at that moment anyway  
okay  
well  
energy chip on print  
we're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two but it can be either of those  
cheers  
yeah  
um  
and also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display  
and what what is the acceptable criteria  
yellow looks like a banana it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room  
and although it's true that the group i agree decided to to had to have a lounge  
come on  
just orally  
so you can fit into your palm okay  
yeah  
one two three four five six  
yeah  
'kay  
yes i mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh  
but that's uh <unk> <unk> department  
yeah alright yeah  
well  
mm okay  
um we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well  
interface we're doing push buttons  
okay fashionable  
well we need sound we we need real sound recording right  
okay  
actually it's not useful to have teletext  
mm  
mm  
um i <unk> <unk> you know so if they're things that you just know are crazy and you're not gonna want then we don't do it  
okay  
but the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow that's real great uh great concept  
but yeah if we can get the tool tip we should use it though  
mm  
doing that  
so this is our working design presentation  
yeah you could <unk> it leaves more space for creativity  
um mm  
well we've both marked it  
okay  
<unk> and martin  
yeah  
yeah  
is it per remote  
so and and that already this part here already is <unk> created  
i i don't think either  
power  
yes  
since we already have the technology in house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up  
<unk> which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
and i if we go to uh  
i couldn't do any research myself or i see that's yeah <unk> i could have done a little extra work probably then  
yeah  
no no no can you go back one  
yeah ma make it a special colour then  
great  
um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote  
so then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered  
just on the on the screen over there  
maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones straight and uh flat and long  
mm-hmm  
yes  
huh even if in the worst case we can even could you give me the pen back  
eleven  
of the standard edition  
but it sounds like you don't think there's anything that actually needs fixed at the moment  
we could even yeah we could even have a look at our different measures if they um  
well the people producing television sets maybe they have to buy remote controls  
is he aware that th it's his own <unk> tail he's chasing  
yeah  
okay  
um did we come in under budget  
we were uh for example in the um corpus of m. l. m. e. so the one is on the demo  
you have we have to build the things  
uh  
the user <unk> i think  
and then  
exactly exactly  
uh it doesn't have <unk> linux  
<unk> what sort of coding do you get so far for the no no no no <unk> <unk> yeah  
yeah  
yeah i know  
i'm ha  
onto participant four  
so we have i think we have <unk> still we have  
um  
or a fruit like that  
um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity  
i didn't use it at all  
um  
yeah  
but um  
because of the slogan remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users  
okay so the percentage is i i is a cut it's not something you're using for measurement  
two so it's  
um  
but i you can see how it could've been i don't know  
yeah  
um  
but maybe the buttons all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for <unk> people  
and also uh you know traps now  
oh  
but voice recognition itself i'm not very sure about  
yeah  
we need to have high resolution image  
mm-hmm  
well i think that uh speaks for <unk> for itself  
technique  
i don't wanna put a deadline  
it takes stand off links and stuff and it's um some some people if they're not used to linguistic annotation <unk> um uh it <unk> take a little time to get their head around the way the do data data model works  
an international remote control as we want to sell it in the entire world and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty <unk>  
ah well i don't guess it <unk> has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour so yeah too expensive  
we introduced ourselves discussed the possibility of a macro facility <unk> interacting the t. v. a bit more um mentioning of bar code  
this hasn't been done in a while i think but th as a as a watch  
we have one left and one right and that disables what was it again  
that's just it  
let's do that  
okay  
well make the point yeah  
yes  
who is that then  
right  
yeah okay  
no  
yeah  
so <unk> uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh i've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design  
it's not simply a matter of frequency  
so so i mean you wouldn't necessarily consider that to change the turns  
uh but re we really have to cut this off  
well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most  
we have to do what  
it's fine everybody knows what we're talking about  
but they just sort of say a number and where they start and where they finish  
and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that  
i'm just drawing something uh  
hubble deep field again  
it's <unk>  
but that's the end of our meeting  
mm  
yeah you got a dozen of 'em  
so we can't include infrared galaxies  
<unk> that's coming  
that is true  
yeah right  
rubber buttons and case  
you're already three people  
<unk> uh  
oh  
yeah it's fine  
mm-hmm  
uh yeah  
um  
did we decide on the rubber case  
mm  
we want people for <unk> for next week  
i will try to show it to everyone that would be more comfortable  
<unk> what did we say about acronyms where  
well the the the it <unk> depends on the depends on what you build in  
you know <unk> the low level chips inside and you know the l. c. d. button and the i  
that's right  
yeah  
did they jointly look at you know you need some way of uh uh going over the whole thing  
but we need that for the l. c. d. display  
it's okay  
yeah  
okay  
uh they were but they were less than ten percent or so  
and button supplements  
uh-huh  
um no i mean that was going on <unk> uh <unk> sort of um marketing research i guess  
so we could definitely have done better if we've had more resources but  
that should still be viable  
right  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm exactly  
okay  
okay  
that's right  
okay <unk> on for his promotion  
um and steph was gonna look at <unk> ergonomics  
okay go on  
uh fifty percent  
well  
um <unk> i'd you don't want to <unk> um be <unk> and and type what you think they <unk> said  
oh no i think it's possible  
hmm  
yeah i've got a basic search working now  
okay  
fresh exciting  
huh  
mm-hmm  
bring it on  
mm-hmm  
is it started as a pear but then it started looking more and more like a martian when i put the  
yeah  
so is this a good looking remote  
mm-hmm  
okay so that's me again  
it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out  
but  
so we want an energy source  
um we want something that people want in their home  
what i'm we're trying to figure out is whether we've thrown time away  
it's  
mm-hmm  
um if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer  
because we use spec uh <unk> uh special materials the last item  
yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh  
yeah yeah yeah  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
oh what did you oh sorry go ahead  
so i go one layer up  
next year's uh i was gonna say animals or elephants or <unk> whatever  
uh it's more functional  
i think  
okay  
you have must be innovative technology for remote controls but more in how you control stuff not in how you find your yeah  
uh okay  
um so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control and any idea  
um yeah  
<unk> like that  
considered the re yeah  
but then the print on it will <unk> um change it  
yeah  
yeah  
well not what to do  
um the second important thing is um the it must be uh <unk> technological uh <unk> <unk>  
okay  
but we do we do have to decide a priority thing so that's something else we can look at um a little bit  
um we can have your bog standard double double a. batteries in a replaceable um little compartment  
and then the tandem training <unk> also so the you are able to train the net now  
maybe se well maybe also something where something ends like for mine and some string that we pass to describe what like what it is  
yeah i think so yeah  
it <unk> it was about uh i  
and the other approach was was this h. m. m. based stuff which is which is basically just a <unk> of the you know  
yeah but you don't have to  
i would say i mean it's it's not at all right  
mm  
mm  
yeah  
that would that would serve that purpose  
it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm 'kay um so i'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group aim it at them  
and some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that  
and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana  
um  
uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about you know like brightness and contrast  
so yeah i think you can do it  
i mean like at the moment it's not too bad apart from i think the sound is stuttering and that's <unk> i think because of the laptop  
so let's see the what  
if i have to do it <unk> like flexibly then i probably then it will not be significantly more difficult  
it's like the the lyman alpha forest sort of  
but you're guessing in a way though aren't you  
'cause we really don't have anything else there do we  
alright  
yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood  
th uh this one is and this one the video card  
that will be the volume control i think which which a user <unk> it it should be already <unk> defined  
um so okay  
no  
breaking oh right  
yeah  
okay that's great thanks  
i just love you tech guys huh  
so  
um what i did just now is i downloaded  
yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels  
almost  
but ooh the the main point is to to uh like make it faster the the the decoding or what  
uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah kinetic uh  
line <unk> and i think that should be in  
optional or <unk> with it  
mm  
uh <unk> we had we don't have an uh  
well we are not very <unk> we do not know uh much about the the <unk> the financial part  
i like it  
uh what will that incorporate  
mm-hmm  
it's not on my screen  
which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small not too big  
<unk>  
even though there are all the other same topics where it doesn't occur  
so that's <unk> <unk> that's one option  
oh  
know what i mean  
okay  
two  
i'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium and basically it can have a flat surface a curved surface or a double curved surface  
but but apparently other than that they're just as good  
so maybe  
i think this is pretty  
it doesn't really write normally  
yeah yeah  
with uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions  
and uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild  
that's yeah derived  
they usually have the little light uh source i dunno what the heck they're called the but yeah the little cells that  
is recorded  
ha  
we wanted to make as close to trap as is possible which is silly but that <unk> you have to start somewhere  
it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah  
a two a two  
but i had one person who said circuit  
well  
but what <unk> what <unk> said you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves  
uh the new black i believe  
yeah  
right that's what i meant  
i think it does  
uh <unk>  
uh-huh ooh okay we really gotta wrap up so yeah  
yeah  
nice  
one with l. c. d. one without l. c. d.  
not too big  
so we have to take care of this fact also  
alright  
mm  
yeah that you don't need a battery  
yeah  
so you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the p. c. b. and uh on pressing this button i a circuit completes  
be because for now uh i'm just sampling the sound that uh eight thousand  
i  
so we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it  
maybe a kind of three  
so i'll use this  
is it some just some ordered pattern  
okay there you go  
so i thought that was pretty cool  
there are people coming in here one after another  
where i've saved it  
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the  
paint it  
well make it available in different colours you mean  
mm-hmm  
can be made as fast as printing paper  
um i don't think i'll need that really 'cause i'll just dump out a temporary file  
you can't say i like to do it and but then ah but i will do it when i can  
maybe they are using the same frequency  
the l. c. d.  
i mean something that you the transcriber here yeah yeah  
um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all  
uh um  
or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share  
okay  
i i wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control so  
yeah  
we just make a small charger and put it  
but there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh  
then i can generate <unk> <unk>  
the it's a convention  
um  
and i can either on this side or this side um  
it has to be uh yeah you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house  
it's uh looks uh nice  
yeah  
twelve bucks  
sure  
well you <unk> you should to adjust the thing  
yeah  
al almost  
mm mm  
it could be on the right side for example  
yeah  
yeah  
no i've just um split them up uh somehow um by um there are several documents for  
so now i'd like to ask for your preferences  
that there was a lot of room for it  
no well uh once he gets the frame like from here to here then where he advances to to start with <unk> computation of the next frame  
it'll be again in the marketing  
it was com  
and the other is uh more user friendly little with big buttons  
i sort of have been promising this for a week now i <unk>  
uh well that's <unk> band <unk> yeah  
two  
for o. g. i. numbers  
that's one thing for sure  
is it  
it did not very many pages only like two thousand or something like that  
yeah but those are more fancy functions not not really many features or something  
remote control is hard to lose  
oh okay  
so uh there is a difference between if they even though they're still looking at the same part  
um  
so um <unk> first and then two ti you know half as important as that is technology technology and half important as technology is easy to use  
just half a day you have a remote  
do you reckon a two  
yeah  
came a long way but not we didn't not uh  
my <unk> is all out  
you want it to be on both screens or just just yours  
um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push  
absolutely and it's kept us within budget  
okay cool  
yeah  
right  
hello  
well  
then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces  
okay  
great job  
yeah  
right  
yes because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it  
we have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do  
oh right my roles um so um in the different um stages of the design  
okay yeah  
mm-hmm  
that's it's custom <unk> and  
well uh okay  
and the second thing is and if the material they really do not want it to be very hard  
um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes  
do you have a lot of new information  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh that's what i've <unk> i'll have to try and find out  
and moreover i think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the l. c. d. <unk>  
yeah red and yellow  
uh  
well i think we're qui quite done  
that's better  
yeah that'd be really good  
yeah  
okay  
um and when you see uh the audience  
yeah  
because i have here  
is  
i don't like play doh no  
and first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the t. v.  
<unk> <unk>  
the tool training is to try out the white board so  
and you know you have the  
i think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that  
and also integrating the remember to integrate the logo and the <unk> slogan  
oh no radio loud and radio quiet are  
yeah  
um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button  
yeah maybe  
yeah i think  
some children like to buy banana shape some apple shape some even pineapple shape some orange shape  
where is it  
it's yeah  
um uh the <unk> ergonomic design well mm i mean i <unk> uh i dunno i mean the the repetitive stress things  
a shark  
yeah  
then we don't have to talk about it any longer  
but uh i have packets for about um uh alpha second  
i'm the i'm the <unk> so  
and if there's no more t. r. one track the t. r. one track is gone now  
yeah  
hmm  
okay  
huh  
so so the only thing is that i can recover it back from berkeley  
<unk> of the four things  
wooden cases  
this looks more like it  
no  
yeah  
uh i don't i dunno uh that's one possibility  
okay  
yeah  
nice stuff  
um  
okay american um  
yeah i think we're all using the first one  
all true  
if po if we're gonna do it  
so we can celebrate now  
so you think that if for example if they're looking at um one or another um apex of a triangle it would just that would make a difference  
yeah  
yeah neither neither do i but i've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this actually so  
that's too expensive isn't it  
yep  
your l. c. d. screen is going to go  
um  
if you're doing emission from high yeah  
so i  
that's yeah no prob  
no a remote can  
i think we're rubber is not expensive  
shall i give a short introduction and then uh  
my document is the wrong one huh  
so  
or  
but even nist you can  
i guess we have to  
one on <unk> this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb  
you guys sort it out  
as a watch  
you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product something that's quick and simple  
ow  
we will stay here and uh and break off  
yeah  
yeah  
how do you draw a dog  
yeah  
no but it's really handy actually if you see  
th let's say in g. s. m. or something else  
yeah  
okay  
um so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled  
probably both  
so the only thing that yeah so the only thing that would happen basically if i double click let's say from the whole meeting series on a single meeting  
mm  
i'm a i i'm  
hmm  
the spongy feel or did we think that that might go as a trend  
uh  
it it it  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no no i i se okay sorry  
a <unk> mm  
and then it would have a <unk> uh wider thing to uh have the light  
we can do it here then  
there can be also solar cell  
so um <unk> you mentioned  
uh me too  
mm  
here he is  
uh so it's probably easier just to <unk> shove 'em in  
oh i hope <unk> not to much relies on missing stuff 'cause people blink  
you know you know what i mean  
yeah  
yeah it it's a beamer but then with a within a mirror yeah  
mm-hmm  
you know because you wanted to <unk> you wanted to have the topic segmentation  
mm  
i guess we have to define what what we're aiming for  
or the or the no button  
and and and its <unk> and its value  
so it's the categories across each other i think  
so i mean we'll hopefully be able <unk>  
it's a <unk>  
yeah i think it pretty much everything's covered  
chat off line for a minute a about a list of things that i think you really need to take a look at  
we have rubber special colour  
like when there is light they'll work off the light and if there isn't  
mm-hmm  
'cause then we can just publish a script that you just run and then this whole thing starts  
do the the math  
the uh conceptual design uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production  
yes i guess it's lunch time  
so you just have like the number buttons power button t. v. video button  
um  
so it it just signals the the different uh <unk> uh the different symbols on the screen you have  
as well as having the logo on and all that  
so th yeah you you you were saying that you would like to evaluate that now  
well there are very few uh schemes for marking up exchanges on actual data right because um people haven't considered it very important  
thank you very much  
yeah  
hmm  
i like the idea but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double  
right  
mm-hmm  
okay  
basically yeah  
yep but we're going for the simple buttons  
yeah  
i think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case which we will decide on rubber  
looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something  
so  
you would have to hire a number of people and it might be more expensive  
and speak to it  
it was wasn't it  
i i am too  
uh we want an on off button it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important  
yeah  
so what what you're what you're gonna do the analysis on  
and i'd never heard of the kinetic energy before so  
yeah  
exactly  
right  
and we can try to say well we want to do it but uh basically <unk> and olivier were the person mm-hmm  
new pens  
okay alright  
i'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal  
but uh th the important buttons <unk> make them always accessible and <unk> and clear and maybe use a touch screen  
i think we'd like to think the ideas were new but we've got no way of finding out  
okay who wants to go next  
sorry i have them  
may maybe that could be the backup  
yeah yeah yeah  
between the the <unk> the first new controls and  
but you want to have the information because the the mouth you move it  
and then it all comes compact  
so not how much <unk> not how often it's used but  
okay  
we'll give the buttons special colour  
um i think the main impact is complexity um and the other thing is um the power options  
yeah at least even ten k. bit  
mm  
okay  
okay  
and how  
hmm  
but i think like a <unk> a proportional one is probably not bad idea  
no  
now uh  
uh-huh  
<unk> okay oh alright  
it's about forty eight hundred i think  
so mm so for dialogue yeah mm there would be uh some kind of uh interaction structure  
yeah  
yeah  
um so a as far as i know this is just missing an e. cetera  
if you rule out functions then uh and that gets known then people are not gonna buy it  
go to it  
uh  
well net would run on anything  
yeah  
right so it's th the frequency still to be changing  
so  
but it's also not completely um  
i dunno if you know the no nokia telephone with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms <unk> something like that  
so and the marketing expert will  
because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first but  
so there are already people but again like uh at the end like for l. v. c. s. r. people are using p. l. p. <unk> or m. f. c. c. <unk> or nothing of these fancy feature  
like almost once an hour  
mm  
gosh  
yes  
so um i'm very much open to suggestions of where we go  
okay  
which more  
we were we were thinking that  
okay  
that could work  
yeah  
okay  
well the question the question is what what is <unk> gonna help  
you can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function  
yeah  
well one thing i'm aware of is  
what <unk> uh what i was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on t. v. and how they are numbered on the remote control  
okay but like let's just be careful that whatever we sort of we merge together  
yeah  
i dunno  
yeah  
yeah  
to think about  
i think we've cut just about the same  
i've come across that as well  
maybe you can detect breathing  
so i mean  
<unk> is from uh a. t. and t. no  
what about that  
yeah you would think  
what have you got on for the rest of the week besides getting this stuff up and running again  
well yeah the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today um you should keep it <unk> at this  
yeah  
up they come up with their modules they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here  
no way  
um otherwise becomes to complex we wanna get this out um very quickly  
marketing expert yes  
i mean it i i thought the way that tim had this set up originally  
mm  
<unk> but  
okay  
yeah  
um and so there are three different stages to the design  
um do we have any functions that um we'd want on it  
they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells  
mm various covers  
okay but so we can discuss that uh  
hmm  
kangaroo  
mm-hmm  
so it has an it's easier  
yeah those results only you reported in <unk> no like uh thirty nine p. l. p. results  
before we wrap up just to make sure we're all on the same page here um  
so what you want to do is be able to define um bigger periods which is the period when they're sort of interested in triangle one overall right  
you guys all right handed  
uh required  
yeah  
yeah  
they were like round curves uh different uh  
researcher at least if not a professor rather than two students  
uh basically <unk> yeah we we designed the two uh items  
but it's not going to have more functionality 'cause it's only a low market it's a cheap end remote control  
i mean it's only pressing buttons you don't have to do anything you know extraordinary  
depends how how easy you can write in it  
mm-hmm  
mm  
okay  
so easy functions  
so are things we are we have uh speak about before  
yep  
no sixteen  
i'm sold  
i don't think you need it  
that's gonna cost ten ten euro seventy cents a unit to make  
oh  
however um there are some changes that i've got from on high that um  
mm-hmm  
alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys  
mm-hmm  
and i'm the user interface designer for the project  
so uh  
um well i think i can sit for that since it's almost my final slide  
mm  
yeah we can do the the get frame  
oh in case you want it  
yeah we've got like five minutes left  
mm-hmm  
so the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel  
yeah  
there was this notion of forward looking and backward looking  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah <unk> <unk> and they can download it for you  
it's just how to a  
we could group them uh on one button  
uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups  
the actual remote <unk> the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus  
but and i think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something  
and from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the <unk> or mm  
yeah the thing itself  
okay  
you're comparing them  
yeah  
and easy to use  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible  
hmm  
i mean that's where i'm having gigabytes and gigabytes of stuff at the moment  
okay  
yeah  
so welcome back  
i think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume  
so that means we could have thirty talks  
okay  
if they wanted  
yeah  
i think it's better to have all the software  
but well if you aim at the younger market um a as they as uh <unk> uh as we seen in the <unk> uh lab  
no i think it's uh the lounge uh the <unk> room  
behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen  
mm  
um the base station is also off the shelf all the materials and the  
i would like to uh give you an idea of uh how i thought about  
but we'll just create like hard segments at the start and end of each meeting  
yeah  
and the video button  
even some panel discussions on that human speech recognition reducing gap between the a. s. r. and and h. s. r.  
so so uh zero to nine or something  
cheers  
yeah  
i'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders  
uh  
uh  
whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that  
um  
april may we should have results  
yeah  
mm object tracking  
yeah that's  
well that's when you go to uni isn't it  
let me just scoot on ahead here  
i think we could go for the kinetic energy source  
now how for instance would the university feel about a room that would be only used as a lounge  
yeah  
well would it be more trendy  
yeah i've done that for the correlation as well  
yeah but the feature itself is blue wing flux or if it was said blue wing feature we'd mark feature  
yeah  
the double whopper please  
i think it will yeah  
and and just put the pen in into it and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly  
like a covering  
yeah i think this year a lot uh <unk> there was one paper  
and there is an extension for this this uh this device connected to it uh with uh optic fibre  
mm-hmm  
mm sure  
okay  
is it easy  
yeah  
and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product  
yeah and that was the main issue right  
it could even be one of our selling points  
i don't know  
now when you were um creating your um prototypes here did you work together or did you like do separate projects  
yeah  
the remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons  
it it depends on the whole ergonomics of it you know it's like how you put your hands so <unk> it's the least movement basically  
yep okay  
mm  
well just kinetic then  
what  
and then finally  
yeah  
oh right  
and i know she is saying and then somebody <unk> saying something to her and she goes comment and then you know you know that so yeah  
yeah  
it's not not high  
i'd be tempted to  
yeah i i know what you mean  
yeah  
other  
right yeah thanks guys that's very very good work  
but <unk>  
but to write it th yeah  
what are the other slide yeah  
but but yeah sure  
okay  
is there a need for the remote control to to talk back  
comes to your whistle  
i change the question  
'kay here is the agenda for today's meeting  
channel setting menu  
it's not up yet  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah of course  
and that's and that's it  
now i would have hoped i think that's my only slide actually yeah  
i think he made that  
but i think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting especially if we're going after a younger market  
um  
i would make it two  
and uh if we co we compare to last year now it has to be spongy yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah well i i suppose that i suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this  
he was also playing with all these compression factors and lengths of the of of that  
um  
mm  
the second is is economic uh we need to find a balance between features and price  
right  
do you want me to sum <unk> i think it's not  
well i don yeah it is kind of  
mm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh  
i'm i'm wondering whether still we could ask for to get an intern for this  
oh sorry i i thought it was a problem of like uh one having underlined the entire oh sorry  
yeah  
um what about the case  
the problem is we have a limit in a month of time so we cannot do something very new  
yeah i tried to copy that one but it didn't work  
uh-huh  
we can't uh take a blank one  
alright  
yeah  
got new ideas from each other  
yeah yeah  
that's clear  
so it should uh  
i think you pay half per remote  
hmm  
i assume  
hmm  
uh you can see there's a <unk> a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior  
try out the <unk> every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal  
um what have i found  
nope  
one battery  
to navigate yeah  
yeah  
sound card  
um  
uh so i th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um  
well i thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing but  
maybe i mean if i get <unk> more numbers i'll <unk> mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages  
mm  
okay thanks  
so now it's time for lunch  
oh  
but i think in a sense in my opinion well there are two things  
so we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that  
so they still get all the data and just they internally say oh no this is less than three and i'm not gonna display it or something  
or not really other things but the slide is no longer uh a support for the discussion huh  
mm the <unk> yeah  
let's move on  
um  
yeah  
okay  
so uh well i think <unk> when we are working on the international market  
yeah but it still has some yeah  
yeah  
we we're not lacking in ideas you know it's that was not the problem  
this is a question that should be asked to the  
so so they <unk> they will be happy with their own features and their own scripts so their bit rate like tend to change features every time and it's  
that's right that's right  
thank you  
uh as as i say when you when you are not here that that petr <unk> knows enough about it too  
mm  
<unk> three or four i'm not sure  
mm-hmm  
uh in the train uh hello uh no  
and always this should be this should motivate you  
poster session is a good idea because just the people presenting the posters are there and can say something about it  
no no sure  
well yeah it certainly has some  
or maybe even a step further when you want to um  
we will uh i will take notes during this meeting so  
uh you can't have a <unk> there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast  
yeah  
great  
yeah  
we have five minutes left  
in or out  
yeah the the the there's a signal at the start and the end of every trial  
a t. yeah uh okay  
no no no no  
okay  
yeah  
this uh yeah this is of the bus where you can send you can send some package  
excellent  
you know  
yeah fair enough  
oh okay  
again  
and also for people who are a bit <unk>  
like really just fin finding these kind of strings  
and um  
yeah  
the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros  
um a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material  
it may be a bad idea  
the basic requirement  
mm-hmm  
okay you know very artistic  
to make it a little bit easier  
my remote control's black  
well but how how often do you watch all these channels  
okay um right okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
yeah  
so your slides are ready  
uh so  
and we should target the inter an international market  
mm-hmm  
mm 'kay you ready  
and then if the battery limit is indicated  
and volume here  
how do you feel about that  
mm-hmm  
but sides uh the sides should be okay  
yeah  
trick  
yeah  
no no  
not certain anyway  
definitely  
oh i'm guessing that's what it is  
oh he just wants to know how to get paid  
so they'll not <unk> not shy away from something quite high tech  
it it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and  
yeah  
green  
yeah  
but in your case it could be interesting yeah  
yeah because a microphone is very small thing but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote  
maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that so  
you you'll see  
well we'd wanna make sure we're pretty happy that it's reliable because  
they're they're thin <unk> with copper wires etched on to them and di i think they're quite easily printed on by machine  
okay  
oh well that's it then  
yeah  
yeah  
come on  
mm-hmm  
i will try to <unk> it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards  
yeah that that is ancient data though  
oh no ethics that's gonna cost us money  
okay michael  
less  
so <unk> what you're mentioning is a pain for us  
so  
working design  
yeah  
it looks like  
no  
yeah uh open your thing again  
so i think we want to be aware of not making things overly <unk>  
okay  
i mean i think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows  
yeah that does make sense yeah  
i'll try and draw my favourite animal  
so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that  
yeah  
tiny  
and i think that's what it's referring to even though it's not  
yeah but has to be clear that you can use the arrows  
not some thing you you throw away next week you know  
so you know now the basic the basic things  
there was like yeah mm-hmm  
okay  
so provided that you get your words in the right order  
we will also try to uh  
mm  
hmm  
because it's only got what these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back  
well not everybody has uh has uh a p. c. at home  
yeah  
i think  
yeah  
three  
hmm  
so it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that  
<unk> oh okay  
yeah  
squared  
people put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that and we can start using some of their ideas  
could maybe do with some more colour  
high power user cell i  
okay  
uh i think you can  
we also have the white board  
and here are the individual actions for the for the other roles  
because i mean you could just get carried away with the with the <unk>  
yes so mm  
yes  
not much more than that  
right okay  
okay so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria  
like make an index search and stuff  
finish the meeting now  
to have a help button  
just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier  
um  
i don't i think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology  
so this is something else we might wanna consider is really kind of limiting the number of buttons  
and interchangeable case  
um we've evaluated  
yeah  
yeah  
um i like dogs because um they're so good to humans  
so again you may end up some  
yeah  
that's uh you know never needs replacing  
i've uh  
that's it exactly yeah  
well yeah  
yeah  
mm  
um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market i know we're working on television remote  
yeah  
oh everybody needs <unk> questionnaire  
excellent  
yeah but we which makes it kind of really big yeah  
we done good and we're finished in time  
okay uh what i'm not understanding here  
um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience  
'cause i think you and i had separate different views on this but i can't remember <unk> who had which view at this point  
it doesn't matter conceptually what that data is  
i don't think oh  
um uh  
that wasn't me  
uh in one time i dunno that's not really my department  
if it is enough line  
so um i i'll i'll see if if she'd be willing to  
mm-hmm yes  
hmm  
let's not diss our remote  
uh  
great  
changes like that  
no  
okay so five to ten i i think it's it's feasible  
yeah  
okay so the costs under twelve point five euro  
yeah  
mm 'kay  
i think you're right again  
so they'll be they they'll want to see essentially the gaze settling on particular incidents on particular places  
so double curved is like this this this or  
oh definitely different yeah  
yeah is it is user interface  
in each  
ah okay  
well i didn't use uh  
so uh we have this  
that's <unk> rubber buttons yeah  
okay so kinda spongy material  
anything else to say  
'kay what's my favourite animal  
if everyone could do that as well that'd be great  
that's probably fairly simple to do actually if we do it in that most primitive way of just saying as long as you display more than one meeting  
yeah i haven't gotten like sort of my confirmation that <unk> wednesday is fine  
yeah if you're happy to do that yeah  
yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it  
and i th they like to sleep that's why you said you they are like this  
and it makes uh it gives it a more <unk> user friendly shape than if you have uh  
it's it it's no well it's it'll recognize uh i guess keywords but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase  
if we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to  
um i don't know if you saw my presentation during my turn  
and you will see that uh if it's long enough it's some significant event  
okay  
yeah that was a single video structuring but it's uh other level uh it can uh it's quite uh it's researched yeah  
so  
innovation  
yes and and styles  
okay so i don't need that  
okay  
they they won't hear the the beep  
yep there it is  
'cause then you like i don't even know what i'm turning on  
okay it has been saving something but where to i don't know  
let's call that our measure of alignment  
um so that's what i got for agreement  
right so that'll be it  
i mean that's quite trivial to change and we got a lot of other work to do  
hmm  
mm  
well i <unk> i think that's that's ugly but  
but uh to be more precise about uh to to check maybe the this yeah exactly yeah yeah  
i mean the scroll <unk> pretty cool but  
yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat  
okay  
uh we no no but yeah  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
is a call i don't think i can give the highs ups  
<unk>  
uh yeah that well we did think of that  
data and then video name  
yeah  
or in what i <unk> when that happens what i do is i put laughter in front  
yes yes  
'kay  
yeah  
mister participant two that is  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
what about the just developed uh sample sensor  
yeah that's fine that's fine  
uh-huh  
maybe because the the screen is on top you can have  
it's um i think it's just the dictionary in the first place  
mm  
uh  
who is she you're talking about  
<unk> did i miss something  
yes  
i think it's more your problem  
we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t. v. and if you close it it will  
okay that's all i have to say  
um  
i think it's adjourned  
i think maybe th the packaging it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
oh no no you need you need to generate these images right  
um  
eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good  
oh  
no just uh ask if if he could manage  
uh see i'm uh i'm strangely attracted to it because i know that's it's definitely gonna be big  
great  
and um you're gonna was it your idea to stick the bit in it where you say um uh  
yeah  
you could put a game on it  
so okay we have one three a one that that have to got up  
you  
broad line emission and the rest frame u. v. should all be one  
that's what we're using isn't it  
and whichever one had two pieces put together first is the earlier numbered of those constructs right  
uh  
so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes  
yes  
and so i've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion  
we might as well  
yep  
okay with the titanium case let me just check that um titanium case can't be curved it has to be square  
yeah  
yeah agree agree  
there's a <unk> judgment is that that  
oh okay  
i was th uh <unk> thinking to myself i have this little remote control  
yeah i believe  
yeah  
but of course they are li it's not original at all  
great okay  
oh but it ha it has to be <unk> yeah  
well the trouble with doing it on the word level is if you want the audio to synch up  
oh right that fits doesn't it  
mm-hmm  
and they do like sector by sector block by block they try to recover  
but a in there's no i don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years  
um it didn't have any self intersections so that might be a problem  
okay  
and so in conclusion  
personally i want to be involve in that project  
well it's reported i i won't say  
okay  
that's not sure but it's  
actually does <unk> does special material mean that plastic is not a special material  
but obviously they're like a few hundred pounds  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas  
according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation um following buttons are most important  
right okay  
yeah yeah go for that first  
yeah yeah i see what you mean yep  
too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your <unk> yeah  
i guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood <unk> a rubbery type material that throughout yeah  
<unk> no no <unk>  
so  
mm it's enough  
emission feature  
yeah i think so  
but uh it's it's also for children or just uh  
yeah  
yeah  
right  
i had a i had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh real reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing  
well 'cause sometimes they go you know like that and then you're not really sure whether it's three times or four yeah  
so could you put them in the same format as the other data  
and then in the next meeting we decide  
it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem  
yeah <unk> but when you say technologically it's more uh i dunno in the core or single  
that's right  
yep  
do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the  
is it very complex or is it <unk> oh just multiplying together  
because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah  
but  
me too i felt a bit blind throughout the project because in the beginning i had no list of available materials  
um i did took the minutes from the first meeting and i'll show them to you in a moment  
mm-hmm  
if th  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
ah okay  
yeah okay  
but okay  
oh these are strawberries  
yes it it has a mm  
a fancy look and feel okay and not it specified not a functional look or or feel uh <unk> <unk> <unk> fancy  
oh  
oh but not it's not very spongy because it's hard rubber  
no  
we  
okay well <unk> let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
but it would be nice to have some basic system which just displays some stuff  
twenty five euro for a remote control  
okay  
uh and also the real time and play time stuff would change  
but then again that costs as well  
mm  
uh-huh  
do don't speak so it's in here in that <unk> do we have any we have special form don't we  
yeah yeah  
that's almost a crotch mi <unk>  
three presentations  
programme it  
yeah  
yeah okay but don't touch don't destroy your prototype  
yeah  
yeah  
and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use so i think i'm not sure about the l. c. d.  
yeah  
yeah  
um we will see in which order we will handle them of  
yeah  
thirdly they say that <unk> half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls  
um remote controls are bad for r. s. i.  
okay  
uh i think that wouldn't be a good idea  
so that's not too bad  
i think one in <unk> bright colours would be good  
yeah  
yeah  
so if you use titanium  
fruit name or something like that  
we need  
back and forward  
just remove them completely  
okay thank you  
um it it should be cheap you know if if we avoid any you know electrical connections  
huh  
do we want it to last longer or rather have people  
yes  
it was a management decision so it's it's pretty much out of our hands at this point  
mm-hmm  
but um presumably what you <unk> hope is happens here is what happened with um transactions  
mm-hmm  
mm mm  
we have forty minutes for this meeting  
yeah  
alright let's go back to this  
okay  
an artist  
and if and if we introduced it when they're this age they're going to probably always buy a remote that has  
uh which is not  
no sorry  
so <unk>  
which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices  
so bad i don't like it  
um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp  
usual sort of stuff you get everywhere  
if yeah  
okay  
yeah  
right so that's finances and i dunno what we what could we reckon we could add  
click don't yeah  
well that's the thing i got i in the email i got this <unk> file but this slide was just there mm-hmm  
well you can read it it's not too difficult  
blinks are a tag uh from the e. d. f. and and that sort of thing  
although i remember discussing this like um 'cause uh when neville was working on his his stuff which was just based on the slides  
yeah i would just end up with uh values for each word so i wouldn't have um  
that's  
you use the  
yeah  
it <unk> smells good for children  
um new preferences preferences  
that's that's a kind of testing of our hypotheses  
you can come back  
lemme go to the web page  
so we will wrap up  
yeah  
okay  
and i'll i'll give you the uh i guess technical considerations for those  
how big are the chunks you're looking at  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well i uh uh put these things on  
hmm  
uh basically there are too many buttons  
i think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped i i mean i that really opened my eyes  
um  
oh  
mm mm  
it's here  
did i miss something  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no  
we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well we don't have many um  
you mean something like uh <unk> uh that <unk> coding system where you're or <unk> <unk> <unk> what is no what is exactly <unk> system  
okay  
control and it answers is i'm here  
huh  
put an extra the button on  
and you know maybe even having <unk> on other things  
and we got these large  
i'll do  
and i am too in common with maria  
mm  
two different person will speak  
it's leaning  
ah i see i see what you're talking about now  
yes  
that's the <unk> yep  
mm-hmm  
uh they will buy a nice looking um  
what you can't see is volume selection it's a little bit higher than all the others  
okay  
um not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example  
but now we use one scroll button and the other one is here  
thank you  
right  
or a or a ball yeah not a a wheel but a ball and you say uh to  
yeah that's a that's a big  
mm  
yeah  
two point four two basically  
do you see any constraints from any administrative sides  
so wait did it let you go on the internet or was that just what it let you see  
mm-hmm  
so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting  
and i used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design  
so i  
so  
i don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you <unk> because one of the menus that we could have available um <unk> via via the l. c. d. is one where you scroll through channels  
so see you in thirty minutes  
okay so let's try it let's <unk>  
i mean if it's if it's just like  
well i don't really have a favourite animal but um uh i think i have one in mind so uh  
<unk> within the sentence that you sort of currently looking at um feel free to correct it that way that you'll do you know like it's not only about resolution but it's sort of like coming up with a corrected version based on these  
yeah  
so but for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens i i think we using a a smaller screen is better because  
if you if if <unk> it's a foreign word and you know what it is just enclose it in <unk>  
but it's gotta fit inside this this sort of this sort of format  
nerd  
cheers  
so that would show you how much relative to how he sort of how he's performing generally in that meeting relative to that how he's in a specific segment  
we don't want  
one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control  
i'm happy to say m. two what not absorption is a <unk> feature  
if we don't need it  
uh-huh  
four or three  
the means the <unk> didn't work  
no don't worry about it  
yes  
right  
um they want to pay for an l. c. d. screen and speech recognition  
yeah i think it's pretty important  
that's alright that always irritates me anyway yeah  
and those can also be used for the menu  
yes  
it could be an ape  
and um yeah that was the result  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yep  
yeah in the dis display on the t. v. screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the <unk>  
of fruits  
yeah  
if  
whereas this is two curves  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
it does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass produced  
possibly it might be worth the investment  
okay  
i mean it's worth giving it a go and then men maybe seeing <unk> what information you can add to the data stream to improve performance  
crucial delay  
no  
great  
putting everything together  
the <unk> the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet  
uh  
yeah  
right  
yes um uh but in fact you have to sit in front of the microphone and it's uh yeah  
these three  
<unk> titanium  
no  
true  
at first i thought it was a dead leaf  
you got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out  
yes  
mm  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
'cause we di we had a <unk> think about it  
um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions  
so it's it's skipping stuff  
based on my research  
a bee  
really  
um  
mm  
mm  
so we have to uh for  
looking through some of the sites uh i looked for the sites that the models differed on  
yeah  
okay of course it will become way more ugly  
you should taste it  
right okay uh so i need to  
we are  
mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what i see  
we are at uh two seven eight ten fifteen point five  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
okay well  
yeah  
yeah  
and i made a mistake  
more or less broke into the speech of the first person and so on  
but it's one handed um  
so yeah how would it work  
at least to some of us  
i think you  
so it's just a voice to to okay  
um yeah i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced  
yeah that's a very good idea yeah  
flat on the top  
yeah  
but you can make a yeah you can make a trigger here  
okay  
yeah you cross 'em out  
i'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting  
is it okay if i try  
if you want it to be something you know it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it <unk> make it  
yes yes mo  
doesn't sound  
twelve fifty uh  
still not there  
yep  
four o'clock or  
well not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right left up down  
i mean one of the things running through my mind right now i <unk> we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made  
well no we included <unk> steep soft component sorry  
yeah  
the real reactor  
okay  
alright  
uh yeah  
um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces like for d. v. d. <unk> movies whatever  
i don't think it's very interesting  
yeah  
uh  
what can i say  
we we i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour but  
anyway mm let's recover it  
okay cool  
it would  
this is the on off button  
mm-hmm  
to get the uh  
well  
you know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that i can't hear  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i if this is to <unk> to to to make a change in the colour light and uh they have a lot of uh shots  
that's the end of the talk the end of the presentation  
oh i uh since this is only okay  
so uh is that a problem  
yeah yeah yeah i mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that indeed yeah  
additional button  
so they would all be in the same time scale  
yeah yeah  
but the problem is like all this i think it may not be there in database i guess  
let's do that  
yeah  
no i guess i don't know much about the remote control industry how much your average sells for but i know i am aren't i  
um and then we went over a couple of different ideas  
okay so we have three three two two or  
so it will make more sense and if you get just extract words  
i i think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting  
yep  
or they say movie name or i don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel  
okay  
so if the data manager filters it out and like i just think that in in the logic of the programme it's it's much easier to justify why we say we treat a series of meetings as one single thing rather than <unk>  
yeah  
even though it is for just a t. v. remote it's uh very advanced  
uh  
so what else  
so you can draw uh see it over th on the screen  
there we go  
uh part one and part two  
that's uh three uh or le less than a three  
so it's a kinder way  
dolphin  
are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented  
okay in the water  
some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running <unk>  
mm  
hello flores  
that's good point  
on your coffee table it's not like an eye sore that kind of thing  
some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe  
okay  
you have  
mm and why  
because we need  
okay  
uh and easy to use  
you won't be able to find it  
mm  
twenty five  
okay  
uh i think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the  
okay so  
uh we did yeah  
i don't i don't know  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
okay um so we have it within cost anyway  
it's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of  
task  
which is based on uh doing decoding uh using uh likelihood as the scores  
mm-hmm  
okay but in the oh yeah the colour  
mm  
yeah  
cool  
this  
mi u. s. mi missus the missus  
okay  
um i think a cover is necessary 'cause <unk> otherwise you'll just have the l. c. d. screen  
uh-huh  
well  
that will be okay  
oh we're all so proud of the  
okay yeah we swap uh okay  
like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes  
yeah  
and also the cost for the speech recognition  
but the retrieval or the  
so  
yeah  
and you know what teletext is  
what is this now  
is it in  
and i think it's uh it's reasonable  
i'll give two or three  
i <unk> i don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept  
no signal  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
so  
okay  
well good luck  
okay  
maybe  
even i found like uh very few people in some oral presentations  
um  
yeah  
i in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it  
i'm not sure what teletext is but i'm assuming you guys do so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design  
yeah it's it's the same solution i think  
i mean we have access to it here and i guess it probably means that we we can't give it to anybody else  
sure so we might find that when we move from what we thought was open domain but on the hub  
well we'll have this on the screen on the display  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
you'll see  
mm  
yes  
okay  
you know kind of more ergonomic that kind of suits the palm of your hand that kind of thing  
yeah  
uh i think the display has some method for it  
black's probably the normal colour you'd say yeah  
hmm  
mm  
oh okay yeah  
there's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment  
you seem to have information on that i'd like to uh  
mm-hmm  
uh i'm doubting doubting as well  
yeah  
huh  
mm-hmm  
and it should be someone with experience in c. plus plus m. f. c.  
mm  
well my issue with that is if it got too big though 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle  
on your  
yeah sure  
hmm  
and young people we think are a little bit more flexible they think ah i'll buy for a couple of euros some <unk> nice hip uh  
yeah that's true  
yeah  
yeah  
so uh maybe you can go to paris and milan uh once again  
curvy  
uh  
yeah for  
any new ideas  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
or  
so this just show how we're kind of <unk> the whole thing  
hmm  
topics yeah  
and these latex cases there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source  
hmm okay  
it has to be used something special and you really it has to  
energy  
yeah  
down left and right and we think we could make that quite a good feature  
so it's got nice big buttons it's got a very limited number of buttons  
all we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs  
okay so we we stick to battery one  
so um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well  
mm-hmm  
and they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side  
the cameras did  
yeah even automatic on off is also a bit problematic  
maybe you and i should be the pilot subjects  
so after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype  
right  
i think it's alright  
yeah  
because the same button is doing too many things  
i isn't it smaller the minimum no  
yeah and don't know how it's or eject it  
mm-hmm  
yeah it was after it was after that that uh there was the thing about um <unk> <unk> why the <unk> was the was a mirror image  
uh furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use  
so  
yeah almost  
mm  
you <unk> you get electrocuted or  
yeah  
to the border basically some distance  
especially when it's made of soft rubber like this  
so uh i'm the project manager so i had to fill it in and uh hmm  
yeah true  
i'm pretty sure that you got that anyway  
this is to take the just take a new slide and back again  
so they just have to use it yeah  
um basically in terms of making decisions  
so we began uh working out a concept  
yep  
bit low responsive though  
mm try it just try it  
that do not include mm  
yeah it only says that this <unk> percentage like l. c. d. screen  
not not too heavy  
right  
um i'm uh i'm sorry  
that will be the our first uh real prototype  
so you so you so okay  
but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new  
the we expect a production cost of maximum  
'kay  
yeah that's right  
mm-hmm  
uh  
maybe it's boring  
mm yep  
like batteries or do all remotes require batteries  
but uh i think we can keep it all under budget  
yeah  
so that you <unk> basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone  
yes  
and then it didn't have like any kind of table like awesome i'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result  
yeah  
remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t. v. <unk>  
and and also the volume is very important  
and we have to keep in mind the the reliability of our research  
a mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition  
are <unk>  
you um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences  
okay  
yeah some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front  
speech recognition  
of course it should have a on off button  
uh both of them so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from you know  
i think i might agree with you  
and then come here and you have no idea what the others have to make  
we have to look into the costs of those  
yeah i'll do the first thing i'll do is make a load box for selecting a file  
yeah yeah  
you see  
hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget  
and i judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that's what we were going after  
exactly so  
mm we were doing descriptions that made things separate classes in which case i'd argue for elliptical i think  
i like the hand dynamo part  
and we can just <unk> based on that  
no  
yeah that that is fair  
uh this is always the case  
he went about code m. l.  
first point is seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly  
well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah  
the u. s. b. for which  
yeah but we have to see what the si what the size is  
yeah  
sometimes i think  
for example it loads all the utterances and so on but it doesn't load um the discourse acts and for example not the and what's what else there  
'cause the dialogue uh the display also gets the information about like the relative and the absolute times  
yeah that's a nice title  
um i don't know  
you were comparing what with what  
and uh remote control are really bad for r. s. i. problems for twenty six percent of the users  
so three  
voice  
on the or  
only if we  
no flipping  
uh-huh  
so depending on what we want our functionality to be um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap  
yeah  
alright  
we'll come back if we can to the rubber being added at the moment that's where we are  
given that we're not putting line width itself  
um i just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities  
it's eating  
the next yeah  
okay we'll we'll just okay  
as a research report you put here submit it for the conference  
should yeah just wait for a moment adjusting  
okay so maybe we should build a <unk> store a mean measure for the segments and meetings as well  
type type it  
yeah i can do that  
yeah  
or black and yellow  
yeah  
okay  
here like basically it's like inspiration basically i'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and  
so um you know it's just a matter of working out space  
um  
okay  
because um in fact as we are targeting uh t. v. in fact we can use t. v. screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have  
save as  
uh  
so possibly like a uh sorry just to butt in for a second  
also they like curved round shapes  
and so you can fit that you think  
but i think so  
okay so that's well that's <unk>  
mm  
banana  
uh-huh  
yeah for the future  
yeah  
yeah  
two and a half  
yep  
now <unk> we have to decide  
only seen a couple in zoos  
um everything all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow  
okay  
hmm  
and uh the source is of course the user  
that's but it's it's not  
but if we're gonna stick to it let's stick to it  
and you have to keep it under twelve euros and <unk> fifty so  
what was the one we didn't do before  
okay  
yeah  
oh  
if solar panels with the rubber  
oh you want to <unk> split that one and do you into two  
it has wings  
yeah  
right  
what i what you are going to do for your thesis  
back  
so  
mm-hmm  
no  
mm  
so what are your favourite characteristics  
it's one  
that's zero  
yeah i agree uh we can take it from there  
yeah okay  
okay  
yeah  
yep  
sorry boss  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
so yeah  
mm  
as or as hearing is concerned we can have some gap at some place so that  
so uh you two will be together <unk> working on a <unk> on two prototypes  
yeah <unk> th apparently  
um nicer materials and might be  
oh and we want a curved case yeah  
we actually use the television okay  
to make it more trendy  
ninety percent of the time ninety nine percent of the time people will be using the main functions the volume the different channels  
mm-hmm  
mm  
and and we would also have a <unk> little um thing saying here previous and ne <unk> <unk> next  
and keep the <unk> volume selection and channel selection very easily  
two  
really  
you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu <unk> if they want to record <unk> or whatever you know i mean we can sort that out  
if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case so we have to take that into consideration  
i've forgotten  
so what are we going to do with this project evaluation  
we treat those as as other objects  
five or a six  
um channel one two  
yeah alright  
yeah i th i think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um  
no menus  
yeah which is the next big thing so that's not gonna hurt us either  
i got a whole table and everything  
okay if you both think so  
i was also trying the warping  
unless it's a three dimensional web which <unk> they have sometimes  
so  
yeah  
um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that  
there  
ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose loosen up a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah  
but they have uh eight microphone that are uh at uh yes the eight um the eight uh uh <unk> corner of uh a cube yes  
i don't think it it's any uh value added thing  
not that your opinion isn't valued but but still  
yeah okay  
yeah then you have a problem  
so uh i don't know who wishes to go first  
there are how many sixes  
oh you can arrange  
yep  
yeah  
like i can't think of what  
mm-hmm  
i i you got you got different colours but you should have a standard colour  
sound nice  
yeah  
yeah i think it's okay  
okay  
i think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the t. v.  
well you can just no i'm not sure if we can do that but we could put a microphone in here for example  
so two yeah  
and uh put them in the the project documents uh folder  
yeah  
um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that  
no  
okay  
we <unk> we went through the agenda and well we had some uh some presentations from you three  
yeah the well uh <unk> this what i uh what i heard  
mm-hmm  
yeah and automatically um  
yeah or <unk> or also <unk> for the <unk> yeah  
you can use uh them  
found easily  
<unk> when i go to the second channel what what does it show me  
yes  
yeah  
and the company slogan we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo  
so it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want  
so  
okay  
yeah  
<unk>  
okay  
oh that's good it's good  
i think it does  
<unk> it seems uh so  
for <unk> for aurora we didn't do anything with that  
it was a complete disaster  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
yeah if you have  
yeah  
so the question is at what stage should we put that in  
it's just the way i figure it twelve point five euros per unit we have to sell at least like three million or something like that  
at the end it it depends a bit what you want  
um  
i dunno where she  
yeah  
and whatever you want your current colour your line width just to make the line bigger  
yeah and then escalate i guess  
that that's what it means by kinetic  
uh maybe i'll have something in my uh presentation  
i don't think so  
well i suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got  
so alternatively if we <unk> we can't do the whole thing in one go  
at uh yeah  
we could put our logo there  
but it might at least be the building blocks of allowing you to track that kind of thing and  
it's a process isn't it  
we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea  
so we have to change that a little bit  
yeah sure of course yeah  
mm  
yeah  
so that's the point  
but i really need finance information  
but that should also be a sub then a sub uh menu thing  
mm-hmm  
like you need to have some representation of a word as not not that specific occurrence of that word token but of of of a given word form  
i think the young people are th uh are uh christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah  
to browse more easily the teletext  
yeah  
no you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it  
or you can use the other one or the speech <unk> with the microphone yeah yeah  
okay it's your turn  
mm-hmm  
so very quickly then can we arrange a new time to have a meeting  
yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons it's about  
a prairie dog  
so we can  
mm-hmm  
i give a seven i think  
a smiling fish  
deliver a full um kind of conference uh uh software  
it can be a bit yeah overwhelming  
where  
okay  
but but because it's also in the i based on the the time course of the procedure you'll be able to basically get the scan path of the pattern of events from that as well  
yeah  
then the raw text can be anything  
yeah  
yeah  
so i'll go over those <unk> as an opportunity to use the white board  
uh  
right and these are problems i've had with it  
so you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies and when it encounters one well it shows on your t. v.  
mm the shell  
yes  
keep taking up the backup there  
most the times that are not advanced televisions  
um so um if you say something about marketing right sorted um <unk> is  
wireless remote control  
yeah but you have the remote control so maybe you can keep it <unk> with you  
um it's quite common in like some applications  
okay  
so that i i think i mean if we need to reach a solution now i i wouldn't mind working from your plan and doing some changes  
mm  
okay  
which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's a <unk> uh  
it could be  
this is the user interface and there we have the chip  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> let's imagine this we've made a construct of two parts and we're <unk> i a triangle and a square  
then you don't you don't know uh uh well  
yeah  
now you guys have been a a great team  
but for the beginning it's enough  
yeah but the user user interface is responsible  
it's blue tongue  
yeah those are nice  
the pictures of the remote controls  
yeah yeah  
yeah but you have that in the  
<unk> so we're point three over  
do you still identify it as a part  
okay  
make it make them bigger  
hmm  
wait where  
uh <unk> some overall thoughts about new remote controls  
down  
so marketing you know how maybe uh  
yeah that that <unk>  
that's that's got nothing to do with the spectrum  
well yeah  
yeah  
well i have here a couple of basic functions i could think of  
you want the you want it to be programmed for example <unk> programmed <unk> or you want it to <unk> your favourite channel  
profits bigger than their cost  
i mean at least one month seems to be uh quite enough for this right  
sorry i didn't mean to derail you there  
volume control  
uh it depends on your set up you know  
if it is unwrap you mean  
mm-hmm  
yeah right  
okay  
yeah thirty you can see you <unk> you can't really like even you can't the models itself is like thirty eight times more than that so  
sure yeah  
yeah  
so he's layout and you're function  
they  
oh for the next meeting right  
yeah  
okay  
enough features  
no it's fine with me but then i know what to look for  
'kay  
the last point to the yeah  
more than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition  
but is it <unk> it's not made from a single <unk> thingy and then uh and then uh no  
sure  
yeah  
don't feel like you're in a rush anyway  
we're now in a problem 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven euro yet  
it's it's not quite <unk> it so it's not gonna be quite <unk> 'cause it is it's written in java  
and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well forty  
it probably means this is probably double curved  
the remote there are remote controls like that yeah  
yeah  
okay so  
and  
yeah <unk>  
yeah maybe  
okay  
yeah that's it  
plastic with rubber  
mm  
and repeat that process three times  
there is  
if you start talking about have to avoid or uh yeah talking about the parts or just naming them or anything like that  
well there's a couple of things there  
and i think you you've never seen a <unk> a round remote control so it is  
yeah just for text for text it's uh it's okay  
yeah  
yeah <unk> um yeah it was just doing it quite well  
yeah also the menu  
it's uh the paper by dan ellis and co  
any other questions  
mm  
uh oh  
yeah  
um i'll just do a next one  
so when your dad's sitting there overriding your decision  
as soon as you said that i was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do  
yeah  
they could be  
yeah we've all broken a remote control  
yeah  
missus  
okay  
and just have different like fine <unk> levels sort of  
oh okay  
uh also definitely a user friendly interface um and i think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it  
oh we're closing the meeting  
uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are  
right  
no not fronts  
but concerning the project requirements and what you just said i think we <unk> should focus on the t. v. then  
yeah  
but you give the input  
uh so if you uh yeah so if you uh you receive an email about that  
i it just came into my mind  
i would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh i find the buttons that i need every time i need a button  
stick on it rather than buttons  
'cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called simba  
and so it will be easy just to illustrate your views if you wanna change the format you just either take out <unk> just like the pen  
um no um i was i was i was describing the wrong thing  
yeah  
it's a it's a giraffe  
i think sort of the bottom line and which might well end up what it's gonna be like is that we take the single highest ranked utterance and put that as a <unk> as a title  
yeah  
now and here i have the top of the remote control  
mine  
it would also help keep the the product placement <unk> yeah  
i think too many computers are just distracting  
well i didn't have time for that  
that's not even  
and then uh  
alright  
<unk> the majority of the time that's all that's going on the other functions happen  
okay  
so were we aiming for a certain target on that scale  
oh i've unplugged it  
so these percentages are are what  
alright  
yeah  
right  
and like when i go home i'll spend like the same amount of time and get loads done if you see what i mean  
why uh once again like you said the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there  
yeah okay  
so  
it never kills an animal uh just for the killing so it's very efficient  
si simplicity and fashion  
do do we have to say something about that  
um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two  
however uh to <unk> not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost  
yeah with some some yellow banana  
yeah  
um i guess that's up to us i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it so um you know  
oh yeah  
mm  
do you require different types of p. c. b. <unk> and  
yeah advanced chip  
mm-hmm  
uh then  
but  
yeah i i but i need it for my chunks then  
yep  
uh no  
so all the buttons has to have to be the same colour  
yeah  
yep  
we said not to mark things based solely on  
right  
yeah  
so well i can't imagine the building the building the mold is gonna be that hard  
first of all methodology  
well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can i don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss  
but you could like have videos of people click on the <unk> and <unk> or whatever else mm-hmm  
and probably a shape also  
<unk> oh geez  
i think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause i don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing  
i think damped lyman alpha absorption  
and you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle  
battery  
spongy yeah  
right  
so  
so i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the l. c. d. thing  
oh that'd be lovely  
that's true  
yeah well i didn't think it was <unk> let's see wait  
checking in page  
fabulous yeah  
like the frequencies are different like very uh  
five  
our energy source is gonna be  
the process was good  
well you can you can give them uh <unk> <unk> three or so so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more  
right  
yeah  
which is defined as the probability of being in a specific h. m. m. state at a specific time having the whole observation sequence and the model  
one  
i thought about a a pear for example  
i think that's still looking at the amount of flux coming out of the out of all the f. e. two lines rather than  
anyway the good news is that there are results  
you can see how the doc <unk> the document changes for <unk> stu stuff based on that  
um i would say that they are definitely less relevant  
like at the moment i think this was yeah yeah that's an old old old version  
yeah  
so uh  
control your remote control  
and then you go to format i think and current colour you choose a new colour  
yeah  
hey  
mm  
yeah  
so what's what are your ideas about that  
why this was yeah mo yeah <unk> i don't want to talk too much maybe  
and people can still decide to use the cheaper one  
joe yep  
oh  
yeah  
you can incorporate names into the menu  
yeah  
um these are the options that are available to you  
move to the meeting room  
yes  
do you um so so from from the the marketing expert i think  
i know i know people who have left handed and right handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the <unk> family and they have a mouse  
so it's made bold  
okay  
mm  
yes  
uh i yeah just a simple experience  
no that's okay that's okay  
well i mean you could look at this this spectrum and spot that um th <unk> lyman alpha has been damped  
hey  
oh goodness who would know what that was uh if somebody that didn't know about linguistics were trying to transcribe s. node  
of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive you know hundred and fifty pounds or something  
mm  
i remember when i was doing some image processing there were techniques for compressing and then coding  
um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh uh in your book then don't worry about that  
it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything  
you want to have more functional buttons  
so i was wondering if by any chance there was something like this in speech with the speech  
so sorry that's a bit vague  
mm  
yeah  
then we should fairly easily from now get to a stage where we can like select individual segments and click on them  
but i i think i think if we stick to t. v. based you know maybe t. v. shows or  
well do you wanna maybe just at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a <unk> as a function of this  
yeah  
yeah  
um so move to next <unk> slide  
no colours are clear shape is clear material is clear  
think could be yeah  
yeah  
is it in innovative enough and is it easy enough to use  
go on  
okay yes okay  
it'll be so much easier  
yeah  
and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions  
like i said to concentrate on t. v. remote control a universal remote might be too complex  
yep  
hmm  
um but what we could do is some kind of well i mean  
something a speech recognition  
alright  
one man one vote  
and so what they end up with saying is most critical for them right now might not be the most interesting thing in the longer term  
um  
<unk> um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with or  
i dunno just uh yeah it's basic  
no it's  
okay  
ooh  
i also think so  
yeah  
yeah  
two  
yeah  
touch screen i mean  
but that might be sufficient because i mean it <unk> up to don't know five seconds  
so yeah let's go to lunch  
uh like some very small words like yes they might be two hundred millisecond  
sorry  
yeah  
here we go  
so  
no no he he he i i  
and rubber  
yeah  
'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um  
i think because it's so small it might be an uh i mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that  
yeah  
yeah  
have you do you've seen that there are the other one there the quasar right  
so that might be some final definition for the uh interactivity yeah  
um not not that well uh as far as i know  
so  
the display requires an advanced chip  
i mean calculators for example  
they listen to it  
what  
and the figures are bigger than points  
underneath  
what's the title  
yes  
yeah they're a little too big now  
if you turn up the volume you always see this thingy go up  
like what  
oh no we haven't talked about that yet have we  
alright  
mm  
yes <unk> maybe you can can send an email to me later uh  
hmm  
take your headsets off kick back smoke 'em if you got 'em  
alright  
right yeah  
four  
link uh  
not straining your wrists watching t. v.  
like whatever one two three four five or something  
i  
so  
that would be good yeah  
has it  
so it's not that crucial  
yeah for with pas  
push button  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
you know  
um design a user interface with so <unk> with so many sophisticated functions  
fine  
yeah it was good  
so i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on  
and left to right  
um well they are in a word document which i will open now  
yeah yeah  
um  
it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message  
'cause the loose uh is continuing from one sentence isn't it  
oh that's strange  
some uh <unk> <unk> uh yeah  
so  
there's no chip there  
yeah  
so he's just uh uh he's <unk> the energy coefficient because energy is really affected a lot  
gonna spend the money  
what do you say all <unk> this is okay with you right  
what the  
um the most important aspect is look and feel  
well this is a terrible  
mm  
yep  
and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t. v. maybe the web  
yeah  
oh i it doesn't matter which end you point i guess  
okay  
so this is what i've found here um a lot of this is new to me so we'll just read through together  
mark sub sections of entities <unk> no that's different  
yes  
my parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so you can pick up and use it than i think  
we might  
just round shapes with uh  
no no not always  
now what is the whole day rating for that  
but the we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points as in just to make it <unk> um nicer to look at maybe  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's true  
yeah it is  
right  
you go here just like using a pen  
um uh up here  
so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly  
and i'll show you my findings  
okay  
screen settings brightness and colour  
but if you tell me this that's very interesting because at this point we can use this kind of things  
we're under budget  
well  
yeah  
hmm  
and we should be able to to figure that out  
and if you make it from that super rubber when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand  
so the disk which has crashed that cannot be recovered  
um we want something that's simple  
um giving you every possible function that the that the device has the remote control controls  
and uh  
yeah  
'cause it'd be quite subtle and  
and here  
okay  
and then we have some chip  
hi  
uh the work for each one  
fruit  
could we make a titanium shape  
uh  
okay  
it's good  
okay  
yep  
oh look we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses  
no  
uh-huh  
mm-hmm  
yeah the shape will will have to be <unk>  
then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it  
yeah  
yeah  
what's your name  
right  
yeah that's the music i grew up listening to  
it's for scroll  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
fair enough  
maybe can design two versions  
uh uh also this time there will be uh three presentations  
uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment  
the remote control is innovative  
we're gonna need this kind correct if we do the voice sensor so one of those  
yeah i think so  
we're not we're not you know tying tying our cart to that one horse  
i'm sarah i went to michigan and i'm here doing cultural studies and i'm the marketing manager or something  
i don't think they're <unk>  
v. c. r. presumably into that then there's a play pause stop rewind fast forward record so forth  
or are there uh  
and uh channel settings  
so self timed lighting  
you can work out which <unk> which and basically yeah it's <unk> it's fun  
yeah but then okay but th at that moment it would be better for me to just make it on a per segment basis right way  
let's say these points here  
i can remove maybe <unk> you have five with push buttons so we can just i dunno try to modify some of them to have yeah  
so want something that looks good and is easy to use big priorities  
okay enough of that  
yeah yeah  
and it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device so they can control the television from wherever they are  
oh  
well but does um the duration of <unk> count for anything  
okay  
so that's sort of  
yeah  
and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i've ever seen out in the wild and i though that was pretty cool in scotland  
uh uh yeah i think we can do it all with simple  
well hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve  
and so it's like  
so we can do this one first  
yeah right  
yeah but it's kind of pointless isn't it  
as long as the <unk> uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls yes  
so you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value  
i hope the people will like it but  
yeah alright  
yeah if it's  
mm-hmm  
um you know it was nine out of ten  
i can plug you in  
or you you still have the possibility to use buttons  
yeah <unk> yeah um  
alright  
yeah  
we we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode  
psycho kinetic  
was it one of our options  
mm-hmm  
i'm saying they could have kept differently  
<unk> regardless of what type of functions we want to implement  
sure  
so um  
right  
hmm  
and it it looks quite cheap that colour i think  
easy to use  
well go ahead  
hmm  
and that's a very bad concept  
mm  
but from monday on i can just do twenty four seven for this one until it until it's due  
and the mouse one i thought it was a good idea because people use mo mice <unk> now with the <unk> thing  
no we can't go above that  
yeah  
yeah it's uh it's integrated  
uh yeah yeah  
and it is a different kind of processing  
mm-hmm  
so <unk> are you working uh actively on this anal these analysis things or you just working on the translation  
the yellow there is the um the slogan yeah that we need to incorporate it's very simple  
what i'm like what we have to think about is if we go with this multi level idea  
yeah  
okay  
um we uh we will focus this internationally so the product will be sold um  
feel to it  
that's true 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going  
yeah  
and it's not gonna fall like a rectangle would slip down behind things  
um  
um  
right  
mm  
it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring  
true  
oh no i think i i it <unk> that it needn't require it to be double curved  
not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a sony product or a  
on the international market  
and push button  
so um  
yeah  
okay  
if we need to do triple a. we can but most people usually have double a. <unk> around  
yeah sure  
i so it's it's it's it's  
mm  
well i mean uh i mean you have people that are aware of uh m. f. c.  
for personal preferences i think that to make a baby proof remote control it got to be a titanium  
yeah  
well  
<unk> okay  
mm yeah  
no number is one  
we use the regular chip  
uh not quite but i guess  
mm-hmm  
one  
then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance but with new uh with new colours new yes  
yeah i think that's the better thing to do  
right  
hmm  
okay  
yep  
well i would like to yeah  
i don't think you we should do that  
and you did say it looks like a frequency modulated <unk>  
you know  
no  
that one step behind  
yeah a range of uh yeah a set of three four different aspects  
hmm  
oh yeah i like that i like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen nice  
my name is name  
and uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen but <unk> i don't know in how far that is possible  
oh yeah  
yeah okay  
hmm  
or is it is it going to be  
or or or ding for you know you got it or i don't know what  
that we can <unk> yeah but so so if if <unk> so yeah  
budget  
different yes  
yeah  
so is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas  
so that all sounds <unk> good fun  
'cause an al like an alternative view would be that  
so i think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good  
yeah  
you know something which is like you see a lot in in other areas  
so that great  
yeah if it's trendy original i <unk> <unk> the user needs  
yes yes this is yes definitely a horse  
word  
well um i thought the right thing to do was to review what <unk> <unk> been doing in the area of dialogue structure for work package one over the last period  
the yes the fan  
so could call it settings or something  
right  
but what kind of remote controls did you look at  
excuse me  
i'm nick  
and he basically he he was the first one to <unk> that these these guys are pretty slow to to do these things  
yeah  
i'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes  
where it going  
but the  
mm  
okay  
because i i still think that the most important part of this meeting still has  
well it depends i mean  
yeah so they can sit there and go like  
if we're including it emission  
but yeah uh that should be fairly easy  
uh the cost will be a lot of <unk> uh a lot higher  
yeah  
so be simple  
so <unk> what's our reviewed suggestion  
um the planet with  
well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place and you keep making the same um well moves  
like <unk> how do you expect that certain words  
because it looks if the same word occurs again and stuff  
oh that was a mistake wasn't it  
so the <unk> you have bought this card right  
um i i haven't brought out one specific marketing idea  
i think that's <unk> that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever  
i suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think oh no i forgot to charge my remote today  
yes okay  
yeah  
it has to be twelve and a half  
even though bits of it may come from all over the place or whatever  
it's uh kind of handshaking uh  
looks very nice right  
change channels  
um i think  
oh  
now it's not even guaranteed in the sense that i can ask this  
and then only comes the creating new sophisticated data chunks  
so basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control  
mm-hmm  
uh it has to be some level of subtlety but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh  
yeah the shape is unique and the colour  
actually what i think you should do is take the highest three or four and then just merge them together into one utterance  
i guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations  
i th i th i think  
that's fine  
<unk> ye  
maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like  
ah is that what that is  
but just a small thing what kind of market we are targeting  
mm  
so  
so if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better but  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors  
mm  
very slow  
<unk> of of the value  
um you say that i don't remember by heart but thirty per cent  
basis station  
that's it  
right  
if we go with the <unk> case or the the plastic case um  
almost no  
so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume  
but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others  
yeah in  
that's her job  
hubble deep fields is being marked  
shall i go  
and both mouse symbols are on it right  
so it must be very bright very <unk>  
industrial designer okay sorry  
and that's right okay this model because it's averaging out over all the pages nearby all of the topic distributions become more flat  
uh yeah  
you know how to power it and whatnot  
but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns i don't know if we really want to go with that because it is just a trend  
okay  
mm-hmm  
which i know there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices  
because if  
oh good point  
um yeah  
so it's something that you can use to actually segment meetings into the um the areas that you think are important for this analysis right  
mm-hmm  
that definitely gets to go in  
manual  
yeah  
well that to be honest there won't be a primitive in between stage  
right  
together or uh yeah together  
um  
no  
yea  
mm-hmm  
<unk> oh uh just actually the opposite  
so let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is  
um and the last one is the working design  
thanks  
and the rationale that we have i'll show you the layout in a second was that full professors would get private offices  
ah okay  
yeah  
<unk> sorry  
okay  
i it looks  
uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design so it's a cyclical process  
is this go it kinda <unk> fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then  
possibly  
mm  
okay  
yeah but uh we want so  
next  
keep it keep it calm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
mm  
so that's where that's uh that's uh  
okay  
like your <unk> which like your information seeking dialogues which wasn't dialogue <unk> but it was very constrained in genre  
i think it does  
okay  
okay what  
yes  
if you re use the existing screen we element eliminate the l. c. d.  
it's only a t. v.  
yeah  
okay  
it seems to be fancy innovative and easy to use  
yeah  
one  
so that so we've saved  
yep  
yeah uh  
so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could  
oh that  
is that for over here  
so how do we do that then  
i i don't know  
if you put it like like here  
okay  
it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do  
uh if someone come and yes  
i agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into  
<unk> you you know like for instance take the ipod  
from <unk> you call c. and back  
go for it  
infrared galaxies  
and that's a big ad advantage i think because  
i think so yeah probably mm  
so uh what do you say  
uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics  
i i had thought we were yeah the eye tracker does  
yeah  
okay  
no it's it's <unk> yeah  
mm  
okay  
so <unk> you don't have to care about some zero values here and but more or less it doesn't matter yeah  
uh pro uh project documents  
i feel it's fine we know we don't need uh i think it's okay  
as well  
and ergonomics we said um i don't know i haven't actually been able to do any of this myself  
yeah we can ask steve if um we can get space  
mm-hmm  
that's true  
<unk> no one could ever <unk> move the mouse  
so it's better to keep it for the latest stage  
now what were we doing if  
oh right  
oops  
mm-hmm  
what about what  
i've got a linux box and a windows box  
of mute let's say mute  
um so it's up and down you hold it this way  
seventeen  
u. c. is the central unit  
right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents  
yeah get in there  
okay yeah  
so on the t. v. screen  
oops  
yeah mm  
okay  
<unk> a bit big i think  
so this the <unk> basically the main he questions or here  
we could use the some wheels can be pushed down could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want  
right  
well but by self intersection here i'll draw here if i can find the right end of the pen  
though there's a lot of detail in the paper  
ah it's yeah  
and the colour should be yellow or something  
mm-hmm  
and it's this one  
we are here to talk about functional design  
yeah  
um i've got a three month contract yeah  
yeah yeah  
true  
um is there next meeting in thirty minutes  
yeah you made a point there  
thank you melissa  
was that you  
the modern material we can <unk> select  
hmm  
okay  
well i thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the t. v.  
on a whole  
yeah we can easily plug it  
on the other side we have more and more channels and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want it's  
mm  
mm  
i i don't think that's realistic because i think what you'd actually do is use um the full record of what you have and do a segmentation  
it is more trendy  
<unk> but what i was gonna say was  
that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one time thing  
yeah but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i've lost the remote control  
yeah  
oh yeah it's not connected to the  
<unk> but well yeah i know but you're paying for th for the brand  
yeah  
we decide  
yeah  
i'm the project manager christa pavlov and okay let's begin  
i would huh  
um extra bulb could just be for <unk> um <unk> which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device  
okay  
two minutes of drawing yeah  
so that's a bit  
and if we put an l. c. d. thing on it then the costs will uh be much higher  
it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment  
and you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes one that has the easy ones and one that has  
so in the in  
i was just reading fruit and vegetables  
i mean operationally it's not gonna much difference whether it's hub or not right because  
you ca uh you can go uh before before yes  
uh i want one um and that goes along with being trendy uh uh you know the i want it  
and they were playing us some other other approaches and it it sounded like a human it was great but  
yeah  
are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever  
think we should just make sure that if it takes quite some time that that the clock doesn't start before or that the audio and the clock are in synch sort of  
yeah  
control z.  
so uh it's like a  
to implement um but i think that would be quite useful as well  
um marianne and bruno are at the bottom  
okay so want me to draw my favourite animal  
but it won't make any huge changes like it'll always have the <unk> the ability to read the original ones  
that's right  
yeah  
okay  
and uh and at the <unk> and at the same end of the day  
logo  
and what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different  
it's it's  
huh  
mm-hmm  
exactly  
yeah the remote controls like the one you've shown previously  
uh uh  
it <unk> yeah  
sure sure sure sure  
right so good to know all that stuff thanks guys um  
um now from the user interface your uh package  
mm  
you just need to find the time stamp  
who is the outlier  
and they want to go <unk> for universal one and they take the fanciest they can have  
so four arrows  
yeah we've got all his code implemented  
we have the charger so it's no problem  
so even if it's very stationary by <unk> um by dividing over this whole stuff he is able to find some reasonable boundaries  
um another thing i think we <unk> missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design  
trend watching i believe  
uh-huh  
that's fifty million euros  
uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the l. c. display  
that will be enough for future uh recommendations  
<unk> yeah  
try again  
yep yep  
so it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important  
okay yeah well we have some time  
okay  
well  
with the rubber parts and uh <unk> of the thing and <unk> when you move it around a lot  
alright you get it  
yeah  
as long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote but uh  
but the question is what tool would you use to get that information out of the data  
i dunno the whatever just some theme and then we have different tones lime green lemon  
creaky voice  
and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device  
i think it's always really funny that when you look at people's computers who don't use the computer much  
th yeah  
um  
yeah  
it's a bit small but i don't know why that is  
like you your window i maybe longer so doesn't really matter like how what size window you use or not  
we should get started  
i give it a i give it a five  
i'm just asking you  
yeah  
you know what a mac ipod is  
so um  
you just have a <unk> a few selected buttons and uh a few menus  
i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things  
maybe  
and we discussed that being included  
mm-hmm  
mm  
<unk> well  
um latex  
so the first one is um does the product look and feel fancy  
so i would did not give this uh a one or two  
it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen  
yeah all the other universal remotes  
<unk> i mean you need to kind of keep it um  
uh a two  
uh <unk> one thing interesting is what we came up in the discussion also you about telling that uh detecting such scenarios where there is no relation between the slide and the person talking  
it shouldn't be a big issue  
i think it's for all the basic well looking from the side anyway  
yeah in it  
right so desert island discs  
we don't use the wave form the raw wave form  
yeah  
correct  
uh-huh  
um what else  
uh the the remote control makes use of <unk> technological innovation like l. c. d. screen and speech recognition  
and lastly did we put the fashion in electronics  
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
if you want uh this kind of words become interesting when the corpus is really big uh uh when when you when you consider each meeting as a single item  
<unk>  
yeah  
well how i have to fill it  
it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or i mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our <unk> uh <unk> uh market group  
so i think we could've done with a bit more time  
that's because televisions they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it  
okay  
no  
okay yep right  
oh well maybe it is then  
yeah okay  
um i mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> once everyone's got the first  
right  
yeah button shape might be a good idea to change rather than rather than positioning  
well this is still is is very bad  
oh no i mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them like on the t. v. remote  
uh-huh okay  
to so what i propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven  
aged between forty six and sixty five  
yeah my personal coach i  
good  
um right so any comments  
we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons  
so that helps you  
i wrote things down but i didn't import it into my laptop  
yeah if we can send email from it  
like people don't wanna have to worry about that  
so you're actually promoting <unk>  
i mean it's fifteen minutes on a variety of different topics  
the memory uh  
um i had dinner i wasn't actually at dinner but i <unk> have the eye tracker stuff working 'cause it was just me running <unk> running round the lab  
fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost i don't know  
yeah  
yeah  
and might be easier huh  
is the material attractive  
um i don't know if you're doing that already but uh  
i don't know whether it's handy to have a <unk> a normal on button  
on to the next one  
uh yeah yeah it's really good  
so maybe this classification rule is not the best  
e. r.  
but doesn't seem to be powered because the because the line in <unk> so low  
uh it's it's one one chip but but you have to choose one from it  
yes  
so  
hmm  
limitations  
that's yeah  
yeah we should probably consult with our legal department uh  
that is really good  
uh  
okay  
but  
very good  
um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly which um  
so but but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth  
yeah okay but but if you pick the the idea the left idea  
it  
yeah  
they grab  
you won't lose it  
yeah maybe so  
because you have new  
then <unk> yeah but we don't have that  
we don't have  
yeah but you still couldn't see it  
oh yeah <unk> yeah  
yeah  
yeah sure  
spongy  
we're gonna have the three kay phases as you've probably already been told the functional architectural and the detailed design  
so any things to  
and and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip  
yes  
yes  
well  
mm  
mm  
well just the numbers could be embossed couldn't it  
yeah  
but at least yeah a script are there every scripts like at least scripts are there but so if if they can decode  
uh  
was it working design or components design  
and veronica on channel eight and you want to move veronica to channel five um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
no not even  
it's too beautiful  
computer mouse  
and they slide  
what else  
um  
but the the net result is that i've come up with a first cut for the working design that i'd like to discuss with you  
me too  
uh um  
okay  
um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up and that's the first thing that they see  
ouch  
i dunno i th anyway i think it could be <unk> interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls  
i guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi format like um you know pal  
mm  
and some summaries for for what's going on  
is there a <unk> yeah  
more <unk>  
so we have now a lunch break finally yeah  
so the shapes is something between the square shapes with round <unk> corners and a round shapes  
filters  
but we also have <unk> scroll wheels which can have integrated <unk> or we could go all high tech and have an l. l. c. d. screen  
yeah i think two yeah  
okay can i have the laptop over here or  
so it should work for one but i'm not sure if how exactly it it um calculates everything  
i mean you're supposed to hold it like that but um just if you grab it  
yeah so we keep it singly <unk> single curved then  
so then again compromise uh between the quality and yeah  
yeah  
nope  
mm-hmm  
it's cool  
i'll buy it  
this is quite uh nice  
well is it possible to make it soft  
yeah more more consensus  
especially if we're selling into the u. s. market <unk> there's a lot of spanish speakers there  
i don't know  
no it's not so expensive  
there's a lot of functions  
no it's it would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors  
some of us at least have to work together to get it running probably  
uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes  
so  
so you can power on and off what else can you do  
ah yeah  
okay  
um does it <unk> keep its identity  
yeah  
can i have your cable please  
ah it's a it's a bog standard algorithm  
functional  
i mean the  
yeah the  
okay let's have a look to the agenda today  
mm-hmm  
so there's a different functions but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control t. v. and control your recorder  
i think  
that's  
exactly  
so that is the thing  
three <unk> three for me it's <unk> it's okay  
yeah  
mm  
microphones are on bottom  
um right let us um  
yeah  
okay right right  
are you trying to suggest something  
you want the normal piece of paper  
but i mean with transaction coding on something like this you would use i <unk> you wouldn't consider it verbal analysis exactly  
uh did you have something about uh  
i think so  
is i if i  
we have the colours  
the initial plan  
thank you for the warning  
uh we are not interested so much in sound level but uh in the level of uh the sound that corresponds to voice  
okay  
and that kind of thing so it's i think it was a word starting with d. and the person was going or <unk> you know  
okay can i not put this  
i don't know if it's very special  
is it spongy  
so uh which version of my data was that the very first one  
in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is <unk> it's television only it's it's simple to use  
do you need to do a presentation first  
uh  
but yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want  
mm-hmm  
it's just your turning from the base  
yeah  
at least it's new and maybe technology new technology  
now  
yeah but i but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the <unk> on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control  
so  
mm-hmm  
right  
um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through  
um oh and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting  
so yeah  
um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements  
but we'll see  
so what i wanna do right now is hear from all three of you on your research that you just did  
single  
i guess i'll find out  
<unk> what other th analyses we want <unk> want out of this that aren't settled  
the the <unk> again european standard what this give us they give the m. f. c. c. <unk> and they give the pitch  
yep  
okay  
six  
okay  
yeah i i th  
i think those are two very strong features if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost  
yeah  
<unk> some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten  
so  
so  
unbelievable  
i yeah um it's not necessarily done explicitly but it's equivalent to that yeah  
yes but it has your name on it  
yeah  
yes but when you put that same volt voltages on it  
<unk> i think that's pretty much the form for full hand  
yeah that's clear  
so i guess we should skip that because it's not that important  
'cause it seems like  
what do i write down  
'cause i also don yeah it's depends on the costs and such  
and it's practical  
so you just make the back of this part a bit bigger so that it lays a bit <unk>  
um  
it has taken a little while hasn't it  
yeah  
okay uh what about teamwork  
then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board  
so yeah for uh for for uh exchange of information  
oh what should we decide on then  
no we can't  
no that's true  
yeah  
and i have red hair so uh must be red  
right  
uh uh if when they get moved together  
oh my god  
um you are the  
it's fairly easy  
just made a quick design  
like this one curve on this side one curve on that side  
on the <unk> on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages  
ugh  
you're our marketing expert  
yeah  
yes  
okay  
yep  
hmm  
tape free  
yeah it was your second your first presentation  
with a good shape for the  
do you think it's something for the end of next year  
um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um m. p. three players now and that kind of thing  
but um  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
it doesn't really  
oh sorry  
r. s. i. sensitive  
i like this one  
okay but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost  
uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the t. v.  
i thought you were going for a single curve and  
image processing and stuff  
but we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird  
i personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber  
well it'll be after four then  
which is a shame 'cause it would've been cool  
true yeah  
mm-hmm  
if you have an l. c. d. display then mm you can select almost everything on the l. c. d. display  
i think that might be back to the start  
so we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting  
oh good  
yeah  
uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance acquaintance to uh to to ourselves  
they have um if you s. s. hey you know  
and the <unk> are and i'll draw this up on the board so we have a box  
mm this is not in the paper actually <unk>  
and so when all that was over they were answering me questions and the view switched again i <unk> they were sitting there in the interview going  
like  
we need a power source we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi functional  
so here we're missing soft component on the bottom  
i think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need  
um after that i got some new project requirements from project board so we're gonna go <unk> go after over this later  
yeah but there are much more nokia telephones than um these ones  
you are not convinced  
mm that's true yeah  
uh yeah  
to uh make fifty million euro  
mm-hmm  
yeah it does it doesn't really matter but  
thirty forty fifty  
yeah  
so can't we just basically extend it to thirteen  
oh no i can't write it in when it's in this setting  
and probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple  
or a regular  
well if you have like a hang on  
mm  
yeah  
also the slogan  
uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the l. c. d. actually giving a cover to that actually  
mm-hmm  
um  
right then  
yeah well this is basically in my three uh main jobs uh proposal uh um this  
i don't know what you think about that but  
go back  
to make more uh of an impression  
four weeks yeah  
mm-hmm  
so we can start  
but you know they all <unk> have the same role changing channels volumes and then programming  
mm-hmm  
sorry  
okay well not entirely but still i <unk> less than i usually do  
and double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction  
so you can have happy faces and angry faces  
yeah <unk> just some rules  
no  
um so first of all the method that i used was by doing some marketing research by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted  
and people uh the <unk> feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look hard look  
we have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy  
um i think it's what i tried to to do before it's the shared lounge uh th  
we were pretty democratic  
um i  
it was supposed to be pink  
four  
well when you're talking about gaming and stuff do you think they should have some sort of  
i was  
it's more like it gets you to the functionality but  
open c. yeah  
it's it's going to be li it's not going to be <unk> so easy but  
because a lot of people have a house cat  
ye  
i think the <unk> for me is the kind of thing i would use all the time  
and uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros so fifty percent of the selling price  
so uh this was kind of the lowest layer  
that that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in  
from  
'kay  
that's um  
thank you  
yeah maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip i think  
oh okay  
pro  
which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery kinetic or solar  
i mean we could  
and and colour  
that's it  
yeah  
alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations  
i don't know what you th guys think  
yeah  
uh but ease of use <unk> has to be insured throughout  
i take it that  
so we don't have it flip open  
you could also make line with uh yeah  
three or four  
mm-hmm  
then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh <unk> how this little box would uh look look like  
sorry what what actually are these is that the yellow and black  
the other one  
yeah  
okay  
yeah yeah  
'kay  
are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people  
but that's like i <unk> i suppose rather up to marketing and not to  
yeah  
no  
in different ye yellows  
yeah  
yeah  
so basically what you would like to check if is is is there some similarity in the in the in the aspect distribution  
should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device  
uh yeah  
okay  
i see it  
okay  
i guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface so it's kinda condensed into one  
i'd like i mean this is the just a prototype  
watch sky and yeah  
yeah and no internet  
mm-hmm  
you know the difference between infra red or radio waves  
blue tongue  
um  
uh i mean i suppose it we're as well to have it if we can  
so maybe a three or a four  
think so  
so do we just open the file as we open the files for the first pass like open up the sound file and then it <unk>  
um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons  
i got just very few and good ideas  
okay  
yeah right right  
great  
cool  
in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well so it's probably an interface that most people are used to  
yeah definitely yeah  
uh  
yeah  
mm  
i mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get would you how much would you pay  
i'm thinking the teenager  
yeah  
or  
even if you lose one you can just put whatever  
okay so the the <unk> uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group  
you can um call a <unk> <unk> between you and <unk>  
what was the oh yeah what was good  
but but t. v. <unk> don't have all uh  
mm  
maybe try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller  
it's the <unk> it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement  
it'd be it'd be cool but they are saying they've just developed it i'm just guessing  
could oh no you can't whilst that's up there  
why you why you you put it in the the side  
and that's it  
mm-hmm  
so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device  
i think  
but i there's not doesn't  
and if sabrina has any ideas we'd be happy to hear from sabrina as well  
some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't <unk> access their teletext  
yeah sure  
more uh uh look natural somehow  
they they don't  
so  
yeah  
'cause it's <unk> it's separate isn't it it's not part of the  
<unk> uh  
but even at distant point they're planning to use for <unk> uh standard d. s. m. or d. s. it's not  
no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand held and portable and uh <unk> i thought about other functions for t. v. but as you pointed out people don't actually want that  
yeah  
yeah  
you know  
so no l. c. d.  
so um that's kind of the end result hopefully  
and actually uh so when i was doing the re scoring experiments i was doing that on uh one meeting that i selected as being like the best looking one  
oh so it would be a narrow band detection a narrow band imaging detection  
okay  
fifty <unk> uh seventy five per cent of users say they <unk> zap a lot  
mm-hmm  
l. c. d. screen is easy because we have the l. c. d. screen we have the various options  
um i have two questions first is essentially how he's doing in that  
the case alone for uh remote control is at least one euro  
uh  
the audio is is is very bad  
or if it's not like a sony if it's like a i don't know  
um  
'kay  
um well uh we have the word document  
most of them will intuitively pick it up though  
and then add a  
well  
<unk> only <unk> one which surprised me a bit it was uh speaker recognition i think but it doesn't really matter  
plastic  
who  
hmm  
yeah they yeah yeah they want th they'll have backup in different and also in in some in underground  
there's no need to have that in the remote  
but it's not  
yeah i think this is easy now  
so if you say mute it says mute again and then it's um well i believe it's uh  
but uh but yeah the interface is very so the interface uses the output of your programme  
although can we make it with a regular chip  
going local  
okay just a second  
yeah it's  
well what would the option be  
possibly  
yeah  
and uh  
are the costs within the budget  
so you've got it installed in your machine here or  
stick that  
oh no  
it's to uh induce more television watching i suppose or  
okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes then  
uh  
okay  
but that's a human coding right  
so can we use any any frequency  
okay  
it sounds like maybe in another week  
so this table is uh two different things  
oh that's that's fine  
<unk> i think i think that the <unk> the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because <unk> if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional  
that's just the place  
because it's not a very current useful function  
so it's the number of different spots within that region where the eye has fixed the number of different fix oh <unk> okay  
my said that enough is enough  
okay  
could you please show the presentation number three  
then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium  
and all data are sent through the master  
yeah it's fashion because it's a fruit and we say that the yeah seven  
yeah but how many units did we need to to sell  
but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so i think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use  
uh <unk> you you came up with the voice recognition uh data  
okay  
maybe you  
we need only one battery  
mm-hmm  
and uh the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself  
this was actually an apple on the inside  
um  
um  
basically do a code for ease on it  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
right  
um i need you guys to work together on making a prototype um using um prototype building materials um  
hmm  
yeah sure  
uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a <unk> presentation of prototype of you two sounds interesting  
so there are two uh different types of uh um  
okay  
uh-huh  
i think you might lose a lot in you know this step  
uh the power button is used very much channel selection volume and teletext  
it looks like that beast from sesame street  
yeah  
mm 'cause uh from my previous experience we see <unk> analysis of information seeking dialogues over telephones  
right  
so  
so it's just defined only by wave length  
<unk> maybe  
it's about sixteen seventeen pounds i think  
uh brand independent  
okay  
did you see that this <unk> that this company we've made a spaceship  
hey bob  
yeah  
that was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else  
just looking  
so the battery is the in the sender  
so the <unk> wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want  
well because actually we have this project in common  
is basically to send messages to the television set for example  
yeah  
okay  
for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device  
oh project project documents yeah yeah yeah okay  
oh although i can't see it on my screen  
well i think we should approach it both ways  
we'll see  
but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too  
if you want the smaller if you want the smaller coding in in here  
yeah it's called a v. l. b. a.  
fifty percent on on i. m. two that's it  
um did anybody think anything was like really useful anything was pretty un <unk>  
just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on  
because they grab whatever is certain to work and they they use it  
well i also have um  
really minor you know like but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there  
channel  
so uh  
really  
a happy <unk> happy holidays  
yeah  
yeah  
sure sure sure  
i'll just get the <unk> presentation up and running  
i think even for <unk> yeah i think that would not work so well  
so c. p. u. itself may not be so  
and uh i don't know how they are  
um we've just about coped with the <unk> and digital pens uh i think the results speak for itself and new ideas found um  
and then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding 'kay what what are our options  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
that's th that's more difficult  
we are <unk> we are applying that hilbert uh him what is the <unk> uh stuff  
one is <unk> high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low okay  
i'm gonna save it  
what  
i mean that could just be a spring thing right now  
mm-hmm  
yeah right  
yeah  
we have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be  
think about a scenario where <unk> where you would use the scroll button for  
but where where did it uh where did you find that  
is it the the the effective size and weight that the is it uh real size real weight  
yeah  
that you can switch switch easy  
yeah but but the thing is if it's mel scaled if you have a mel scale  
but so at the moment the program is sort of in between working and not working because we've done lots of changes to what the error was  
yes  
nee  
and it will be very easy to find  
yeah  
oh oh  
so it  
and he <unk> he can and uh when do you intend to start writing the proposal  
well eyes and mouse  
don't have to be un breakable it's <unk> it's a it's not supposed to <unk> yeah break after one use  
ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time  
if everyone could go around and explain their role and um and their name  
okay  
these are the actual keys that are being pressed  
so maybe it's just like maybe <unk> it's just good to have like some generic component with three slide bars or something where we can relatively easily add a fourth one or something  
we <unk> we were thinking television  
oh yeah you're welcome  
but if you're watching a movie how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch  
we have half rubber half plastic  
right  
hmm  
huh  
how many pages  
mm  
yeah  
i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again  
<unk> it doesn't work any more  
i guess you've got you know one through nine  
i just know they're something to do with dolby  
yeah  
yeah and not really  
he don't start with the yeah he don't <unk> yeah start with gyro sample or something  
yeah  
you know i but i mean that's maybe the the limit to that  
ah  
yeah  
do you use a hand dynamo a battery kinetic or solar cells  
the next one  
uh something  
okay  
i <unk> i still like it  
i think this is not good but for we could make circular buttons for example  
mm 'kay  
it's just trendy basically  
should have good range  
yeah  
and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use <unk> uh sorry easy to use buttons  
the single  
no no no no for the real media  
so you don't have to  
mm  
yeah  
'cause then you could  
mm  
so th  
hard to lose yeah it <unk> and it's easy to find  
um uh more than uh sixty percent  
yeah  
we could now if that'd make up for it but really and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints  
more recently um i've worked on uh  
yeah  
yeah we should  
we can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it  
hopefully we can take over that right one 'cause we don't need it  
yes  
we have to discuss that point  
so um we already know that it'll just be for the television  
which might mm you might use the same methods as what we've been <unk> talking about today  
so  
mm  
but i <unk> i definitely don't think it's a five but  
specific details  
it has to be as good as possible  
just oh think of a catchy name  
we've got the dependability we've got you know the features that make this a unique product  
yeah and if we're if we're talking twenty five euros as a price that's not unaffordable even for young people  
um  
uh etcetera we <unk> new ideas found  
we're on to the pat on the back part of the  
'cause this is single curve this is curved on both sides  
i think we have to decide on this anyway  
i think the scroll wheel um  
and you guessed cats without a tail  
but i think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about  
and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels  
yeah and joystick i think  
but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there  
uh yeah  
yeah  
uh uh <unk>  
you know rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana you could make it kind of silver  
that's cool  
uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who <unk> which are not very use like <unk> uh <unk> channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but  
possibility  
yep  
<unk> been listening to too much  
well i don't know what to say  
so they'd be able to use that um as i said i think i i'd presume it would come up on the screen  
yeah yeah exactly  
the fewer buttons you have the <unk> <unk> the cheaper the circuit board yes  
yeah  
okay  
and how many text is in it  
mm-hmm  
six  
what but what's that button  
um  
uh just two just two under uh under uh  
can hold it  
you'll see in you email i guess  
glow in dark  
yellow  
yeah  
okay  
brilliant  
what we're talking about here  
okay  
but that's maybe a problem right because  
um so is everybody okay with any of that or do you want me to recap at all  
the work allocation page  
present and the colours  
okay uh  
yeah i mean i can remo  
so mm-hmm  
you should yeah  
like uh the uh uh price of a specific route  
yeah  
what's your experience with remote control  
hmm  
<unk> alright  
right  
um  
oh right  
um i definitely have to agree with that last comment  
now it's a swordfish  
volume hardly  
so on its great joy  
twelve dollar fifty  
final meeting market  
mm-hmm  
but i think they had that in mind  
and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now  
yeah maybe we can write it down say vis vis one  
this is really bizarre  
youngsters  
i think this would this would look cool  
yes <unk>  
um i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions  
i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip but that's not up to me to decide really  
the new remote control is to be original trendy and user friendly  
um close though  
mm-hmm  
yeah that'd probably be quite good  
not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view  
so i mean i wanted to put digits on the buttons as well  
it isn't uh a <unk> feature such as oh it's a process  
um i don't know what costs of it  
yep yeah  
but uh i think rubber compared is better  
uh okay definitely easy to use  
good morning  
you'll be just thinking about what it actually what you know  
yeah  
yeah oh yeah  
not good  
hmm  
my  
oh a button uh minus here plus over here  
so  
yeah  
actually so you have a standard t. v. remote where you have just a on off button and play  
yeah  
yeah  
if you're in the market for this ultimate remote you're not gonna go for just a television remote  
no not <unk> not not too much focus  
man  
but there is a moon  
right  
that's it  
mm-hmm  
excellent thank you  
and rubber  
yeah  
<unk> yeah but from memory that that basic script that they had wasn't wasn't very um effective  
uh is the project evaluated that is mine  
any text you just put in and  
so i mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that  
yeah  
mm uh i i don't think we have to be we have to agree on that  
i dunno how to how to do it if if <unk> if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the <unk> to the peeling or outside it  
are we back into project mood  
yeah i think it's it the it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping and stuff  
okay so i'm going to talk about trends and um i hope this can help us to to understand <unk> how we should design our remote control  
yeah  
do you want me to <unk> um  
uh  
yeah  
so uh don't make too much of it  
oh  
okay okay  
yeah  
but i do think it's more  
you too  
at participant one  
yeah  
where we uh  
oh  
um yeah  
so after that  
um and you'd mentioned i i was just gonna say could you reiterate the new project requirements  
i guess that  
yeah  
okay  
because you know shape is no longer an  
because we decided to have two kind of remotes two designs or was it two colours  
yeah  
<unk> a cat  
mm  
like here you look at the aspect set because you look at the similarity of two distribution  
if it could be done should be done  
but um  
mm  
you're not <unk>  
uh but they haven't done anything with it other than dump the data  
nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room  
it's really adaptable  
a power <unk> a power <unk> a <unk> a <unk> fruit  
okay  
i think i would give a five  
yeah which buttons do you want to in it  
yeah i think so  
yeah physically it is updated  
um  
no  
um  
'cause they'll have they'll have to have a central point anyway for for rotation and and grabbing  
this is the one  
uh no trend watching  
mm-hmm  
yeah but twelve and a half euros  
no but i'm gonna i'm going up appleton tower now and i have my external hard disk  
and we have only twenty of twelve and a half euro to make it  
uh in the the simple design you have them at a top and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom  
huh  
yeah  
they'll please the elder users as well  
mm-hmm  
people with arthritis and such  
and know whether we go down the fruit and <unk> route and i don't suggest we make it look like a banana  
no i'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that <unk> has given us the order to design this  
honestly i'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power i'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex  
but have have kinetic power i mean what does anybody think about that  
hmm  
yeah  
but  
yeah  
sorry mm yep  
oh something like that  
for the  
mm  
so  
mm-hmm  
but some somewhat bi bigger than small so you don't lose it that much anymore  
the what the top face right  
or making it less <unk> because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons  
so first it's your turn  
so you can't just do it by words because those two words completely specify into something or other  
yeah  
that would be <unk> seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different  
that's not very easy to use  
so we have to take some decision on this aspect  
i'll paint  
yeah  
yeah  
uh  
and we won't include a a pen or something to point hey we we want to do it with our fingers right  
yes  
the  
yeah  
this is the last meeting  
this is the the programme to to generating the x. m. l. file and the the shot  
um okay our agenda we're gonna do an opening i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting  
um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your yeah  
that's the same thing that i had in the beginning  
we just want to see what <unk> are on and what time it is probably  
oh okay  
yeah the notes notebooks  
<unk> by unusually  
i come from australia and we have nasty snakes  
well  
uh we should try running that thing again see what it does now  
have them in stock  
yeah  
light or i saw something like that  
we definitely know how it's powered we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons  
two  
not a of  
mm-hmm  
yes  
that that that everything is done through through the voice here you take a voice of someone and then you can get out this information  
hmm  
so i'm gonna look  
okay  
and the the added functions like <unk> snake it's under the parental control the touch screen  
a docking station is <unk>  
functional  
they're gonna love that one  
well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second which was twice as important as the third aspect  
uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control  
yeah yeah  
great  
we all had uh our talk and  
usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but i don't have red pen so  
yeah  
yeah  
case  
um  
yeah  
yeah so what you want to say is anyone who wants to give a talk on logic or philosophy of language  
it has nothing to do with uh audio processing and uh l. e. d.  
for each meeting  
let's take these semantic features into or these features into account and see how well we do with the the learning  
okay well right we'll have to um i'll we're <unk> having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit  
um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver  
mm-hmm  
um <unk> for which one are we going  
how  
so that's uh one thing to keep in mind  
no  
but it's diva we can say  
yeah  
<unk> debating  
well we'll we'll have to skip that part then  
and you don't think that can be done in open domain at all  
so that's what to start with for now is that alright you guys feel clear about this  
so  
so yeah yeah i yeah yeah  
i don't think it takes no it really does doesn't take time to learn i think  
yeah i know but that's what my information says  
but your  
and then you have to combine all this harmonic model and noise model  
there is some part there are there are separate movable parts on the screen ready for use right  
yeah  
um the trouble is i was just given this by finance  
okay  
ugly  
that does sound excessive  
i don't know  
yes yes  
someone more  
because you have lots of functions in it too  
they will <unk> yeah  
what do you think about it  
hmm  
now the finance  
yes  
all these dead linguists  
what's a turbo button  
yep  
i think that's sort of a line we should go by in general sort of saying yeah we could've done oh so many th  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
someone forgot the units there yeah uh unit price unit production price cost thing  
well we've got more than fifty cents  
but we have to reject that because of the requirements  
forty six and five fifty one  
whereas uh <unk> <unk> maybe we're talking <unk> like so so your data manager would that then handle the whole thing  
okay fine  
these are requirement specification  
when they decide to move it past the mold line they're <unk> doing something with it probably and you'll know what they're gonna do with it because  
it was quite good with this um the white board having that and the digital pens  
yeah  
or the back  
um i was sent some information from the company saying that they  
yeah  
um also so that's one of the main differences i think maybe one of the points that we have to talk about  
yeah  
or do we need ten days to go from  
yeah  
so we are  
two two point some two point something  
new stuff  
okay  
but i was busy enough anyway  
mm-hmm  
okay a three i see  
okay  
end report  
okay  
yeah yeah  
and then pitch  
so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on  
<unk>  
mm-hmm  
exactly so i associate them with like really low tech really cheap bad  
or the damped lyman alpha feature if you put feature there rather than data then you'd mark it  
well do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine  
we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very if it's gonna be a banana you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of  
hmm  
i know i felt like i needed to be professional so i didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff  
so how sure or unsure you are about the what's following our <unk> our context measures yeah  
yeah i. r. f. uh kind of structure  
that's strange because that's the same story  
mm-hmm  
remember that was a minimum requirement  
if you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control  
okay  
and so uh  
uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course  
i can move as far as  
the blue one f. n.  
a display uh is of course uh for showing letters  
and we do have the logo on it as well  
so  
yeah  
so the type of things i presented can lead to separation  
a rat  
the <unk> peak uh  
um  
oh right  
it's an interesting idea that if you press it for a long time it does something else in general  
yeah  
yeah but it's really complicated i think  
strange  
design a wireless remote control  
so in this case giving only one or two choices we are <unk> limiting our customers  
so uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important  
yep  
uh yeah yeah i see  
i i don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company  
as a hack you know like just as long as you then don't well probably people wouldn't know  
so we can launch it  
i have an idea of my job so yeah so  
she didn't know who  
okay fair enough  
good  
for all these function i put them on the  
and uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh <unk> so that's an a also an option  
okay  
um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a  
yeah we should do a little thing about design because it looks boring really to me  
like the power  
yeah  
see  
but associated means it's associated to some physical thing  
okay  
oh yeah it's red okay but  
yep  
it was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright  
yeah  
push buttons  
quick summary of the last uh meeting i can  
i don't think it's gonna get lost easily  
right  
but th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all it's just a straight out remote control  
to get a feeling for this  
okay  
um recognition possibility  
mm-hmm  
it's a shame  
but you don't wanna throw it away right  
well how um on the in this meeting then if we um  
i take it  
yeah  
um i have heard several things so i uh i'll have to change that on the way  
just start <unk> now  
yeah  
yep  
mm  
okay  
what part  
okay  
okay  
so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven  
uh plug yours in then  
so is this uh no that's not that i don't care  
yeah  
if it is recoverable we will tell you what is the quotation and if it is not recoverable we will send it back to you  
you have anything you wanna share quickly  
i don't know  
um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total  
um uh our from uh are of two sorts  
uh the tandem you plus minus half  
yeah  
say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation  
cheers  
yep  
because most <unk> most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room  
you know what i mean  
okay  
see you  
um okay interface the type and the supplements  
yeah it's <unk> kind of fun it was  
yeah  
so he decided to um to make more research on this topic  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r. r. like that  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um can we yeah like to and <unk> like do you have a  
oh okay  
mm-hmm  
if it had an a. on the end it would be the ne instrument  
yeah 'cause if yeah in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling just the way it would  
yes  
so you can have as many as you like uh and you can tell that they're close to each other  
took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see  
six is a good  
not anymore  
mm-hmm  
so what  
and then i'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs about uh what battery is in it what kind of buttons also  
like i think it's  
ah i think it's really up to us to  
so it's easier to hold in your hand to <unk> <unk>  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume  
so what we could do perhaps a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells  
it's not that complicated but i get it wrong every time  
but it's just if you want all <unk>  
is is the price okay  
okay  
uh covers  
speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
you are <unk> okay  
but there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard  
'cause that will save us one and a half euro already  
oh then then  
okay now i think we'll do this i could do you know i can do this <unk> on my own or i could do it with you  
yes it's a television remote control  
uh shall we  
uh this is the v. for volume but they're both uh a v.  
so <unk>  
we have an okay for scroll wheels  
with um but with a t. v. remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're <unk> saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five  
yep  
i think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given no  
indeed  
you know you want one for for the channel but you also want one for for the volume  
we'll draw two and then we'll see uh  
yeah  
yeah okay  
yeah i've got a if you load up my evaluation document  
right  
mm mm um nor would changing the case materials  
and they also have a longer battery life than most batteries  
and <unk>  
um and yeah and oh yeah and see uh looks at looks at objects and looks whatever else  
well i guess i we'll have to go for single curve then  
no or the other way around  
yeah  
scary  
i really like that kinetic battery though  
so let's go for the the lunch break and  
sixteen times zero  
how would  
oh yeah  
so that's basically uh what i had in mind  
yeah con contrast is  
yeah something <unk> i mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy maybe  
i think he did some uh  
in my next life  
okay  
right  
<unk> <unk> you said five  
um  
okay  
we had two things from their stuff just to make sure that we are like understand it we understand it enough to to <unk> modify it  
see if we have to put on some restraints  
yeah  
yeah but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something  
mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t. v. next and share prices and that kind of thing  
um each meeting and i just put one in each category  
uh-huh  
perfect  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
you don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote  
uh but uh with <unk> sorry this was maybe uh his concern  
oh and i guess i'm the industrial designer on this project  
maybe they can  
that's just the wrong <unk> that's just this should be a source name  
and there are some <unk> imp  
well i it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive  
yeah  
okay  
and then we can get a docking station  
okay okay  
um  
yeah  
and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options  
oh yes i see him good yes  
like you know that's just one booklet that came with one set of <unk>  
yeah just uh just an idea about how to <unk> th that could also be possible  
yeah  
i didn't discuss anything with sunil also like i dunno technical discussions anything  
um well we even seem to have uh hand <unk> <unk> for uh powering our uh remote controls  
oh it's okay  
can we <unk> can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one  
but that's not really uh  
we're finally getting somewhere hopefully  
yeah  
that might have made it <unk> 'cause i i appear to have nothing  
uh i i don't know regarding h. e. v. s.  
yeah  
or is there anything that yous thought <unk> really would stand out compared to the others  
download it uh to the to this remote control  
it's you've gotta hold it in one hand  
i love to draw ants  
yeah <unk> or <unk> or something you mean  
i'm a away from  
uh i suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space for example  
and we might i mean depending on what comes out of the design we might have to stick to just black buttons  
okay  
no  
mm-hmm  
'kay  
they they insert over  
the i. d. is going to do the look and feel design the u. i. d. the user interface design  
yeah i'll i'll say two  
i i really don't like this <unk> clay 'cause you know it makes some for for i dunno uh yeah um we'll look  
yeah  
just think of the problem  
so we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say  
i think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic  
but the  
the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons like the buttons on one side for the channel  
no just i i would i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands  
who wrote that one  
no we put the electronics into the fashion  
well yeah you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control  
i'm trying to actually find out what's being said so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps  
and uh what happens if if you put them here on around the table  
yeah yeah in that one right yeah  
on some web pages to find some documentation and i think a remote control is as i <unk> mentioned previously  
wrong job  
i'll go through the <unk> through the minutes first  
yes  
alright  
so we have to have uh something like that like we uh  
six six six point five  
they're not used much  
and the the length of the time frame has um an inference of uh on uh which parameters  
but we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down  
yep  
well i have a <unk> <unk> presentation stored in my  
one and a half  
so there must be somebody with a folk wisdom you can contact  
okay  
so even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype we wouldn't have been able to  
right  
and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros okay  
yeah  
like put the guess down or leave it as ambiguous in some way  
well i don't have um i haven't looked for uh for information about it  
i do not really need to this just says look at the <unk>  
'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting  
what  
make a yellow well to make a banana  
um with this other drop down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we  
so we will have the data from a. from b. and from c. and so on  
because when you use yeah you get <unk> when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television  
um  
i said i'm your project manager um  
yeah i've had a <unk> i've had a look at the the topic segments how it's stored  
you could um we could hook it up  
because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way  
yeah  
and here's what we're each of us going to do  
uh yes it should be  
yeah  
'kay  
that'd be weird  
mm-hmm  
um  
um  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
the <unk> ease of use of the device might make up for that  
case material is rubber and it's a special colour but that's important  
that's nice  
yeah  
<unk> yeah okay  
uh very special uh next uh session  
have you have you completed it  
but  
to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment  
okay  
yeah  
lapel  
this one  
uh uh uh i think we should go for the easier one  
yeah  
yeah okay  
yeah  
they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t. v. and they watch of <unk> four of them at the most  
oh yeah i think that's very doable  
if you got a no  
that's what i call painting  
yep  
alright  
market range internationally sold  
oh yeah  
and uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels  
i mean that depends upon your design so  
i myself i find when you <unk> when there's something like <unk> speech recognition  
yeah 'cause the sample speaker was i think more complicated then just a beeping thing  
yeah  
yeah that's right  
i really like using commas  
no  
i haven't looked <unk> one time directly at the camera  
yeah without the energy yeah  
'cause if we're gonna allow disjoint segments for example then how are we gonna know what's gonna be in context at any given time  
okay  
yeah well it's a good question  
then you'll have to <unk> uh see the menu on the television  
i think there should be a break for and  
what's this  
do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un plus and um push plus twenty times  
you could point to damped lyman alpha though  
your stereo and your t. v. and uh  
and then the fact that we also invite people from the informatics i suppose it's just that we do have pretty strong ties with them  
uh make it uh rather thick on the top because uh on the top it has uh the screen  
oh yeah yeah  
gosh  
yeah  
no  
not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal but just that i think they're <unk>  
well that's bit of a problem because i re but i really don't understand that because i can imagine a remote control with far more push buttons  
a rabbit i think  
yeah  
th the menu menu button is also important  
i think it works that way really  
okay six point five  
yeah  
<unk> sorry i'm imposing  
well  
that sounds too it's possible but uh i think it's expensive but do continue  
but for example i have uh i receive some new project  
yeah this is  
more efficiently i think  
yeah it's okay  
for example we have twenty topics and um for one of these topics there are five occurrences and we have one word that  
yeah  
yes sure  
station page  
so i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls  
because time delay is is too short to be compared or can be neglected  
yeah i think  
so so take out teletext  
or <unk> is it just one  
one two  
right where um where's the power button  
and um a special  
or maybe we can say <unk> seven is the best mm  
i think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a <unk> way that just looks a bit more kind of  
i mean and to ask questions like who disagreed or were there any counter proposals or whatever  
yeah all the processing is done the t. v. is a <unk> has some processing power the  
it doesn't necessarily replace the entire top  
so this is that we <unk> that that we should target  
you know if we fit this requirement  
okay well that's all details  
<unk>  
but also includes things like like  
yeah and give that room to <unk> some professor with a student or from for visitor with the visiting place or  
and it's always the other way around that's how you put it on  
instead of play stop rewind and fast forward there that's up down louder and quieter  
i wrote it down here what to do um  
and what could happen if you don't even have your  
so one speaker had um an average of about a hun one hundred um in one meeting and one hundred sixty in another meeting that's really that's strange  
just to make sense of a sentence  
th that's very good  
room  
yeah  
i do  
much easier yeah  
seven yeah it's terribly sexy  
he's crying because it's <unk> because of his ugliness  
um  
right  
fancy looking  
you know  
yeah for the batteries  
so we cannot just uh  
uh i've got here in uh i will put a i will put a page on it  
how to relate the remote control device like for example this one i <unk> i'm holding in my hand and the t. v.  
<unk>  
uh on the l. c. d. we <unk> you know the main menu will have various options  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
those are two really uh user interface  
so since then  
uh you go to the table you have there like the big table you told and then we can discuss  
so are we through the technical part then  
and if we think that what we are <unk> our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel  
uh i figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive  
so let me see what are we i mean oh yes sorry four point three  
it's fine twelve fifty uh  
um  
well i i would say a five or a six  
um i probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful  
yeah  
it's the  
a little bit  
ah  
let's plug you in baby  
yeah already having the <unk> stuff helped a lot  
exactly  
what we're going to do and how we're going to do it  
yeah  
yeah  
i <unk> it were that there were panel discussions only at the place where i could see the the <unk> <unk> you know  
uh i don't know about anything like this but  
and this isn't a separate thing so i <unk> i would agree that you underline the you underline the goo in each case but not the and  
um i wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours  
no  
so what kind of change will you impose on the <unk>  
i think it's i think it's easy to implement a button with a <unk> <unk> what which especially do that because some t. v. <unk>  
yeah  
yeah in a breath it's  
yeah but i <unk> uh but it's i i know for sure that some televisions that <unk> th th the remote control supplied  
on mine it complains about  
that's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things  
says  
and then uh i will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon  
mm mm  
that can come under <unk> as well  
um  
<unk> you can put it on chip anyway so uh  
um and and they want it only to cover televisions  
okay so we are just waiting for matthew  
well depends  
yeah  
okay  
but i'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that i don't know about  
hmm  
so i think it was  
so you can uh yeah change uh <unk> make it more trendy for for younger people  
the remote control is beautiful  
right well th yeah th that's in the the manual  
yeah  
let's work on the other stuff first like the other stuff  
uh that's right  
okay  
it's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat but i love cats  
seeing as we've got you know we've made it a a special form  
oh yeah  
yeah  
okay so <unk> where did you say in <unk>  
fair enough  
yeah  
it <unk> it <unk> should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone and it is i has something nice  
mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people <unk> th looked at it and say right  
and uh they do only audio and video  
yeah  
no  
okay ready for the next slide  
but that that makes it cheap  
yeah it's a lot of pressure  
yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost  
but it's  
and <unk>  
but it's uh i mean uh this <unk> might be more easy to do for the client by the client  
then um we then i think the convention was that we still that you still would mark that  
we're tempered by that yes  
yeah  
that way  
raise hell when you remove it too far from the television  
'cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls  
yeah you can press the next button which is uh yeah  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
um yeah i i thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries  
yeah so  
yeah  
but uh  
and um i think we uh stop for lunch now  
it's a kind of filtering already  
yeah  
is there enough room for creativity  
it it if it was if it was some other <unk> feature and then absorbers  
um so i've tried to take a whole lot of market research and <unk> it for us  
scroll options yeah  
okay  
yeah <unk>  
<unk>  
so if you have to say up up up up  
oops  
i've just i've just switched them around  
but you can make a screen shot i think  
hmm  
if you do have this <unk> speech interface to it you don't even need to find it  
yep  
mm-hmm  
um what about leadership  
yeah  
yes  
do do you  
i mean why not have a little rounded kind of thing it could still have the basic buttons on it  
so there is a. s. r. decoder which could be there and then there could be another scroll button scroll <unk>  
that one  
oh yeah  
okay  
do we do we want uh  
well that's another option  
sure  
yeah  
telling the difference between intentional and unintentional <unk>  
okay  
mm  
you're also gonna have the channel tuner as it were  
okay  
seems important  
mm mm mm  
yeah  
that's pretty cool  
yeah  
that's what they said in the master class  
i don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet  
yeah  
right  
uh  
this will be the main new issue and uh well  
and they're all numbered  
oh what  
mm  
we'd be just our model of <unk> of <unk> remote control  
um no  
okay  
yeah that's true  
mm-hmm  
um  
so you start i think right  
maybe that could be voice activated too  
mm-hmm  
you probably have to do a bit of  
mm  
okay  
using that technology  
okay that's fine  
and so  
and galaxies  
but i really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy where you have to move the thing to be able to use it  
it's just like <unk> until the information density is up and running  
yeah it's okay  
no you don't  
um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout  
um i think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel  
you'll have to search for it  
mm-hmm  
uh yeah  
can i see scores  
mm mm mm  
but we have  
and uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons infrared led etcetera for the components um  
but it's the case you put around it that makes the shape  
and might might be an interesting exercise right  
yeah  
oh  
indicator  
yeah exactly  
ah now this is one  
if it was a  
'kay  
because it  
so it's just like  
so uh set up your t. v. set like channels that you use they're one  
um  
durable use  
partitioned off and stuff yeah that was him  
so you all know me i'm the industrial designer  
yes 'cause it i was just i was just checking you know like how far apart are they  
yeah  
did you like 'em  
but for remotes yeah  
yeah and you you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit and it gives a faint glow  
it's in the middle of one of the little r. <unk>  
yeah  
wow  
um  
okay  
yep  
you know like  
mm  
alright what's what i in is this the only way that we go about it or are there other thin  
yeah yeah okay but i <unk> i i don't know if nor <unk> <unk> it's quite a simple l. c. d.  
what were we saying about nebula  
so it's either um the scroll wheel or the push buttons  
we don't have we're not using any of that  
yep good  
well i uh i also  
yeah  
and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much  
mm  
get sucked in  
coming up with what  
mm  
one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be  
and what i'm thinking about maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um i mean this is how you hold a remote control  
or because if it only directs at the t. v. then you only have uh i don't know what you want to do with the l. c. d. screen  
the supplement is  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah teletext  
yep  
yeah  
uh did you all receive that email  
like uh large icons or small icons and  
yeah  
yeah  
but what do we say  
um any questions well just just let me know  
how advanced are we gonna have our search  
yeah yeah it's we got two good score  
'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it 'cause they want to look at it  
your individual action you can find them in the email  
yeah it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect  
yeah  
so at least if we can recover we we can read some of his stuff or something  
okay  
i thought went well  
what about him  
but it should be  
um  
it should all be  
so you can download from the voice from the web festival  
push the screw  
ah  
sometimes i have these pop ups or these sounds and there's nothing there  
um <unk> would make to sales  
clock or  
so some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no  
uh that was what you were <unk> remarking about  
technically speaking it's not as advanced but it does the job too  
and um talk about our finances whether we were under or over our budget  
mm-hmm  
because he did the movie so he wants <unk> okay to archive he wants to okay  
no no but that that was the guy who's on a wheelchair now  
i'll do so  
okay so so we have the option for more functions  
uh so but uh it should be the yeah the audio signal should be coming out the speakers once it's set up properly  
yeah  
yeah  
uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume  
yep  
so anything uh more about lisbon or <unk>  
as one meeting yeah  
we should just go through this quickly and then  
finding the java media the java x. media stuff on all the jars for that  
'cause you'd reckon that you could leave them in and they would never show up in a summary anyway  
no we're kidding  
uh-huh  
so are you concerned about it that i should be looking at it or you happy with it  
oh <unk> you perhaps you should make it a bit big so people know it's there and uh  
so starting off with the um last the last one oh i don't have it here um but we talked about energy  
right  
okay  
mm-hmm probably colour or sharpness  
yeah  
we have some we have some ideas and some uh  
that's all part of the name  
so that won't be uh our goal i think  
but toilet paper roll and uh  
okay right  
okay  
oh right  
twelve thirty  
yeah  
so we will have the three presentations from the  
it really is  
mm yeah  
um although i'm sure you've actually got some of the information already  
yep  
mm-hmm  
contrast contra well  
uh typically it would be a battery but i'm open to suggestions  
with the scroll thing on like this  
i hated to draw like that  
mm-hmm  
my design  
probably  
yeah it's not accurate  
to the left is volume down  
yeah  
i've got no idea what it means  
sued the beatles so  
yeah where it draws  
you don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing  
yeah if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured  
alright  
and that's all calculated off line  
but it doesn't matter  
our best bet  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah you can you can easily yes i <unk> i've tried  
we need to be  
yes  
i rounded it up far too fast  
i think the  
yeah  
i if this is your detail or i should use a different  
so um i don't think we have any <unk> there  
mm  
yeah  
better instructions  
there are two curves right  
okay and still we have mm can we still include the l. l. s. d. display  
so we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can  
mm  
okay  
um <unk> there's a missing false start here um that didn't get caught  
yeah i think so yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i mean the things we could ask uh but i would yeah  
yeah uh the remote score  
we're choosing a latex case <unk> in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on screen menu  
so uh  
and and for the materials that is cheap to produce i think uh it's quite clear from yeah  
mm  
it's feature of the spectrum which is different  
mm-hmm  
i think we're done right  
yeah  
yeah  
and then we can decide what what we can yeah  
and i was wondering whether so if you well though of course it's true that it's mainly water  
that should be fun  
uh another colour maybe  
it's exact the same thing  
menu okay  
yeah uh  
uh technologically innovative  
um <unk> base dot times  
we don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to <unk> market or something  
hmm  
there are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got  
mm-hmm  
yeah but just flying saucer or  
yeah  
um i suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at i guess  
but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing  
great  
project process  
with technical  
well findings  
yeah  
it's it's not doing it's not doing it in the <unk> <unk> at the moment  
colour well uh <unk> the expert on colour  
yeah we'll discuss a <unk> a fly or do we'll do another meeting <unk> on elephants  
yes  
is it just it just sometime dangerous to say th these latent aspects means this  
yeah certainly of course  
we should take it take it <unk> to consideration to build an l. c. d. screen in it  
like how long will people want to mill around for looking at  
i'm still the secretary  
yeah name  
i don't know how how you would like us to proceed from from here or if you already have questions or reactions on this one  
if you're watching it the l. c. d. screen blah blah  
sorry i did this in a bit of a rush  
mm  
'cause that's something to consider i guess if we're if we're using more advanced technology it might  
and then it has to also be technologically innovative and yet easy to use  
yep  
ah of course sorry  
this this kinda touches on your comments there david  
oh okay  
i say don't use it and the control just looks  
yeah  
okay  
hmm  
oh  
but i <unk> i don't  
<unk> you <unk> you turn you turn it so  
um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like  
okay  
you're the boss you're allowed to  
yeah you can do whatever uh any uh cloth  
oh my god  
so what i basically got is i just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities  
seven's <unk> four is neutral okay  
so you right  
yeah i don't know  
sorry do you mind passing me my <unk>  
yeah maybe  
well you you stay a five minutes  
okay  
no okay but but  
yeah especially features like suppose if somebody come with different good features again people <unk> again use m. f. c. c. <unk>  
something what also younger people want  
yeah but a <unk>  
i mean once they get used to it  
but that would be a good way to to get in the whole um r. s. i. issue in there  
mm-hmm  
but maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides  
it's a it's a cat  
true  
so i i would need separate files for each segment or just maybe have <unk> <unk> each segment  
it's mango  
do you have any quest  
if this is our docking station we can make our logo over here  
push buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive but do add extra cost  
so i mean we've got we got rid of the rubber case but  
cost is  
do you do you need to double click on that to open it  
maybe to improve the recognition that way is not uh something you can expect  
or a button for all the magazines all the information documentary tonight  
and wouldn't that differ from person to person  
but is it worth any effort though i mean  
yeah  
okay that was just to get to know each other have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project so  
trigger  
oh the <unk> yeah but then you can you have to use <unk> with one hand  
people  
you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it so you're basically pressing  
mm  
i dunno  
i mean you may take it into account and say no you're wrong and here's why but i i i'm gonna need some convincing  
um yeah i think i think it's i think it's good  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
it's we need it anyway  
a four also because except for the wheel we don't have so much innovation  
happily satisfied  
mm 'kay um  
so we're okay i think  
it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere maybe yeah i dunno  
they could be interchangeable they're spongy that goes back to ergonomic  
that's in the presentation so  
so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on if we have to kind of  
yeah yeah  
um well  
yeah  
yeah  
in file menu  
covers or something so  
hmm  
you have the switch turn it on infrared bulb  
but we th that should be design  
what is it  
oh yeah  
i know  
i <unk> you us yeah yeah  
yeah that's just basically what i just showed  
course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that  
it's twenty five after two at the moment so forty minutes is five after three um which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us  
ca can you try to  
okay  
yeah that that could be interesting to try to merge those two uh things  
when you stay in it's good when you don't stay in you have to redesign  
so small world network mean basically some far links but generally very clustered locally  
okay  
one the one hand uh  
yeah  
hmm  
so we'll just crack on um like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible  
mm 'kay  
i wouldn't call it training but  
like that's something that made it a little easier  
now we worked through each other something he said yeah and you had information i also had  
it is definitely po  
but uh two <unk> but uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings  
yeah  
so we should make it too complex  
um and you'll all get specific instructions as well  
'cause one problem if you use energy based methods which is probably more uh the thing you've been using so far  
well and how about my idea uh of making it um  
are we supposed to count to ten or something  
um  
this was it  
if that's possible  
yay yeah  
<unk> next uh slide  
this not for end of next year  
i think that was brought up for um they're basically quite a flexible design modern you don't have to use individual buttons  
yeah  
so where  
so for the energy source do we go for the battery or the  
hmm  
yes  
yeah  
non native speaker  
so while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design  
we have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous and i don't know what that is  
consistency  
yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing  
just what what  
yeah well i think it's uh fair enough  
yeah of course  
yeah three point five  
given that fifty percent of the words are not actually interesting  
yeah can we <unk> can we get to that i  
um because  
yeah it is  
yeah but i don't i think it they are two different things though  
yes and uh then another one that would perhaps give the actual probability value  
it did yeah  
because this is yes this is one this can be considered as one <unk> intervention  
yeah  
yep  
yeah  
uh  
uh-huh  
it's fast no  
we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work  
great  
but number within the x. m. l. context  
i mean they are working with software and hard both our software and hardware  
yeah but it use the same data  
i feel like  
that's why i say i quest i <unk> i question the marketability of the product  
but um  
mm-hmm  
i think we can implement more functions then because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more  
so is it just okay  
if you if you start with uh fancy fruits and <unk> <unk> and <unk>  
well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control  
yeah  
<unk> sort of a second  
it is handy  
so next slide please  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
no  
and uh a wheel on the top  
oh go ahead  
and in fact if they they can go a lot but you know  
yeah okay  
uh you can do one thing  
mm-hmm  
but i think it should be a bit longer perhaps  
which would allow the user to select just the shots and give names  
hmm  
oh brilliant  
but but sometimes you put a  
are they all gonna have our company logo on them  
then we'll have to <unk> decide about the control the remote control concepts  
manuel you'll be working on the look and feel design  
huh  
well i th i think you two uh especially you and uh and uh daniel  
that's something that can uh be done for example  
just press next  
mm mm  
so  
okay  
uh here's some kind of chip  
thank you  
okay  
so uh i guess you want to know what you could do with an array maybe  
so we scrap that  
forget that  
i think the channels  
well yeah mo uh mo yeah well most of them are right handed  
is there any fruit that is spongy  
thank you all for coming  
uh this is another systems thing  
yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost  
uh  
yeah the r. and another r.  
after we came up with um some general ideas of our design  
um i'm all for them actually i think they're quite you know th very quick to <unk> to use  
uh but for this experiment it's just the <unk> type uh task  
i don't really mind  
<unk>  
so for that case yeah uh yeah so this might be a weak definition of interactivity  
so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh  
so the no  
so you found your spots  
then that is not a special colour that's a that's a standard colour  
it's not saying  
so we've moved over and onto the other eye link  
and you are user interface yeah  
yeah we  
one  
mm  
yeah alright  
i'm thinking curved of some sort  
'cause uh  
i would think so because you'd have to develop a base  
but can't see it taking long again  
that's probably your <unk> description  
um the interface designer um i would like to the next meeting i would like to receive the uh components concept  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah  
so even if we increase our cost little bit within uh some limits and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook  
yeah  
oh right it is there  
how to select the next or here  
um the the the industrial uh designer has to uh look at the working design  
mm-hmm  
so you have the transmitter here for example  
uh-huh  
but  
but it's just a speaker right  
this was mike's prototype and <unk> you seemed to agreed on it  
right  
yes yes you can you can still  
but um because we've got the the l. c. d. and the jog dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume  
okay it's not good quality  
well we're aiming for um one for all of them  
okay we <unk> we can hold on for a minute  
it just means it loads on demand  
what's the use uh of the <unk> turbo button already  
mm  
so that's for me  
but what's the does it always just oh no it's it's referencing to several word structures  
so the case  
oh right  
by  
yeah  
so it's that non vocal sound one here  
uh rubber or plastic  
uh content <unk> or channels  
mm  
as you know our company is quite big and uh so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well  
go ahead  
and i think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look  
uh and the next slide  
it becomes tangible  
yeah  
and then you have lots of people telling you i consider those marbles as very uh have to have very salient feature that they share in common  
dark colours simple <unk> shapes  
carry the laptops back again  
back to the topic  
i have my code already  
no no  
yeah  
yeah  
do the also with the thumb  
in terms of um you can have like uh a two second utterance uh credit cards and then twenty seconds of silence coming after it  
it can be done yeah  
no  
okay  
i'll make it  
you like the buttons  
mm-hmm  
yeah i think so  
double rooms  
ah  
that sounds quite reasonable  
so uh um <unk> other findings um some new things um used uh some of them were mentioned already by our technical um designer uh  
mm  
yeah sounds  
um these are our minutes from <unk> the functional design  
yeah it should be easy to work with  
he can't even say it on a microphone here i heard  
just um before i bring this up what i'll just say is um what i've what i've done is tried to collect some information so that i can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing  
not not too uh yeah  
yeah  
if we do it we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile  
for the the linear prediction model  
but we <unk> we keep adjusting to the fashion  
and i can't figure out any way to just approve messages from her without her subscribing at that account  
so to conclude what we are doing is uh we estimate how much of the frequency spectrum you are occupying when you speak  
i think it's a bad idea frankly  
i'll just finish up real soon because i'm  
i don't know i mean uh you'd be you tried sinusoidal coding based approaches didn't you  
so i can take i think mine now there  
oh you can push push it again you can push it  
yeah  
can this plug come across  
so dave are you gonna make something primitive that people can load their data in  
now i if we look at fashion in general um  
yeah  
right  
it's a big bump in the soft bit  
i mean unfortunately th <unk> there is nothing true  
uh first of all the case the case the surrounding of the of the the remote control  
well it would be <unk>  
um so  
i if it doesn't affect the price  
um so if uh i'll have a look  
try the power button  
they like spongy material like yeah a sponge ball  
it's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before  
it's just you put them in a hash table and and say well if it exists already in the hash table then you increase the count by one and i'll probably implement some filter for filtering out numbers or something  
probably watch too much sponge bob  
okay  
can we conceive of leaving them out  
light  
you know turn on off switch the channels and the volume and things such as that  
yeah definitely it's <unk>  
there was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them  
so my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use  
ah okay  
you <unk> yeah  
there's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual  
and um well they're cheap so we could use them now  
oh you mean um uh <unk> on the october thing  
that's just  
make make yeah  
nearly  
uh if you go to next slide you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface  
there you go tara  
normal scroll wheel  
if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five  
it seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote  
um probably yeah  
and you don't have to worry with replacing a. a. batteries which are  
no no no  
yep  
alright  
yeah  
so some menus  
um  
sorry  
um yeah i i don't know how about you with your words  
okay  
nothing more  
i mean next channel  
or can move between positions in the in the number  
but what do you then suggest we'd lose  
it's already  
well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you <unk> you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental  
blank  
is a battery like  
we wouldn't mark absorbers no  
with one single curve  
but there you could send an s. m. s. i think or something like that  
then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements  
mm-hmm  
ah it's on  
is the device <unk> flashy and fashionable  
yes in fact uh for now we are using uh a kind of calibration but uh it's still um  
so  
so  
yeah that's the addendum in the construct should be you know kind of they they change their true identity  
and uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables  
so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions what we want on this portable device  
so we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries  
yeah  
so this would be an example of bad layout  
oh yep  
okay  
yeah  
but then after suddenly if you go from one frame and you try to match all the points here with like a translation  
yes  
<unk> not many buttons and uh and uh uh <unk> <unk> buttons  
what's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and l. c. d. screens in remote control  
yeah  
um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there  
uh da today  
um that thing should be central  
so as we can see that's way too expensive down here  
yeah i'm  
um  
ye ah it's it's okay  
well the original  
what kinda battery would we want to use  
<unk> just the price  
yeah  
yeah in the raw text index directory  
mm-hmm  
something that might be quite cool is if you could um you know like some applications when you open a file you get like a little preview  
uh i did some trend watching  
three is fine with me  
um dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind  
yeah but you'd probably look at each meeting as a document  
right  
the features and the cost  
um smart chip that perverts uh that permits sorry universal application again  
yeah  
i thought it was okay but the advanced uh settings um screen audio and channel  
um your idea of the u. s. b. would i think would largely depend on the cost  
we've <unk> built in the the speech where are you function  
the problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five  
okay good  
it's a cat  
do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that  
so we'd either have a small l. c. d. display on the device itself  
no  
whoosh  
well <unk>  
um  
and i'm not certain i would  
yeah that's there no no up up  
i don't know  
yeah  
chill  
yeah  
yeah you're able to do that in java yeah  
sure  
yeah  
mm-hmm the <unk> digital pens  
yeah  
well so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range  
not so difficult  
then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work and um  
alright  
<unk>  
and that's on the camera  
well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to  
yeah  
uh  
um the buttons there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer  
which is in uh some sense quite simple for voiced speech signal say  
the wood thing  
well in in in the right top corner  
oh right okay  
so this comes to eighteen  
hmm  
something really cool  
and then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing  
with a visitor space yeah  
yeah  
okay  
i like the idea of speech recognition that's a great idea  
yeah  
i thought that was  
oh i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel  
yep that's true  
your line broke  
then you have plenty of time to recharge it of put it in a <unk>  
but  
oh  
so i have here an  
sort of flat as possible  
so that might be that <unk> will be at the soonest as uh a ultimate expert on on the whole thing  
i missed out that  
so  
or you have to <unk>  
mm 'kay  
or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day that it'll die on you and no way to do it  
yeah  
th th that's very handy i i always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of <unk> the number  
unfortunately  
mm  
if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay curved or double curved  
um but they seem to always be marking them that um uh after verbs you know with clause <unk> uh it's very it looks quite mechanical  
but that's that was just an idea i had  
this is a question question  
well potentially yeah um  
hmm  
and that it shouldn't be too small mm that it it gets lost  
um yeah  
mm-hmm  
you know where are you  
yeah  
<unk> no but the if you give it <unk> depends on the <unk> like the user how much effort he can put  
like it's not <unk> text to speech it's just the uh uh synthesis which means which is more or less the same but i dunno  
or whatever would be technologically reasonable  
there's no but there's no way to do that because we cannot implement that kind of the system  
yeah yeah it's okay  
<unk>  
this was a a sign criteria do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then  
um  
yeah okay  
yes but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television  
that's quite a small thing she can do for you i guess  
okay  
no <unk> may no maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh u. s. b. or a <unk> connection  
this is like advertisement  
yeah  
it's now single curved  
but th th but th yeah th <unk> the these were all minor minor uh minor details  
supplement you  
right  
so just like that  
uh both  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
so okay  
okay  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
okay  
okay um the case what does it mean by single and double do you know  
i mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel  
file with whatever hierarchical structure we want  
yeah i mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view  
yeah  
um biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed  
yeah  
people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext  
and now it easy to use  
and i also  
let's whatever's easiest for you  
uh  
what does it end with  
nice  
yeah you could you could <unk> have people want uh want that  
and  
which i mean sort of like if if you if you were to resolve these kind of uh cases in order to put them say in a database or so  
yeah i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of  
well okay so in terms of elegant fancy  
okay  
that's price but <unk> <unk>  
mm  
yeah i kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it  
mm-hmm  
an l. e. d. which is a light emitting diode um contact discs for the buttons  
so  
i used it too but oh well  
so have to write my report now i guess  
mm yeah  
oh right  
of course not  
mushroom  
uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah  
stupid stupid pen but uh  
perfect yeah  
uh  
phew  
i dunno  
yeah i <unk> i would actually go for the  
adapt  
so we could provide  
yeah  
and you are in the <unk> use user interface uh design  
that's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really  
okay  
that i that is possible yep  
yeah  
it would make sense if you could  
right  
yeah yeah it  
i'm gonna write that down  
you're probably right  
i dunno like a six or something  
okay  
yeah  
plastic <unk> or rubber even as well  
yeah  
it's a great feature  
maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions  
nothing  
okay  
sales  
so um i'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs that we start with the customer  
i mean you got that email  
previous  
leap  
but uh and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours but may i dunno if that's important but we'll talk about that later  
we have to uh  
but let us know because we can retrieve the the other files  
but we're not allowed  
yeah  
right  
switching channels um yeah  
i th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just <unk> variables  
there is something read importance with a zero and there is read word importance with a one  
<unk> uh-huh  
uh is it complicated  
yeah  
i mean there is a <unk> difference but it's probably not significant enough to really make use of it  
yeah  
well but maybe let's stick to the <unk> spongy thing like one unit  
can we do marketing piloting too  
so  
i don't know or uh i don't know how you  
if uh  
okay so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here  
mm but the the problem that i found when i ran it  
mm-hmm  
right good point  
right  
or you won't sell it  
there's virtually <unk> the way that you frame you know the windows badge on there it really doesn't matter what colour it is  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
exactly  
yeah  
whatever  
do you think  
oh i already erased half of the line  
so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that  
uh  
again uh that that should be you should be able to derive that presumably from  
well i guess i'm not with it because i wasn't but it's it's being used fourteen times an hour  
yes but you have to <unk> uh be able to change it  
well i guess the important thing is to get the crucial <unk> modules built  
it's the stalk of the banana or it's just the thing at the end of this version  
oh wait a minute  
but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks  
yes  
great  
okay  
i mean the <unk> yeah  
and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max  
yeah  
oh yeah  
and if you <unk> you push <unk> children uh you don't have to uh log in but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh okay  
yeah  
and you have some page which are <unk> but you have links between those two  
but that's already possible  
and the other question is if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market  
so it would be like this  
okay yeah  
he doesn't send  
mm-hmm yeah  
um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers i think um because they're the easiest to draw  
we're gonna need a scroll um  
uh black's okay  
yeah  
it's got a big picture of a car uh  
four  
yeah but imagine you <unk>  
yeah well sure  
no  
okay  
celebration  
so is that what it means in that <unk> context  
okay  
oh yeah  
i don't th it will be rolling a lot  
is a is an object  
okay  
yeah  
so  
so uh  
yeah hi and then you can use it  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
that's the one thing i'm also afraid of with this one because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example  
'cause you <unk>  
just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits  
yeah  
right  
okay so um <unk> <unk> been lots of missed filled pauses  
it's good  
that's definitely an instrument name  
uh so um the means we discussed the smart board and what about uh this digital pen  
it was twelve fifty euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine  
<unk> so  
right and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how <unk> whether you feel comfortable to communicate  
what about um the idea that i had with the cradle  
in the menu  
is the scale linear or is mel scale like in m. f. c. c.  
yeah then we don't have any innovation things  
alright  
when you pick it up it charges up  
the the average should be alright uh to work with  
in the segments file it's really the very basic that have to be displayed for any thing  
you know that kind of spongy yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
there was children's remote  
yeah yeah  
yea yeah  
yeah okay  
for those cold winter days  
so  
um that's what you will need for our first exercise because i'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal  
and we of course have the traditional uh solar power  
you could either um essentially go the same route as they did with the switchboard um you know  
by noise  
yep  
should i clean  
so a relationship between two channel that provide some kind of information  
ratio is different i guess  
yeah that might be a possible  
it's not uh really aimed for all customers  
yeah  
it's working again  
i will take yours  
both  
so what favourite characteristics  
mm-hmm  
right okay  
and anything else you might wanna do and then later on we can put the uh the programme in  
mm-hmm  
and uh that's it  
number one  
see last week by the time everything and and then it'll be hopefully no more than i don't know what twenty minutes today to  
yet on and off is <unk> is perhaps you <unk>  
three  
yeah i think  
okay two  
it doesn't aim so well  
no eight or eight or ten hours of working  
and that it's it's feasible to create and uh  
i'll i'll say two as well  
it's fine it's kid proof  
so you wanna expand the shape of the  
it's a bit of a pity  
yeah but we can say channel twenty five  
mm-hmm  
i mean i sort of wrote the initial draft of it i suppose  
yeah but i'll zap  
yeah <unk> well but uh you don't have to throw uh um important <unk> important aspect like familiarity uh completely away uh because i think it's uh  
um  
no no  
that's friday i think  
ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more  
one problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really but of course  
um not generically  
i guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for  
and that we could load into a prototype and see what types of <unk> what ways of displaying this information are there  
but  
hmm  
it's a gecko  
yeah it's possible some of it  
i am thinking outside the little square box though with literally in like form i don't  
well  
yep  
yeah  
right  
and um you didn't see but the re the real media um is called via a real server  
yeah i think that'd be fine  
it's just fundamentally wrong it's it was meant as a theory for a one person uh right  
'kay  
okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons  
but there's not much we can do about that apart from  
i believe you now it's a good strategy  
yeah but a you don't know  
or a remote control more like joystick  
so if the <unk> t. v. in the next <unk> really loud you can just turn it off  
and uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons  
because i mean the whole i thought the whole thing is that you look at the frequency of a word in that specific how often a word inc occurs in a certain topic versus how often it occurs over the whole corpus and that from that it calculates  
good morning flores  
yeah  
from the technical aspect the processing should be done on the t. v. set than on the on the remote controller right  
just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in <unk> in a software piece  
mm  
yeah  
no it did not work  
i don't think you should say that was the recording  
yeah  
well it it's on the um eraser now so we click the pen button  
so th  
so okay  
or some does it does it gets some <unk> or something  
but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait are you willing to have a bad remote control  
boring as plain as a rectangle  
is that fair though because i think one of the things with these topic models is that you don't know you can't make them cluster  
i can uh have single stream of thirty nine p. l. p. <unk> and then combine them with traps just to have  
no four dollars it's good  
there are the several things  
you are a child of technology aren't you  
yeah  
and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a v.  
i don't know  
so if you give a true to a positive it actually means that the low the lower the better  
ninja homer made in japan  
okay we're final on that  
nice  
um <unk> main internal feature is a circuit board which contains all the <unk> electronics and also the contacts with the power source  
that was good  
i could believe them yeah no taking an interest in that  
okay so number one  
you get quite fine reconstruction of the spectrum at the lower frequencies it which is what you need for reconstruction of the pitch anyway  
yeah  
okay um  
mm  
mm-hmm  
it's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse  
like a raised  
other kind of presentation probably no  
so <unk> do you agree  
yeah  
do you all agree  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
um and the <unk> demographic of the second one  
nobody else than me has a pink remote control  
whereas with phones people charge them once a week  
well in that case it it's probably just i mean that's probably fine  
but for and you could imagine that before sending in the d. v. d.  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
especially for young people  
mm-hmm  
okay  
it's a very simple l. c. d. like whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast  
yes the <unk> there is  
well  
but if a person doesn't like banana or orange you are limiting him  
so you have to uh  
i see some action over there  
now we are looking for  
what do you mean exactly  
and  
yeah or like a gun metal grey 'cause then it combines the silver and the black  
anyway you are not going to be to be above uh alpha times the max of the others right uh because alpha is low lower than one  
mm yeah  
but of course there is there are many problems which we still didn't solve and the biggest one is quite similar to l. p. c. stuff where people still don't know how to exactly encode a carrier or the source signal  
so next slide please  
mm  
i'm not in monday but the other days i'll be around  
um the that i mean that's no because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant  
so  
mm-hmm  
and both family names start with s. t. a.  
yeah  
yes  
yeah  
uh i'll open  
yeah  
don't panic  
yeah but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons  
we split that part in different segments  
uh just done in in note form and i haven't attributed anything to individuals  
we get better evidences than what i we initially had here  
um i shall draw this  
do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand  
so this kind of information might also be helpful  
um yeah  
<unk> <unk> <unk>  
mm  
um i haven't i haven't had any discussions with him since  
so um  
but no i think uh but still then that's what maybe people are going toward sign sort of <unk> no  
that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody  
mm  
that's actually an ionic species isn't it actually  
yeah  
if people like talk like uh  
single curved with articulation  
yeah  
but when you have two of them which might be interesting for separation  
right  
yeah  
that makes different length summaries  
he just put p. make and run it on uh on all the machines here  
shall i go first again  
but uh this is just to get the the <unk> the noise the sound level  
no that's what i don't do  
yeah  
well the last one with the um  
okay  
um we must decide where this meeting  
a particular button which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons  
i will i just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation you wouldn't just have like one set of source  
we include one battery  
yeah i mean it is it's up to it's up to  
the the designers but ninety one percent fifteen to twenty five  
so will you add with the channel keys right  
i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production  
or or or quite purposefully talk about different things so that they've sort of got multi modality of you know  
didn't that come with the l. c.  
where did you put it  
that was our target audience of course  
yeah is is this is from one channel to maybe to ten channel  
mm-hmm  
it's it's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it's can <unk> chinese  
four arrows  
we did yeah  
the down channel the volume do we want that horizontal or vertical  
well you have digital t. v. still already  
hmm  
the market we should have a look at the market  
that's maybe that's better  
as long as you can skip more accurately than the time steps that's fine  
okay  
i don't know  
oh okay  
i'm thinking uh slots of one and a half hour each  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
with <unk> things with links between them documents that are linked  
i'm going to finish my end report  
we should we should try to <unk> try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options  
okay well we <unk> we are very <unk> curious to what the market um will feel about such a product  
yeah <unk> of course  
uh i don't know who propose it i just had it from from <unk> for like a <unk> do you know the guy  
i don't think so no  
but then that's complicated  
that's something to set us apart and uh i was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes  
so you can't directly access a channel but instead use only the up and down arrows  
uh yeah  
repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing  
uh you may not want to work on all the problems  
yeah so um taking that away  
so we could zip we could zip through this and look at all the um all the interactions in which people build sub construct <unk> first which we expect them to do <unk> as a wild hypothesis more when they have verbal communication than when they don't  
you have to pause it and play it for the  
how would that be to best tie in with the system  
you mean like channel and source coding together  
what else does it need  
mm-hmm  
no on the t. v. you don't it doesn't display on the t. v. now  
you have some uh  
and channel  
um the <unk> only gonna be for the television  
yeah  
we raised the price of it we've added two <unk> new technology to it  
<unk> flip it open and you've got all the buttons or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe  
yeah that's our target  
mm  
oh so <unk> you you are think of loading them all at once  
but the colours we don't have special colours on it  
yep  
so maybe next to each of the buttons  
and then just make sure that summary even in the in the most <unk> mode just never puts them in  
yep  
okay cool  
so  
ah that's the second one  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make of course but also the user friendliness so <unk> that's that's some of the main points  
it's a rabbit  
hmm  
i reckon that <unk>  
that's nice  
here's a another example  
uh one single channel or at least a closed channel collection no  
the <unk>  
<unk> through your <unk> list  
no  
that's the brilliance of they had a <unk> they had a peeler in here  
because if we are distributing the microphone all around the table then we come back to the energy solution  
and the  
um this is where kate's expertise comes in and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point  
'cause then in the end i 'cause otherwise we always have two code versions and people might be changing the wrong one  
i don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology  
no it's just different  
five point five average  
th did you make this or the  
you  
yeah  
the screen settings and the channel settings because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on  
um if i'm right there are three presentations i guess each one of you has prepared one  
mm-hmm  
then you have the uh extra keys for teletext mute two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing  
it could go with the granola crowd  
so the  
might be the one kind of like if they have read their mails  
huh  
have you java doc ed it  
okay  
and also uh  
yeah  
just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on  
um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um  
yeah  
one percent well  
and then let them look at those ideas and they say yeah well  
mm-hmm  
does that happen  
you expect that to be the down because it looks like a downward pointing arrow but it's actually the v. to indicate that it's the volume so  
oh so is that mm double way to to show how some way dependent on the task  
now this is still not ideal at the moment dave  
yes  
okay  
well you can point to blue wing flux 'cause you have your line and there's the blue wing flux  
okay  
yeah  
you know is it discussion monologue from the original m. four data collection  
yeah yeah  
they made it very easy for us  
okay  
and then we make it easier uh for our televisions  
mm  
yeah  
so shall we sit together tomorrow then as well  
<unk> uh nee <unk>  
uh  
mm  
that's the question  
yeah  
has it changed  
because it it it took a huge amount of time  
an interesting option  
no that's true  
what form of energy are we going to use  
um to um oh well i'm i wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us  
<unk> making faces at me  
uh <unk> did you uh work out cord  
yeah uh i think it's fine  
yes master  
shoes and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables or getting them or showing some association with them  
so <unk> just the quality of the chip  
tara  
um i think that's it  
because the images are already generated  
<unk> uh we didn't find out any such point  
square  
absolutely prohibitive yeah  
um we decided chip on print would be used  
yeah so from here we go and it hopefully won't be too difficult to now first of all put the right segments in  
okay  
for better want of a better word you know  
it's only if you have an identified peak which is <unk> fifty percent or maybe uh two times higher than the the next second value in the window  
ah we got new idea speech recognition location finding  
and if we get absolutely tons of people wanting to do posters and we don't think there's a you know  
but where do you did you get the newsflash  
um and  
mm yeah  
okay  
this is this is uh good  
yeah  
and you then say this page is based on uh how do you do this  
so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use  
um  
all of the components have been used in other things before  
and if the score comes twenty four thirty five you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five  
no no this is just  
um i dunno i mean we've got a product  
and a and a banana  
sounds good  
ten gigabytes whatever but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons  
we can we'll we'll go and we'll i'm sure we'll up something good for the  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay <unk>  
yeah  
um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard  
suppose they start off with language and then they they say hey look you know let's do it like this  
um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh i was gonna say concrete  
i i think they'll be quite met with their expectations  
well apparently now i write the final report  
but they are more critical  
we like the pens  
yes  
and i'll make us <unk> to read it in  
yeah okay  
that's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so  
so  
yeah  
hmm  
uh yeah you <unk> there's not been more than one study of dwarf amorphous nuclear star burst galaxies  
and all we can do is just process a bit at a time  
count it  
it's a frequency of your vibration here  
but i think we've still decided not to go with that  
they don't like it so we might think about fronts in that section  
oh  
<unk> <unk>  
like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing eye dogs and they're just such friendly animals  
ah  
forty minutes  
or on the l. c. d. we can you know  
exactly  
okay  
now let's do something with martin too  
define  
okay  
um and the buttons will be a <unk> much lighter blue almost see through  
yeah and it depends on if it's sliding but i think it's pretty ergonomic  
yeah  
mm  
okay  
yeah uh materials like wood that  
great  
we need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user friendliness  
yep  
i don't think we should do it  
because basically it's even if they are not real shots they are not so interested if it's not real shot  
same identity  
the decision on the remote control functions  
yeah that's  
generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface but for  
so we might do the sort of open domain  
it's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here  
and click it to <unk> the device  
uh i would say it's the russian trick but anyway no they may have some their origins strange origins  
okay so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing  
mm-hmm  
space remote  
i don't know if it's important for you or not  
uh right  
are are the important aspects of it for this analysis really that substantively different though  
ah  
oh well  
the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash  
and we have a nearly final product  
but then we need to squeeze in in one of the three person rooms some extra visitor space and uh i i think so  
i don't know the phone but i can imagine it  
and that's enough for you right  
when we've got to build um bizarre parts like air craft wings and and things  
mm-hmm  
to tell their opinion  
mm mm  
you can use which which type of television you have  
but then it can we as soon as they replace one of those hard disk i it can it can from the other one it can recover everything on that  
yeah  
they did they had done a lot of questionnaires and they got some user requirements out of that  
we are a couple of people at <unk> and there are already two <unk> two different setups  
if someone's looking to buy a new remote don't they want like an upgrade  
um so let's have a look to the the agenda  
um so is is anybody creating an uh a real raw text thing at the moment like which is just the words  
so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig  
i have four of those remotes  
mm-hmm  
it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem  
now have have we have we decided anything are we doing anything  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape  
instead of  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
oh the mute button  
we've now <unk> we now sort of got an extra form and an extra colour for the buttons  
i think it's 'cause we had to specify it ourselves that it's not as um like focus the specification of most um work we have to do  
yeah  
works with your particular television  
um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before  
um i'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that yeah  
so this is an idea and i i you know this is exactly what the research has uh has shown  
push button scroll wheel we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll  
yeah  
nice  
um right  
i'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um  
uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium  
that's because it was talking about <unk> but if it's saying silicone two line  
i th  
yeah  
so we should maybe we should assume that i <unk> it's just a television that we're wanting to control  
to put yeah to put it in always  
okay  
yeah  
it's triangle two  
yeah so that might be good for example for ten minutes but then the person might move or a different person might come  
mm yeah  
yeah  
so so so as long as they're they're drawn well enough it should be alright  
okay um so um to <unk> to to summarize the teamwork issue saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting  
yeah  
you know yourself  
uh it is different if you want to have other tasks where the only words that all are words  
mm-hmm  
but that's i think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else  
so infra red here  
okay  
<unk>  
hmm  
um i think like what you guys said um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface  
mm-hmm  
this is a new model  
no new requirements say no  
yes especially when there are <unk> a few buttons on it you have uh a lot of space to touch  
one two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen  
uh figures plots et cetera the side one for example it is a result  
so what kind of  
so  
yeah  
we have yeah we have o. c. r. but maybe not on this computer  
he said it was slow  
yeah okay great  
'cause i'm <unk> i'm trying to kinda map this onto <unk>  
mm  
yeah  
it's uh funded by the company  
um i  
yeah  
yeah  
as for the user interface problem you know too many buttons  
cheaper  
'kay so  
yeah an orange  
ah okay yeah yeah  
it needs yeah  
and  
there's basically the fundamental structures but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been  
i mean uh i'm sure if the user pays the same price he's happy to have recognition  
um so now we need to discuss um  
yeah  
yeah anyway  
yeah  
oh it's like the ipod  
exactly  
yeah  
and it helps you to understand  
that's uh  
and uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um  
um  
okay so should i start  
yeah  
and then you can save it immediately  
uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver  
what uh  
so it's  
so would it be higher scored than a word that um occurs  
yeah if there if there uh there is <unk> not enough battery  
or ten times more expensive  
i mean that's  
yes it's more than fifty euros  
the only limitations i see to this is that we're focused on television only  
yeah it <unk> it <unk> been bigger  
um  
a big <unk> button on top or something  
and we all four could range  
everyone is presenting the same set of slide  
<unk> maybe two or three  
i'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an l. like a touch screen type of remote  
alt f. five  
so um  
mm  
but  
uh yeah  
and it has to be <unk> accessible with your uh other hand too of course  
does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control  
i'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it  
but yeah displaying the the current position bar will be easy provided that my whole calculations of like where we are in time here are all correct  
for uh for a simple remote that's a bit oh that's a bit uh  
right if my image is there but after it's there and it looks at how many points <unk> are well matched  
okay yeah yeah  
sixteen  
mm  
yeah  
from one to seven  
those  
okay  
yeah yeah mm  
cool okay  
okay <unk> we now we can just uh  
twenty six  
uh here we have our prototype model  
mm-hmm  
and and then we can plan  
so in that sense it's like like a derived property  
okay so i trained on eighty eight and then or i train on one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine and okay but we should speak to steve  
so so <unk> so i assume that well once you've that sort of information you well you got the g. d. f. format  
hmm  
like if the kinetic thing i think what's best about that is that it's instant energy  
uh ye yeah  
meeting people and bumping into people but it's maybe against the idea if it's a very supposed to be an isolated quiet spot  
yes because we are nice people  
yeah but does it fit with our design  
so uh yeah looking inside a a very simple remote control  
okay  
seventy euros  
i want chrome  
cool  
um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible  
how do we make it look cool is the question  
i would change  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff  
um  
but if <unk> yeah  
alright  
because it's just rubber so it's probably a flat surface rubber  
hmm  
yeah and then like the the covers could be spongy latex <unk> but the actual model could be titanium  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
i mean dave i it's a pretty much <unk> it <unk> should be a question of copying it over it <unk> over right  
right  
now  
yeah  
yeah we do  
okay  
yes  
guido  
what i  
ah  
yeah it could be  
hopefully the person's not turning on and off the t. v.  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i suppose we can do it is it would it be worth splitting it  
it's very different  
is a cradle very cheap  
uh power button  
yeah  
uh this the one number or two numbers button  
sorry  
mm-hmm  
it's just we are half way through the project time table  
well it's not one light it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device  
so  
yeah  
using the  
i think if it's rubber  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
we do have special colour  
oh right okay  
but if we wanna react to it being changed automatically we might have to  
maybe you can send it to me by email  
and you have a <unk> a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own  
i would say no need for a talk back  
this one is curved like this right  
um  
good morning everybody  
with the the board of uh  
well i think that may be so but well we can't just leave the teletext button off  
adapt  
it i it yes it is important for detecting patterns  
groovy  
yeah yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
the scroll plus push  
yeah maybe you can look at dates from uh you know east of uh east uh yeah east anglia  
yeah  
um and uh  
okay nick the cable back then  
wow  
uh-huh  
so at this point we uh let me see discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um  
so okay that's eight  
yeah yeah  
i agree  
it no no  
yeah  
so maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges stuff for strawberries and different colours  
um so  
something like  
yeah  
ah okay  
uh i'm just thinking like it pro it pro probably like the l. s. a. would perform quite well on it  
mm-hmm  
cohesive yeah  
well <unk> uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control  
um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t. v. for example  
okay  
so let's see what's next in the <unk> presentation  
soft plastic or  
specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach  
a jog di  
so that might be the focus of discussions next week or something right that um what need out of this and  
alright  
right  
it's only curve  
how hard is this  
c. o. <unk>  
oh did you not say frequencies <unk> of words in the whole sorry did uh  
that's me done  
okay  
can we get a strong enough battery to power a light  
we own it  
just just switch them  
despite the fact that <unk> only got a value of two euros per unit  
i've put seemed okay  
we'll stay here i guess  
okay  
um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the <unk> production of the components  
that would be enough  
work on that  
there it is  
yeah  
hmm  
what the <unk> oh yeah uh  
channel i think that would be annoying because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel  
and i looked at the design reports from previous years here at real remote  
yeah okay  
you do we do the extra two buttons or not  
um i think uh i know which you understand <unk> uh i know what you mean  
um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple <unk> display uh for the user to to work with  
you're certain that when it stops you've caught the whole speech signal for that utterance and haven't lost any signal information  
mm-hmm  
when you say <unk> when you say double curved what what exactly does that mean  
yeah  
so so uh i <unk> i marked that as a <unk> uh <unk> or <unk> or something to flag anyway  
mm-hmm exactly  
mm  
what do you give it  
good question  
don't know maybe just  
well they  
yeah  
okay  
okay so  
<unk> can be reached by means of  
no  
then you really hear that there is the <unk> in the signal  
right  
actually achieving that in terms of whether the you know the power requirements of the uh such a source  
it was just fixed information and get your stuff from there and i couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff  
um i think our priority really should be unique design  
like <unk> channels  
guys  
yeah  
people don't buy a new remote every so often  
to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me i don't know whether you worked with them before  
yeah yeah sure  
remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons  
some questions are yeah  
that's okay  
i didn't see it yet i think  
so the only thing we're trying to tie in is just an additional annotation which is similar to  
calculator  
and it has to have the slogan case you guys forget the slogan it's we put fashion in electronics  
um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions  
okay  
hmm  
i mean i i actually like the solution however ugly it it looks in terms of a data format of having a track for every possible object of gaze  
yeah  
i think uh the <unk> only options that we have with the case is are these three  
we we wanted and this is relative we wanted <unk> of <unk> of <unk> lines e. g. weak broad lines  
yeah i think that's  
guido  
we'll probably have to implement that  
that's right  
rubber material  
because uh perhaps uh person two will have uh some frequencies in the range of  
no  
see how how long it took them actually  
yeah and i guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product  
alright  
yes  
yep i'm finished  
oh okay so i i mixed those numbers  
yeah yeah  
i think it it was up till the end of october  
but galaxy should be in  
no that's true  
yeah  
which is the case now i think  
control  
it's just to know i mean and if you can have early early warnings in the sense that if you see that there is a major uh problem somewhere  
okay it's the very right one  
yes i  
it you can go into a new menu for that  
of course we need someone who's experienced with the television  
i don't know what do you think uh  
in the shared map map  
saves us money  
so maybe that's for like people are always using p. l. p. <unk> or m. f. c. c. <unk>  
yeah  
but the <unk>  
yeah  
i was here  
okay so first let's go through this <unk>  
yeah uh okay  
minus your <unk> fiasco  
the law isn't very clear  
okay this is this is an open question for you  
an able cluster is just a a discover  
um so yeah so if if we've <unk> if i've c. c. ed the original one then you can tell her that that can be the basis for  
and you're you're number two three four  
yeah  
should be today  
okay we'll say two point four two  
um and <unk> <unk> <unk> interface concept  
uh  
um  
mm no you can't point to it  
that's me  
uh we're kind of in the middle of the market but what i'm seeing is that the market is ready for i i identified new technology  
in the in the latest draft that we had sort of we came up with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance for utterance  
mm-hmm  
right  
but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the t. v. to superimpose those those menus  
it's uh th it it yeah uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons  
do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again  
as far as i know  
it just was in there and i didn't have any information about it but  
yeah yeah sure  
what  
yeah  
takes no ti  
yeah  
it's a question to our technical design our two engineers  
yeah that will be a problem  
what line are we taking out  
easy to press buttons  
yes  
hmm  
yeah  
for the  
if you press select once they become channel changing buttons  
mm-hmm  
<unk> yeah  
would be large enough  
uh dave cochrane  
so <unk> is your direction in horizontal plane  
you always touch it yeah  
m. a.  
right  
okay  
yeah  
yeah no no problem because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth  
ergonomic definitely ergonomic  
i don't  
yeah  
yeah  
and then we now <unk> only have to <unk> to decide the general function uh  
to see sort of what's what's trendy what's new what's happening  
yeah  
but if we do it twice it wouldn't make too much sense  
yeah  
um what i found is that the projected costs are competitive  
we can go to the next slide  
yeah  
so november yeah  
uh yeah scale like uh scale <unk> from uh <unk> uh m. l. p.  
ah <unk> look all the market potential what uh how we should design <unk> our remote controls  
yeah but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together  
you agree  
mm-hmm  
what requirements it has to has to <unk> and you'll all get instructions emailed to you i guess  
it does have an a built in function  
yeah that's it  
and then it only starts at a later time because oh you don't see when i'm pointing at screen it's just for this  
everybody knows uh what to do  
a. <unk> eye might be looking at b. <unk> mouse here right  
and i guess that point about the room not being <unk> very friendly to that i think that's a very big thing  
yes  
i don't know  
we'll open that when the time is right  
<unk> on the front  
yeah but it's only a half  
but we're <unk> running queries in the sense that we <unk> select by by weights don't we  
yeah  
whatever  
we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our modules that create the stuff and and the interface  
but going from from a word business wouldn't it be easier to then go back and calculate for each utterance  
yeah  
yeah this is the front  
<unk>  
speaker and l. e. d. for locating um  
i <unk> i mentioned them already in the previous talk  
it has to be original trendy and user friendly  
i think that's it yeah  
my only concern <unk> uh you a as i said when i barged in was just to make sure that we didn't lose the things that we might need to pick up later  
yeah  
neither am i  
yeah  
yeah  
so one re uh one remote control for all your equipment  
hmm  
it's <unk>  
mm  
welcome to this second meeting  
it yeah  
and you want okay for coming back to one point <unk> you want to let the user to programming the keys  
i mean with things like <unk> with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting <unk> uh brightness and <unk> things that no one really bothers with  
okay well that's good  
okay yeah  
yeah  
every single frame  
that's it's still ye  
okay yeah yeah  
i <unk>  
okay now i uh of course now i understand why they have more uh like um  
thank you  
okay  
ah right  
yeah this could be downloaded by the web maybe or  
okay  
mm-hmm  
temp is no well it's a i think they can they can they can do  
phew  
cherry would be alright actually  
true  
yeah i have to find i have to find out the the commands for like really just redrawing a small small piece  
nobody would take it  
like does it feel good like yeah physically  
yes  
enter any comment you like as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal  
uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be uh yeah um yeah quite a big distance  
v. l. <unk> very long baseline array  
if we want to pay him for some more time we can do that  
okay so one  
yeah  
i've got time now  
mm-hmm  
possible  
no we don't have the colour  
okay  
yeah  
these are these are for colours co and special forms special colours and special materials  
mm-hmm  
i think the voice recognition  
yeah  
with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits  
yeah  
yes we can make also <unk> neon lights on it or or the buttons that can make uh light on it  
oh right okay  
okay  
i've never come across it before but it sounds fantastic  
anyway they're relational  
so i guess what we're looking at here is people want this <unk> technology  
<unk>  
yeah so those are two parts or items you need somehow to encode if you want again to get original speech or reasonable quality  
besides that the technology isn't really super yet so that is a problem in implementing this  
i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for so i'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this  
okay  
yeah  
it's only buttons these  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah the triangles would be best indeed  
okay  
um well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like  
nothing further is  
um okay we still have all all the options  
but but the thing is <unk> when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh <unk> into the remotes  
and you might have a slight thing for to forward and  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yes  
yeah  
oh yeah it could be it  
and that makes uh the the infra red lights signal which is sent to the television set  
yeah pineapple remote remote control  
yeah  
uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
might have to hit function f. eight but it looks like it's gonna come up  
excellent work  
yeah mm mm-hmm  
about uh marketing transfer whatever  
okay  
an yeah  
relatively easy to do  
uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important yeah  
hmm  
um frustrations  
maybe yeah or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay  
yeah and i will i th still think it's gonna be a two or a three  
you know there  
so you ha yeah  
no uh you just number  
well i'm i'm using dice machines  
almost a key ring  
and load it on the the user the server  
so the audio input uh is quite basic no  
you're looking at the technical functions design  
okay  
yeah okay  
it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case and then have the standard rubber buttons as well  
yeah for human resources  
badgers are cool in that one too  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so for that there's  
uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these  
so at least we know that that we've got an absolute limit of about thirty six talks yeah  
uh maybe uh <unk> <unk> <unk> can you give uh uh your presentation uh  
well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something because of the colour  
yeah yeah yeah  
<unk> if that's done in the programme or if that's done off line  
it will be not uh maybe  
i'm going local  
it's  
so back back to this main problem which is yeah  
i mean maybe we want one with a strong signal stream  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
and it's the same thing what happens and a <unk> remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one  
november  
yeah that's a cost <unk>  
so we have uh  
okay  
trend watching  
i thought you were wanting to have two different x. m. l. files with one the reference and one just th just the number  
oh  
mm-hmm  
i see  
when you saw th li uh earlier when we selected it <unk> i couldn't erase anything  
from a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing it's a shake it it doesn't work shake it knock it or something  
that th that's true  
so just for a television is that all we need  
recognition  
mm-hmm  
otherwise you do  
mm-hmm  
no a as you saw on on this drawing just open open this one or that one  
i was thinking very black and white  
not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing but  
almost okay  
how the this remote  
alright  
but  
not quite yet through  
it annotated meeting data  
it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have  
there's no l. c. d. control so if we're thinking about the rest of the market it's sort of probably halfway  
good morning  
start your minutes  
the cost  
no you can use the  
nothing important and <unk> nothing big enough they're gonna look at it right  
marketing um <unk> kendra with the uh um designing the the the user interface uh uh and kate with the the industrial design  
u. v. and optical <unk> u. v. and optical emission should be in there though  
then it may be good to compare these features and but if you <unk> use some uh large vocabulary system  
she i think she meant to use the infinitive but she just left off the to  
good good good  
so um  
i think there's a little there's a little um chi  
so next meeting you guys have to prepare the <unk> things  
i mean it's uh  
and then it also has digit  
of course they are  
mm 'kay  
the yeah  
you don't have to look down to find them  
but i think this <unk> approach can do that because you really can split it into several bands  
i don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though  
i. d. yeah  
it's gonna be after the data manager's made  
just hitting the half an hour mark  
hmm  
yeah  
mm  
yeah yeah  
so we cannot work on more than one page at same time  
you can press the the menu button and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display  
because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates  
uh blank  
so that'll probably keep me from pointing on my screen which i usually it might just be at this point  
'cause i'm just doing a <unk> yeah disk check or something  
uh  
so yeah i'd say  
and i closed your slide show  
but not the the the the <unk> uh squares i think uh  
yeah i think so  
yeah  
yeah  
it's it's a bit like a banana  
that's the day you wanna use the t. v.  
uh what about a  
mm-hmm  
top or bottom  
to be honest i was  
okay  
uh speech recognition  
is the yellow  
doesn't have to go through a wall because you're not gonna be looking through a wall  
um when you multiply them you get the these three points  
it's just a web link  
so i think it's a good aspect and it should be kept  
mm  
yeah  
yeah but it's not really related to the ah yeah i see it's uh you need a bit both uh  
oh you didn't get anything  
oh it's all here  
yeah it's  
mm  
yeah  
so according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job  
um then things started move a bit  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
and they're <unk> therefore looking at two objects at once  
okay  
mm  
no that it would turn out to be a pretty straight forward remote control  
mm-hmm  
visually presents  
audio settings channel settings and maybe there are options for the remote itself  
oh but what pain that's gonna be analytically  
okay  
then you can also wait  
yeah so it's just like the same products but just put together in a different way  
oh  
um  
i would give it a more a five or a six  
i said that weak line was  
but if we have uh a me yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
well thank you  
mm-hmm  
so i think we have to kind of get an overview of what the candidates are <unk> if there's like two or three that we think are good contenders  
yeah  
and then you have the other thing that seventy five percent zap a lot but that's not a <unk> question with the l. c. d. screen  
perhaps the options should be uh  
oh really you've seen one before  
mm-hmm  
coffee  
yeah 'cause with voice recognition  
yeah  
oh i don't think so  
but it  
interestingly enough  
you do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well  
um and then it <unk> that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent <unk> sort of use of interface in remotes  
mm-hmm  
yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay  
um i have  
and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available  
yeah  
okay  
explanation  
yeah i think we're targeting everyone so remote  
and we're using this our basic chip set so it's all good  
okay  
so be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them because they might be kind of two um  
the firm supplies a simple a regular and an advanced um circuit board  
mm  
okay  
we could think about it and come back to it next meeting  
so you need to know the percentage of time it was on during that fixation  
mm  
well usually hold 'kay we want it to be good also for the left hand users right  
so you have to again download from uh their web page  
we have the master p. c. which take <unk> uh which takes care about the audio  
well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros  
you don't have to you know you can shake it a few times or whatever  
not quite  
oh no  
yeah  
but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on  
um persons were asked  
i think we have to choose yeah  
that's nine nine characters over okay  
yeah of course  
but it can be yellow as well  
so it's not overly i mean i don't know what <unk> most of the buttons do on my remote controls  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
there's some people who are doing p. h. d. <unk> or master students who won't necessarily be there for a larger extent of time  
you want to flaunt  
yeah  
yeah that i think that's as much as we need to say  
or you and he can uh we can try to use uh france telecom's uh approach actually  
something that's stylish so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying  
and um so we will have here video  
so the better now for special navigation  
i think a five  
yeah  
and that's the end of this meeting  
and sample sensor  
no problem  
my d. machine  
but but but that all relies on finding some way of getting the speech tools to do their job  
so that's the way it works at the moment  
come along with it in the next meeting we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate  
yeah  
i was gonna say put it in  
it can be useful for them and the new users as uh our marketing expert was saying  
vibrate  
yes that's important  
okay so it's it it does it <unk> itself you don't have to set it okay  
i think with the mobiles  
uh let's say two  
like you just grab it you don't have to <unk> look at it you know which way around to point it  
just to t. v. okay  
and if <unk> between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting  
yeah  
looks like more fruit  
no  
yeah  
my m. l. p. <unk> are trained on everything and uh test set is digits yeah  
yeah that's okay that's true  
uh the case would be doubly curved  
it has uh very little buttons and but it it uh it's it's quite um yeah you can easily <unk> the buttons  
couple of minutes  
maybe i think uh uh i industrial <unk> uh it's the function design  
yeah  
under documents in the shared folder  
so you've got say maybe a v. c. r. and a t. v. which are separate  
mm-hmm  
um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it  
and i think your leadership was quite good  
you have one with a flag and one with a banana and one that's a spongy  
um  
yeah this  
'kay so shall we quickly  
one one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other  
welcome at the kick off meeting  
so you collect on monday  
all these s. and r. <unk> p. l. p. <unk>  
are we going <unk> uh with the front uh fronts uh idea  
i agree actually  
but  
right  
yeah but we have we also we have to get to the money  
if you if there's <unk> i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance you might be <unk> inclined towards it  
it totally meets with that requirement and seven is no it really doesn't we need to go back and start again  
yeah and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different  
no just before my p. h. d.  
<unk> how is the remote going to look  
mm  
<unk>  
and um  
you are out of course  
if you do that  
profitable  
google and  
i'm writing so only me can read  
run the okay  
what  
yeah  
six  
that's right again  
wouldn't it be easiest to just incorporate a new attribute in in this file  
a two for fashion  
uh if you <unk> if you press a button you can see it <unk> i'm not sure <unk> i'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like  
mm  
um and they weren't entirely clear  
i really  
so something that's uh  
<unk>  
and how  
so i'd just be building the data structure again  
no you're probably right  
fantastic  
well i don't know about i know about this for the <unk> i haven't done this with uh transcription yet  
no no no no  
mm-hmm  
group features for a higher <unk> uh what i was claiming in the previous meeting  
you can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears  
the uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions  
yeah  
or something something between that  
so you know  
so maybe like we had to do this end point detection and probably a little bit of final filtering  
old people and uh  
i think it should be there working design  
a two  
yeah so we have to bake the <unk> back flat and then  
yeah  
again i don't think that's ever been done before  
uh it's not so far from lisbon half an hour mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
push  
so people will be able to see uh and so that the <unk> you know example movements uh and things like that will be  
first layer obviously <unk> yeah <unk> it's it's like silly but the people will really appreciate it yeah i think  
great  
mm  
the paper i pointed you to a few weeks ago or last week  
and steve <unk> and his i've forgotten the name is it was it simon his yeah  
it's like three four  
but maybe there's some function with no it isn't  
but in  
um  
in the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're <unk> all just gained access to  
yeah  
no  
okay  
um and relevance of one point five  
yeah numbers it might be okay because most of the sentences might be three seconds or something  
adding something or changing the existing argument in some way by relating a contribution to what's um already on the table  
i think maybe they were  
and and uh <unk> you were when you're using uh windows you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons uh which you can use for drawing  
what is this  
i i think that i think that between philosophy informatics and um psychology you've probably got quite a lot of breadth there anyway  
some finger grips maybe  
uh you could make like a hole in it you know of uh in in the  
yeah  
so we're really probably in terms of marketing are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product  
yeah  
yeah  
making emission feature which we're including now  
but before we going to celebrate uh i have uh a little question which you can't answer because uh there must be some kind of end report  
there we go there we go  
yeah  
yeah that's right  
computer  
so we we'll put some extras if there is something  
yeah and then on top of that  
okay  
excellent  
could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one  
and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu  
no but then it's it's like this uh  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
no  
yeah and then  
yeah  
i mean does  
yeah  
well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again  
so oh but then a <unk> research group could take an image  
but i'm not sure if anything's happened since then  
yeah  
so that's  
right  
okay  
ah yeah  
banana shape  
hmm  
then okay to confirm and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level  
now i <unk> uh oh i know i know  
anything else  
yeah  
the industrial designer  
on the side this one  
okay  
okay  
it's pretty fancy  
yeah i don't know what this means  
or maybe traps  
shot begin and end  
but if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi purpose that's a  
and then yes  
okay  
mm  
would we wanna ask them and put some kind of like <unk> in to make it um specific to sort of preemptively  
yeah  
yeah  
well <unk> <unk> look at the licence conditions it might not  
okay  
okay  
okay um  
yeah but but then it does okay  
perhaps we should use the teletext sign in <unk> yeah  
'kay  
uh actually sorry i have to see the other sorry  
mm-hmm  
they basically don't really care of this aspect as far as i understand mm  
yeah looking yeah fruit  
we <unk> we started off a little little weak  
um the video button should be uh an apart button because you want it to uh <unk> yeah to use it fast within one uh click  
so the all in one idea goes out the window  
and we move more to to working together as team because at first you you make your individual contribution  
okay  
um  
okay um let's do this fast  
that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button  
yeah  
yeah  
alright  
yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded it would be a good thing right  
um  
i don't know what the right order is  
<unk> you saw it in my marketing report they like the new fancy stuff so  
okay  
mm  
hmm  
'cause if what we're looking for is the um frequency statistics i don't see how that would be changed by the classification  
you <unk> you send the things to them they will see if they can recover  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
and you can uh do di two sites  
okay  
silence  
it's awful  
and then that will be i think that's everything we need <unk> before we can before you can start running the experiments isn't it  
we could probably go back to the <unk> um to the group directory and just use this trick  
okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group  
i mean i know the <unk> and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing  
yeah i'm just thinking if we i we wanna make something different right  
okay  
so breaks my heart  
fair enough  
so it works like a mobile phone flipping but <unk> you know as long as that side's flat than that will work  
i have uh have to it has to fit my hands  
uh for this is theta one theta two theta three  
yes because we don't want it underlined  
you know like what is the uh  
so you can see it on our site  
slash video browser  
it's very it's very work relevant 'cause people send spam a lot  
and then again i think  
if we have a menu uh how do we uh choose other options  
yes i mean well yes <unk> who are we going to uh to well to sell this the customers indeed yes  
so let's see  
it doesn't  
yeah  
an okay button around here so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily  
but definitely it's better than co coded speech no  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
what is f. p. g. a.  
no i mean yeah they're they're uh you're gonna find that for any speaker they have a set way of of <unk> these things  
oh he is the artistic design  
just has  
with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had with the way that was more like that  
no  
alright  
yeah that's why i wanted to to include the speech recognition because you wanted all the new things  
yeah  
um and it was considered a one point five relevance on a scale of ten  
i think people would find that too foreign  
um from twelve fifty if we <unk> wanna get our <unk> uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five  
okay yeah afterwards yeah okay  
yeah  
both  
yeah  
yeah yeah because in the beginning what they say that send us the thing we'll look at the things  
uh uh <unk> are you sure  
oh  
that doesn't matter  
to our p. c. <unk>  
everything that's in there is in category one  
uh but anyway it seemed to me pretty good  
but if you <unk> if it's say four repeated um if the word is repeated four times uh then that's not too hard to count  
hmm  
does that make sense huh  
excellent  
and you think that we will be  
so whether it's triangle or whatever else  
and for the buttons um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in <unk> for com p. c. <unk>  
oh  
okay  
well i can give you the frequency what people what options people use most often  
for creation  
or we could say it  
mm-hmm  
or a very general word  
okay  
i i think you just have to push it in really hard  
with with grey or black  
yeah so but we don't know like we thought like i thought it's recovering so maybe by tomorrow i'll get everything so  
but we should place the screen on top right  
okay  
yeah  
so at the moment you you just you measuring the f. zeros relative to the average for the speaker or  
yeah okay  
yeah  
yeah it's okay  
yeah you <unk> that's a fun that's not the function of the controller that's a function of t. v.  
and um the means  
they also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style  
um  
hmm  
yeah  
well th there's the people who desire speech recognition there's the different <unk> demographics have different desires i don't know if you guys <unk>  
two  
'kay  
where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside  
yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay  
no  
that's a good idea  
okay yeah  
i doubt it  
mm-hmm  
and that's the only way i remember that i need to go other that point  
mouth  
and well i can again play it and it works on two kilo bits per second  
uh hmm  
that's this bit right here  
you're all fine  
okay  
yeah definitely  
do you have all your answers  
is that guaranteed to stay the  
mm  
oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it  
otherwise it  
<unk> mm  
uh i'm not quite sure i have only seen that the uh the individual words have got an i. d.  
okay so so they give you only the training or development data only  
yeah right  
but you should make sure that you have every button they need on it  
<unk>  
we can't  
cat  
maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't  
i'm uh when i said it i remember i had it here  
yeah but suppose you have a family watching t. v.  
as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market not only in terms of providing quality products  
mm-hmm  
but you prefer kinetic  
uh  
it's gonna roll away  
the  
and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward which <unk> you have to select pen format  
if we remove the l. c. display we could save ourselves  
but when do we need <unk> by  
it can allow  
keeping lines there  
yeah <unk> you can lose it but it isn't hard to lose  
yeah and then maybe have some basic information  
that it doesn't die but it i it carries  
that one side was supposed to be rounder so we said the back side round yeah  
so it's advanced integrated circuits  
yeah  
yeah  
true or false and then on a scale of seven points a scale as we all know it  
five minutes  
i think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though  
okay  
mm 'kay  
very  
<unk> <unk> it's uh  
okay everybody is ready  
yeah i don't really think that's gonna work but  
yeah  
yes  
no i think it's after after five minutes or something a timer i i think no  
alerts the text display  
mm  
no  
so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side the double r.  
yeah  
i <unk> i did see <unk> i've been looking at some guidelines for another corpus and i did see something about proper names  
and then what did we say just now  
but i saw the algorithm i have been using even that called temporal decomposition i don't know if you <unk> you know that like  
yeah  
yeah  
so basically we're moving into a new space but it's  
they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question you program the answer and the machine responds accordingly  
three alright  
true but we did we didn't get that  
the buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching t. v. in the dark or whatever  
yeah  
um i guess you could better <unk> you should look at a a user <unk> uh approach  
yeah you you didn't draw the docking station  
see if i can find them  
okay  
advanced version we have speak  
any anything nonsense or else it beeped  
well uh my name's and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote  
line blanketing  
we have to get the hub stuff through but um you know he's <unk> not ready with an annotation scheme that can be used at the moment anyway  
that switching was easy  
so if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re tune it  
and and the the holes in your head everything the the nose and so on  
it could be one button for a menu or something if you really need to go and do that  
yeah no mm  
so adding channel information on the image at the same time in order to save sound bits  
yeah and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is  
okay  
i'm sorry <unk> where do you wanna hit the t. you wanna we want a button on the television  
you know a long time  
yeah we could use another form or shape or colour that kind of things  
yeah  
yeah  
but it's a mono but it's a mono uh microphone  
duh  
i'm just gonna pass this along  
oh this is  
model <unk> builder that's what i was calling the graphical model editor right  
can't th can't they get legal aid  
<unk> okay  
it could work but  
i have a lot of new information  
hmm  
'cause only one of the uh <unk> videos will actually have the soundtrack  
mm  
uh yeah i think it would be good dave's right  
um yeah easy  
so you have yeah  
hmm  
totally  
okay  
okay okay okay  
so you need to follow all those  
he's done it okay  
i mean i think the informatics are definitely worth asking  
mm-hmm  
um sorry i'm just seeing this with the t. v. there is t. underscore v. underscore  
yeah  
but that's that's only for the buttons  
um like you said time to market was a problem um and how many components are physically in there in cost  
so do we take these off  
right  
it <unk> does look like the curvy and then the whole <unk> curvy so i would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable  
and the only thing you <unk> don't you <unk> don't know would be the <unk> to uh to a category  
and produce less of the silly colours maybe  
but uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise  
it should be it should be longer because it's not a product name that you <unk> print on a box  
mm  
pineapple bee  
okay  
oh right yeah okay  
i'm gonna take the microphones 'cause it's too lazy <unk> take them off again  
alright yeah  
i yeah pretty compulsively during meetings like yeah  
no not certainly <unk> not looking at codes no  
not nice shape i mean they're all the same and they're not <unk> good looking  
yeah  
and you can <unk> uh classify  
yeah  
remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly  
so that's the important point here so these are the different options that we have  
and um somebody makes a statement they have an intention about how to modify that group argument  
yeah  
mm  
that basically means our browser really is a viewer mostly  
um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful  
or actually the other way around  
manual yeah  
sure  
you can disconnect it there no  
yes  
is that right  
i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command  
alright  
on the other hand if you don't do it we can also make a nice bay  
all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables  
and the remaining a appear so little that in the case cannot really improve that much  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah that's right  
yeah  
five  
we'll reach the uh reach that profit  
at the moment they're in different colours  
hmm  
i i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's <unk> it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper  
oh no  
and um i think she's just forgotten  
but my in my opinion the the easy to use r. c. is uh the best uh <unk> possibility for us  
and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay  
the order  
oh they're both <unk>  
it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time  
and  
so it's just a <unk> of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
i mean trendy is what people want so then i <unk> they will buy our product  
yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the t. v. to receive  
for practical reasons  
she would have highlighted the whole thing  
yeah we won't add that functionality  
don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough  
yeah  
but i'll try and get a good address to send it to  
maybe you can look how how much it is for the l. c. d.  
gonna say four  
it's in terms of how much all of the people involved in the meeting um take some take equal part in it as opposed to um like the highest state is people in the meeting just driving it and and uh the other people following whatever the high state is people want  
and then you can and then you can add to the colours  
uh also for the cost uh use only plastic  
so i think dave really the easiest way is if you just make a sound card and a non sound card version of it  
yeah  
easy to <unk> uh to  
yeah then we can conclude that  
yeah  
now the  
it's very complex  
yeah  
since we're doing uh touch screen  
and if you press the menu button you get into the menu and you can use the same buttons  
yeah  
would the the idea something along the lines of one on button would turn on say the video recorder  
with a strawberry on top  
classically what you do is you extract the signal of the person  
because recently uh i saw news item on t. v. um about  
yeah it's kinda cool  
yes okay  
right  
um so i think if we have those features it's you know  
okay  
or it would be maybe feasible  
yeah  
the okay  
is that <unk>  
i have never done anything  
so yeah you will have so one button and <unk>  
so if there's something <unk> and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um  
i i  
and then  
yeah  
and if we do in fact i don't know yeah it's <unk> <unk> view page source okay view frame source  
<unk> <unk> <unk> more than thirty minutes  
but but i but in the sense that as you saw with um the windows logo badge it doesn't really matter  
i guessing from what you're saying you want all these tracks  
and then <unk> yeah and then we could have it  
um well um  
and we just yeah go from there  
mm  
you know how you turn that one to a zero wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things so you need both of them  
okay  
okay  
but you just  
yeah  
some kind of <unk> sensor information  
okay  
'kay leadership what do we report back to the bosses  
yeah p. l. p. <unk>  
but we include <unk> of source types we would mark  
it's fine  
another one  
no of course  
because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups different um functions of it  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um well actually i didn't go didn't feel like it  
we can go to  
you you we have an advanced chip on print and we have an l. c. display  
that's true  
and then the result of that is a construct  
oh  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah  
well what we had function that what people do so  
no it's quite clear  
some non functional tasks  
participant four  
and maybe there was a long blow by <unk> and you don't you kind of wanna abstract away from he said this  
mm  
um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout which makes it confusing  
the problem is really up to you guys whether you think it's good to have one person  
<unk>  
okay then you you will provide a file with all the <unk> from the old ones to the  
it's not the data format i'm worried about  
yes  
the options and then you have something like uh the p. over here  
um  
well one area or whatever not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um  
okay  
i'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do  
sebastian is thinking about the animal  
yeah  
yeah save it and start a new blank document  
yeah  
no  
um and then the sender and infra red um has been used quite successfully  
nice  
right the remote is not ugly a bit weird sentence but  
<unk> nobody use it for recognition stuff i think i never heard that  
it was fun  
okay  
we have to i think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside so of course  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that  
let's have rubber push buttons hey  
right  
looks strange  
so  
um  
and if what happened  
yep  
p. l. p. <unk>  
uh actually i think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people <unk> fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote  
i don't know it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me like  
yeah i've nothing to <unk>  
things like that depending on which country you are  
so  
and then do topic segmentation again to see if the boundary actually coincide with each other  
possibly i'm think i'm not sure but i'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used  
because you can decide what compression factor and everything  
uh i don't know  
uh it starts the uh on we this wednesday and goes through to next wednesday  
yeah  
so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented  
i don't know if it needs to be four credit or not  
yeah  
so uh entirely sure  
can we be more flexible with our hours if we wanna sort of i mean depending on who's using the computers  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
the first one is the speech <unk> again it's detachable or add on  
oh if it's just up and down  
so off you go and design stuff <unk>  
love um  
no  
mm  
which are just two of these things  
we'd want to rate them as how important they were wouldn't we  
yeah  
uh so basically a distribution generated by this guy is basically a point on this simplex  
that's not a new statement at general  
i think that's a good idea to go for  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i think for sure  
what  
but  
hmm  
um  
yeah two or three  
maybe hold it  
we have two scroll wheels  
well  
you know what i mean minimum phase signal  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
uh no i <unk> i i agree i mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um  
but we <unk> yeah it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product um which we'll be talking about later i think  
mm-hmm  
so the components that we find here are the energy source you know the battery or whatever that's gonna <unk> make it work then the chip  
no  
uh especially we looked at the form material and the colour  
<unk> uh fancy coloured remote control  
let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface  
yeah yeah yeah  
there was that <unk> <unk> <unk> pro <unk> <unk>  
you <unk> you can <unk> make them very fancy by um  
mm-hmm  
alright  
yeah  
okay bye  
yeah  
go away  
which is not necessarily a battery as we're about to see  
i think so  
both yeah  
yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control  
oh yeah  
mm-hmm  
i have a little <unk> uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
it goes down from there seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five  
yeah  
where's the best best place to put it  
i don't know the english word so forget it  
final prototype right  
uh i think just a <unk> and the navigation is very basic it's usually the same thing  
yeah it wouldn't  
of course if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off  
i don't know  
yeah  
thanks  
for the menu  
okay that's the side  
where you from in san diego  
mm-hmm  
looks like it  
i would prefer round  
so we have the project team which is to um basically to come up with a new <unk> remote control device  
it's kind <unk> it probably  
um i think in a practical way we kind of know what it is  
that <unk> <unk> yeah for the retrieval function  
we also have a apple slash cherry design at the top  
you <unk> two  
well okay  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
so  
then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all <unk> can visualize  
exactly  
but um  
the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area  
yes  
i think we got it already  
and that would <unk> also give it kinda durability and  
yeah  
it the it might be perceived as tacky glow in the dark  
okay well  
uh no not even that  
um  
so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing people do not like that um the repetitive use i guess caused a strain  
okay  
<unk> uh yeah maybe it's better if the uh scroll wheels are um more separate yeah  
two yeah  
i've made a <unk> few assumptions here in that i'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four euros  
yeah okay  
uh also with the th thinking maybe turning this uh work into publication the one about the for sure  
interface  
a little bit but yeah  
your <unk> just  
yo  
yeah  
is that alright  
okay  
yeah here  
yeah  
are a bit uh well <unk> what i didn't actually <unk> it was that the uh this is for a specific television  
marketing director says yeah  
mm yeah  
i mean solar is of course it's nice but it's well your uh your calculator has a solar panel  
because if it's <unk> too small we can we can lose it at home you know  
sure sure  
so yeah  
uh these are number frequencies  
alright so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons was that right  
yeah  
it's it's it's wisdom  
so  
that's ridiculous  
do you mind looking  
um did we have a lot of room for creativity  
okay  
yeah yeah  
of course  
okay  
two  
'kay  
what  
right  
god i still don't know what i'm gonna write about  
but uh the and  
there's always the problem again then the people who are presenting the posters don't get around to go and look at others' posters  
so it also looks nice when it's on your table  
mm-hmm  
mm  
this is the remote control tomato  
no no  
i dunno  
okay  
we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half euros so  
slanted yeah  
uh it shows a number of developments  
yeah  
you know it's not very uh strong uh wood  
i wouldn't but because it's a <unk> of data  
it's like  
it's this uh problem i hear every time on the speech meeting how do we detect speech and not speech  
yeah  
so you need to get their email addresses  
i'm not so happy about the fruit shape you know  
so  
yeah that's what i was thinking  
thanks  
a television don't have to be on that one you can press on yeah stand by  
yours is well  
yeah and keeping the l. c. d. screen out  
yeah  
to use  
hmm  
and you control those accounts  
you you have to understand there's things about this project we've hidden from you so far that you'll have to learn about  
yeah you can <unk> in what material would that be in uh  
yeah that's gonna be the trick  
um if we are if we were to follow that avenue  
it should fit in those settings functions  
i have experience with that  
um  
so that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are <unk> li light up  
<unk> okay  
is that because the of the discrete volume levels or is that  
yeah  
ah  
so  
yeah  
<unk> yeah  
hmm  
yeah thank you thank you very much  
and then uh hit that little folder up thing again  
uh-huh  
then press uh al  
yeah  
true or false easy to use  
yeah  
yeah but they think it's really important  
that's true yeah  
okay the second one  
you can go into you in you main menu you can choose uh flip channel uh you can choose sound options any options  
or is it no it's synchronized  
i mean you have to <unk> you have to break one to get one okay  
hmm  
yeah then then do i think  
you guys you guys can uh create a  
or  
yeah  
uh we have one  
yeah  
we're not even sure what what information we want to display on it  
mm-hmm  
product  
the thing flew in you didn't have the whole <unk> thing 'cause there wasn't time for that so yeah  
just escape i think  
okay  
erase  
alright  
project documents i think  
um well i am going to put it in here uh because we can uh look  
everything  
mm-hmm  
right  
expert map  
they propose us like celebration everything we could forecast it right  
in the same set yeah and and individual buttons to make them work  
oh no  
um so larger  
what  
see you in thirty minutes  
perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile  
okay um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra red thing  
i drew a kitty  
yeah  
in map  
i think it is  
and uh so what else was there  
we can sell our <unk> remotes to  
oh i i have that file  
because we are all uh full of work  
the bosses will be very pleased  
mm-hmm  
so we've what have we what have we rid of  
we use a uh sensor that's for the speech  
alright  
i think we <unk> if we keep on adding things so we have to  
mm  
right okay  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
let's do a single curve  
yeah  
it has  
forgot  
'cause that'd be pretty good  
cool  
but it's into the rubber  
we  
yeah  
so this would be basically be a a sequence right  
so i think the joel will be is is my main hope that he's uh he's going to pick up uh the key word spotting and some of these ideas and also the reason why <unk> uh i <unk> uh uh petr <unk> is here is that joel is also getting interested in uh opal models of uh <unk> temporal envelope  
it's it's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics  
the the stanford web base data set that i was using for this for for a bit of this um  
even if it's difficult to use prefer it to have the newest features  
but the mass of the words actually you use are words that are common  
yeah and then he's doing quite a fast transition from these to another one  
but isn't that expensive in the entire package  
um i would say that you're at least gonna take double curved and even then i'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation  
um  
and um it's within budget yep  
yeah  
uh what the  
well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps  
whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it  
then  
so if if you'd be watching a movie it would constantly beep  
mm  
'kay and you want to write up on there it says you've gotta sum up your <unk> <unk> your favourite characteristics of that animal  
uh <unk> okay  
yeah  
maybe you won't like my answer but i would say that um we <unk> we we start but we <unk> we really have to start on working <unk> uh reading all the code from darren  
mm  
so maybe we should we should think in in this direction so  
six five four  
can be used by both kids and old people  
so  
what the user wants yes  
or  
because if people are able to change the covers i don't know maybe the on off button  
stick it on the t. v.  
it's another problem  
yeah  
it's very very quick to access the main features  
yeah  
yeah  
uh pro probably actually not even the sound effects 'cause otherwise they'll expect that in the real experiment and that doesn't happen  
<unk>  
yeah  
so it's i mean it's easy enough to do just che just checking the times th times of the events  
and standard battery okay a chip imprint there's no specific problem  
yeah that's meant with <unk> uh with <unk> curve  
mm-hmm  
but there's another problem  
so for him it's the same thing  
um one's based on the banana one's based on the tomato and the other one is <unk>  
twenty <unk> minimum is no no de because of uh  
okay  
well i the fact of the shape memory alloys is that they they don't need to be manually de um <unk>  
so maybe we <unk> <unk> will be able to clarify this this question to today  
mm-hmm  
and the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode and there is not a power source here  
yeah you're right  
like modified banana okay  
thanks  
but yeah it's it's <unk> strange  
okay  
mm-hmm  
but that you can do with location if it's only on the short term  
it can be costly  
let's go on then  
original  
what are you guys doing now  
um  
okay  
yeah like with those watches that you kind of twist  
the texts on the things they're linked to so what i wanted to know was can you combine the topic models that the pages  
the agenda for the meeting i put it in the <unk> shared documents folder  
mm-hmm  
right now i'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of chris <unk> local michigan folk singer really lame and uh  
mm-hmm yeah voice  
mm-hmm  
he's behind hand  
and um that means we do need to  
added extras  
yes okay  
yeah no but dave um yeah so <unk> that's what i was thinking that like the second meeting should continue till the first one's stopped  
yeah  
so we've done the  
so  
easy  
it's just either there's two or three people in those rooms and sometimes there's less sometimes there's more because we also don't work fixed hours  
you say june two thousand six we know it is june two thousand six  
mm-hmm  
what we're stuck with  
i <unk>  
maybe we could  
so the more pages you get the better your results  
five  
no no when i i my personal taste is that i want it to fall over my hands with a thick but  
the most professional way of doing it would be to map them according to the standard deviation 'cause that way it au would automatically always that's sort of like it it's the problem is it's more calculation expensive and slightly more complicated even though it's actually like in terms of calculation it's not much heavier  
industrial designer to tell what he did  
we've got the functional design conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um  
i should start  
uh of course <unk> uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it  
use of the rubber the use of the l. e. d.  
so we do one more step here and we uh here by means of another h. m. m. we introduce some kind of uh prior knowledge and <unk> information  
so you have more sky which is black on the right so you don't care about this  
yes  
okay so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh  
the screen location of absolute <unk>  
yeah  
it just needs to know whether it's displaying more than one whole meeting doesn't it  
yeah  
well you say video name equal all are on the same level  
then at least you can see  
and there's something on it  
i mean fire wire was a project  
twenty to like fifty five  
how would you point it  
we'll use that later  
when we did uh <unk> fashions uh recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that  
yeah we have to take care of the twelve euros  
two examples  
ah okay  
ronald <unk>  
okay we <unk> skip the l. c. d. display  
yeah  
so there goes  
but ma  
it doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh  
so just go through it in the components  
yeah  
so the the cost is actually a bit more it's uh it's it's sixteen francs  
and that's basically it that's the potato  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i'll i'll bring it okay so it's it's done  
some time yes but not so many days or  
mm  
and  
yeah  
i uh  
and i'm marketing  
alright  
which makes sense  
okay  
something a bit more flush yeah or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well  
okay  
no  
but yeah still some people are in vacation so they will really  
hmm  
um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it  
so  
that's right  
and you tried it  
yeah of course  
this is just guessing  
well we come back to the drawing board then huh  
so i will first uh  
okay  
yeah  
so you cannot get anything new out of that after some time  
a card a video card which is call um i. v. c. mm yeah  
yeah that's uh a problem  
but  
yeah  
and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it  
hmm  
but um know sort of the the organic  
yeah that will <unk> means it'll light up that's it  
then it's <unk> it it's not really open domain and somehow that sneaks into all the statistics anyway 'cause you don't have such a wide vocabulary and you know  
re well you can understand  
bright but too not yeah  
what the fuck is this  
mm mm-hmm  
i think you're probably right in the case of it being data  
i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that  
uh uh  
anyway let's see what you have  
mm-hmm  
you have to paint now  
yeah i agree  
little different  
<unk> you can't release this data for four months  
yeah  
and i've got a sentence length incorporated into my importance measure at the moment  
at the moment it's ready to like get dialogue acts out with  
and uh the menu structure uh if necessary with your other hand so it's just gonna hold it easily  
are you here  
yeah  
yep  
so that's easy enough  
so  
okay  
so if it if it's not working i guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing  
okay  
i mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead  
yes  
so  
okay  
talking of which maybe a <unk> function is not not too bad  
production  
so is there anything else  
big round body really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face  
an animal  
okay project <unk> uh well we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet  
and then <unk> identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh <unk> project plan that we have so far  
so we're just estimating that yeah it would be less  
so we have three people saying it should be on top  
and i don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions more buttons maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that  
yeah okay  
<unk>  
i suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser  
oh  
hmm  
and if you want for example this little work uh about seeing when the slide channel is background and foreground is not beginning of this kind of thing  
okay  
that  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
and so we <unk> <unk> everybody have that  
and the kinetic energy shaker style <unk> <unk> ooh no  
ah ha  
okay maybe  
it's more familiar that way  
uh then uh sammy will propose some uh <unk> <unk> criteria to evaluate this prototype  
well it's <unk> true  
could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen  
the single function  
we we we we we yeah it's the way they are going to be actually  
yeah  
but uh  
uh  
yeah  
okay  
<unk>  
yeah  
well not all  
yeah but yeah  
mm  
okay  
um  
but i haven't figured out how it works and that's something that probably so if everyone is ever bored or anyone feels that they can do that  
oh  
you think it's possible  
i mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand  
so we've  
is there a big <unk> community that ranks these things  
well it's not the yeah  
yeah  
even if they give you p. files it's really better even you don't really need to <unk> run all the  
um so that's where that's stored  
is like  
that's  
yeah  
something like that  
well yeah  
click  
even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it it looks still looks boring so  
functions  
well there we go  
maybe uh i i think i think something like that  
but i'll uh make sure that uh happens next time  
leadership was uh crappy  
mm-hmm  
no  
no  
yeah  
no raid five is better i think  
yeah i think so  
and then passes that signal on to the infra red l. e. d. and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo transistor  
materials  
real reactions  
but don't erase my cat  
good  
so  
uh  
yeah  
the link  
hmm  
oh titanium is  
but <unk> th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own  
objection  
mm-hmm  
usually these kind of things consist of a battery infrared diode buttons chips and circuit board  
yeah  
yeah  
the less buttons the better the design  
oh yeah yeah sure  
once in the morning twice in the afternoon  
yeah  
and maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre  
it's really the people twenty five to thirty five  
oh my name's andrew i'm a i'm the market research  
and uh herve assumed that it's going to run longer  
'cause i was too busy carried away doing my own thing which is not obviously not a very good part of a team working thing  
i don't think so  
and for those i calculated um the average  
every fourth you know  
so if you ti  
six  
yeah i think so too in that  
mm-hmm  
and then just put also on l. c. d. on it  
then um i guess that's your bit  
yeah  
yes up the telescope  
okay  
tape free  
now we are supposed to give some <unk> offers right now  
okay  
oh <unk> we uh the okay <unk> here in the middle of the of the operators of the channel and uh volume um changers  
mm  
so you wanna listen to the silent regions  
what do you think of it  
yeah and perhaps the turning on but  
and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something  
and i think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because  
yeah i have to agree all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that <unk> that much now it's only design  
and who has a right to put who has a right to put data on the m. m. m.  
so that just has to be coded  
but i mean essentially you've actually sort of included the information from the slides in the language model  
yes  
and uh that could be cool to to finish it  
yeah sure  
undo  
yeah  
i mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone and she's had it for a long time you know  
yeah  
uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the <unk> the amplifier  
okay  
i mean it's hardly a gimmick it's uh it's totally practical  
yeah  
i find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing  
mean you press a button um the it <unk> goes it sends a signal to a chip which uh translates it into infrared signal of <unk> spatial frequencies  
do you  
if it's an emission line data  
they both they both  
yes  
are we happy  
okay  
yeah it works about the same as a solar powered calculator and you know how those those don't really require that much light  
so for each utterance you have one agreement and one disagreement score  
um i'm not sure  
so times fifteen  
and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david if that's alright  
um which isn't really too many  
di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one  
they <unk> they uh they might be able to  
is that okay we have five minutes  
the network  
i mean i dunno if i'm too slow for this stuff but uh  
alright  
yeah yeah <unk> yeah yeah  
um which we'll have forty minutes for  
like uh bass uh so we need kind of an <unk>  
so i'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control  
okay  
okay  
uh yeah  
here it comes  
yeah  
and basically what you can see here is that it has a little yeah let's say gap which you can put your finger in  
you don't care  
so yeah you won't yeah  
so so another important part of the project is about money uh and about so about finances  
yeah  
as in like it's  
did you get my email with the slides  
i mean do you think it's something for the very next months  
it's in oh yeah it was <unk>  
the pitch isn't that big a deal  
yeah it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh no  
no no  
uh  
ah okay  
we can you away  
so below forty is okay  
um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to <unk> to <unk> the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um  
you can just put it somewhere they they aren't used much not as much as those other so you can put it somewhere  
was initial the plan  
yeah we could just go with um  
uh yeah i think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board it just affected  
yeah  
uh uh  
or the <unk> uh the sideways  
yep  
oh  
and uh well uh it's uh quick i guess  
so our total is fifteen point five  
are we looking at the square or we looking at the construct  
oh okay  
which i will allow sarah to take over  
um  
very very little  
about zapping <unk> and uh and stuff like that  
that's a good point  
he  
like you have on the samsung well i don't like to call brands phones  
into electronic signal which we pass to the infra red l. e. d. which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal  
but it must have like classes for dealing with files  
eighteen and a half damn  
um  
i mean most t. v. <unk> use only treble and bass  
no that is a scroll wheel itself it'll be put in that  
mm-hmm  
come on  
like great keep the phase zero and it works  
whereas speech recognition and l. c. d. screen do offer new functionality in your product  
even though he's right that they make indirect references to it  
mm-hmm  
we were saying earlier about you know do you need all the buttons on the remote control they just make it look ugly  
so normal scroll wheel  
you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out and that's why i'm a bit concerned  
the the label page two should get should be the one <unk> which it is the most similar to or any kind of classification rules you can imagine  
blue one f. eight  
was good teamwork  
so you press the button it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button  
<unk>  
um if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick off meeting with the coffee machine  
because it's i don't know it's just so high tech  
well so this is in the next slide certainly  
well yeah  
uh yeah so  
wa  
uh okay  
yeah we've also got the the me the thing of if we're gonna have a non remote looking remote how do we yeah  
great  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
well at the back  
yeah but i was thinking that maybe it could have been  
it's it it can internally it can quickly recover everything into that disk  
yeah so it they have five and you can go up to fourteen if you want to keep there  
shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty  
you just look at the people you you just have the people to compare those two marbles  
yeah  
hmm  
yeah  
i it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers you know they have uh fruits all round them  
what about the idea of like a round remote  
yeah  
and with that this is the card that we use in the smart meeting room and this is uh the card the um  
mm-hmm  
we we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to  
oh alright  
right but in grow it's everybody has to grow  
yeah  
i think we have to use it also on other televisions though  
a possibility for extra functions like a sliding a sliding piece and a long life battery or a charging station  
yeah  
mm  
components design  
yeah i guess  
mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip  
i don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this or something  
but you'll also forget to put it in because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember  
mm  
so that's fine <unk> before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary  
so  
red and blue components  
fine  
it's a remote control a television remote control  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
and i know what you're all thinking of oh my  
mm-hmm hmm  
it's a miracle  
it might be a problem for me at the stage right now because i based everything on not having those um  
yeah  
um oh i found haven't <unk> it physically yet but uh a reference to uh a ninety two paper  
um and i don't know what we could do for for channels  
so like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in for instance a wooden case  
can you don't know if that's got a name but  
that they're consistent with what you did before  
well you could come up with like novelty ones like they've done with the the mobile phones  
'cause i actually put the the microphones on  
yeah  
okay  
sure sure  
yeah  
should  
we <unk> we could handle it i think  
sure  
yeah  
yeah if you if you enter the big room in the right hand corner i think  
yeah but  
i mean the processing  
we've disc  
'cause it it might be better skimming and less memory required at the same time  
pretty much  
yeah that's okay  
yeah  
with <unk> then you can prepare your slides then present it later  
yeah perhaps  
but let's think about the <unk>  
so you want like a se like a file which is the <unk> of a hash table  
oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars  
well uh okay that's your point  
these are two examples  
we could use velcro  
so i suppose it is it normally uh second years do it like just after they've come back for the <unk>  
so i would i would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh  
the the part  
yeah  
it's this as well sorry we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex new material that we've got  
and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house  
it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device  
mm 'kay  
yeah  
more like fins or  
yeah  
yeah so each of us has a role to do  
i <unk> i like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing  
are we still gonna go for dumping it into a database  
mm-hmm flashy  
how did it get more expensive what did you just change  
uh well there has been <unk> investigation again in the in the remote control market  
mm  
okay  
yeah  
takes your uh  
i think they're fine actually  
well that's good  
and then we've here the menu button and the  
um the marketing expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification  
mm  
and we have the user interface <unk> in here and uh the the l. c. d. and and the scroll are inside  
good point  
at least the um i wasn't explained how to do such a th  
same thing with conceptual design  
it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal  
oh yes sorry you're right  
okay let's keep it option uh keep an option yeah  
okay  
but i think there's more to in than <unk> than what you just said  
okay  
yeah that's great  
yeah but this is just a <unk> general idea  
opening acquaintance tool training and project plan discussion and then closing  
i want one for my own  
uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time  
yes  
yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons so  
half  
or both  
and uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world  
i thought these things did not exist  
let me see  
uh that's the only that's the only drawback i see to this  
yeah so the first you see the main and the other ones you can uh go to uh  
turtle  
yeah  
but it's  
yeah  
animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works  
yeah so but i i don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway  
okay  
okay  
you will go for one  
that was fun  
so i don't know if um uh what i've seen <unk> on our website was uh that the this installation was uh a bit expensive  
um  
i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control  
objects  
so something quite curvy  
uh what do we think a  
yes  
well i will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know  
like your delay  
yeah  
yeah right  
there you go marketing  
um and what you say channel settings or channel programming  
so i could probably i could probably read it from uh that file already  
no cords attached  
especially when the segments are really long  
alright  
uh afterwards uh one could imagine that you for example you can detect that someone is a bit angry or is uh yelling  
yeah  
yeah and i would li i would have liked a kinetic part as well to give it some  
if i just keep all them so twenty l. s. f. <unk> each one is um  
we'll have more of an idea when the prototype  
you see  
how we could <unk> like adapt it to our  
oh okay  
mm-hmm  
but why why do we need uh the flipping uh  
mm-hmm  
and we have solar cells  
and is and the <unk> result was no  
yeah  
so there are flats there are single curve and there are double curves  
th uh m. g. b. led  
yes  
i think push buttons is  
or we could uh come to some <unk> uh final conclusions  
oh  
but it can be a little bit overwhelming so the user <unk> ones just focus on ease of use  
mm  
seeing that realistically with the given time frame we're not gonna do amazing new things from now on  
uh those kind of things  
yeah yeah  
supplements l. c. d.  
i think this one over ran just before  
i think it yeah you you will do an  
not enough  
uh what's tomorrow is the <unk> tomorrow the <unk> first  
user interface design <unk> industrial design  
right  
yeah  
we made a top oh or a front view  
uh there's an a a <unk> aesthetic value but not functionality  
uh it's <unk>  
that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them what was bad what they used  
uh the numbers which is pretty straight forward  
okay  
it's a one i think  
and i can get my bus  
<unk>  
okay cool  
these these will be bigger in the the real design  
mm yeah  
yeah but <unk> i i'm not completely um completely clear uh i yeah about the spinning wheel  
mm-hmm  
uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the t. v.  
ah okay mm-hmm  
yeah so  
yeah  
no  
i just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever  
they've just revived that right  
some of them you can do it on a single meeting  
at the end of the day whether it works properly or not  
is it there  
but i mean i imagine the same sort of approach could be taken with yours as well  
and it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh word  
x. marks spot  
if we wanted something  
oh yeah just to be a prick but of course you can talk to your remote control it doesn't do anything  
yeah people are gonna have their favourite <unk> whether they do that or whether they  
but it's just an an added feature feature  
you know so i mean that and the disposable income and i don't think it's something to ignore you know  
okay cool  
so we can just if they want they can just pay another  
with <unk> i have three four times real time  
to put it on your head  
so does everyone want to say who they are  
yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight  
oh no i i interrupted you sorry  
do you have a sense about that  
okay  
mm  
or  
well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so  
and it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data  
um and then like a locator so you know kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone  
that might make sense because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what  
no  
yeah i think so  
so it really exceed the requirements 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions which  
so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip  
so what were we looking at this page for anyway  
um  
yeah yeah  
is that better to see  
oh sorry <unk>  
right  
no  
you just use the wheel  
but i <unk> i don't know it's if it is feasible because i don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy  
i mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged  
yeah  
i i noticed that  
now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it  
those are really good  
yeah  
hmm  
okay  
'kay  
or shape it it could be as fancy as you want it to be  
and at the moment you're at sort of a point where maybe you have to make that choice a little bit  
and uh if we go down i mean maybe in terms of shot here we can see that  
and also the tuning part  
yeah  
uh we have titan  
some  
you can maybe just just  
mm-hmm  
could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there  
oh okay  
it's it's a little but it it's everywhere  
okay solar cells zero  
should work  
i think we could've done even better with a little bit more information like what's a single curved case how many colours what do colours count  
mm-hmm  
but uh i think a user need  
the button oh  
um but it uh it doesn't  
and three  
we should bring new technologies for young peoples and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push <unk> toward the internet  
like  
or girls or older people  
it wasn't like we were alone for very long so you didn't <unk> go off and think  
<unk>  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
done  
uh  
but yeah th that's the plan  
good  
we can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button  
or with one uh <unk> che only the t. v.  
well it says that  
i don't know  
oh that's that's fine then  
an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes  
yeah  
so then you have to <unk> you know you have to train models for  
yeah  
no no  
okay and marketing expert it's me  
yeah i mean it's it's crazy  
because remember there is also this <unk> arriving um on the new project  
totally it takes cheap speech recognition she they <unk>  
um i think that's it  
mm  
yeah so you need to draw 'em in something  
right  
mm-hmm  
okay i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing  
okay  
mm-hmm  
but for that at the moment my display code needs that thing to work the one oh no that's working at the moment anyway  
so we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition  
so just just just just think about it um  
hmm  
well hold on  
right well if we make it like this i think if you  
this is something that is added on the top  
mm 'kay  
yeah  
and and actually i <unk> um i can start playing and uh looking at the this uh in detail  
oh yeah  
true  
yep  
but what what what but what you can do well if in the in the initial configuration you can re use a triangle  
so even speech synthesis they're also uh introduced this w. e. r. term so  
a and we changed something i guess or not  
good timing  
yes  
from my very  
hmm  
thank you perfect  
but i'm just <unk> i mean what you can imagine someone saying well how did they decide to make it blue  
yeah  
i mean it hides all those function  
yeah  
it's not the purpose to be handy it's  
or whether like whether the post processing utilities are a separate step  
then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of <unk> you know rechargeable units  
so um okay so this is what people find annoying about remote controls  
i'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change  
yep  
we're not in milan or paris  
yeah with the chip and then i mean  
but i i don't know  
maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it  
um yeah  
um  
well um yeah  
but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used  
yeah  
is that being too generous  
the ones i i've uh received from the account manager  
i don't know  
it'll come up it um uh no signal  
oh okay okay you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff  
into this room  
so that <unk> uh when people are uh happy with that they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us  
well couldn't the <unk> oh no then we would have to override though  
or you want to go to the kitchen  
so  
no special colour  
okay do we have any <unk> some questions for this let's see um  
these i'm sorry  
and then and then  
right exactly  
well i've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so a hundred people  
uh like a. t. is uh  
okay just hang on a second everybody  
where is that thing  
yeah  
uh-huh  
right i mean so now we see shot seven i suppose yeah  
maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have  
we've only got a couple of minutes  
exactly yeah  
yeah you click on that guy  
okay  
so basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time um and gonna go through you  
it doesn't get much fancier  
then yes  
uh in a <unk> <unk>  
the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf  
yep  
no  
um well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several  
yeah that's fine  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
um yeah  
one uh microphone  
but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and <unk>  
oh we could yeah  
abdul al <unk> is my name  
and that's all i got  
lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the  
so we're not really going for something that's uh  
<unk>  
yep  
yeah that's difficult  
i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out moded teletext  
yeah yeah  
what's the name  
so  
okay  
signal control panel  
at the bottom of the docking station or whatever  
right  
uh right i'm responsible for working design uh this is basically the inside going on of the  
in in  
uh well there are <unk> at least uh basic functions uh like just th the channels uh one till nine  
i see  
whoa  
so some people may want to say i want to see this channel  
yeah yeah because it's <unk> uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so  
i wonder if we put a. or b. somewhere instead of a number  
agree  
like have a it's like instead of saying like you should like work on both side you know the text and the speech aspect of it  
it's a  
but i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic  
uh innovation i think fits into what we're talking about here with design  
so um if there is information displayed under the the sheets uh the it won't be um very useful  
that's a sketching of my my elk and it it is my favourite animal right now 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature  
all i was saying is that these different measures are a way to uh evaluate the identity of the person  
no no no  
okay  
some buttons have icons like the play and stop but we don't use that  
um oh <unk> a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost  
and for in the display it's probably better if you have whole utterances than i don't know  
<unk>  
i think we took that everything they wanted into consideration  
and then you then you look for combinations of them  
uh i made a little uh  
so they they adapt to it pretty soon i guess  
and if you wanted to go onto teletext or i know we're not having that but i mean a similar thing you  
yeah  
um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands  
finally my opinion  
usually goes to it  
okay  
yeah i was wanting to talk about the search  
well  
it's at least on the positive side  
everybody wanting to change channel in the same time  
twelve  
so i i yeah would ha it would be as a separate tier where just to mark  
yeah <unk> when the batteries are low  
um  
mm-hmm  
you are you have just to to decide uh yeah what what what uh what you want to work first and and and <unk>  
um  
is it that one  
yeah yeah you can just and you need some kind of i dunno  
so he is using minimum of minimum is uh i think <unk> i don't twelve point five milliseconds i think  
one of your you two  
i was just wondering if you were gonna define this more on the slides to come or if this is as much as you're gonna tell us  
and you can have them at home  
what  
i think uh when we think it over i <unk> i think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money  
okay  
um  
okay  
um like it's just been brought up again then  
mm there's a system issue again so we should be consistent and keep it  
and now we have to calculate the production costs  
yeah  
if one disk has crashed crashed then you can recover everything  
and then uh how do you hand chunk stuff right  
but i dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes  
i would lose the c. and just name it triple r.  
what is a  
yeah what i did at the moment is um i um yeah i got the f. zero values from for each speaker for his headphone  
yeah  
only animal i could thin i could draw  
yes  
okay this is the agenda  
uh the curve  
but but there <unk> we should also have a <unk> a means of dealing with proper names when we don't know what it is or how it might be spelled at all and and flagging that in in some way  
construct four okay  
no  
hmm  
yeah so that's the point  
yeah  
because  
right sure  
yeah okay because of the l. c. d. screen  
um  
i will design it we design it later  
so component cost is going to be the least  
is th is this a curve  
but i <unk> can't open that because it <unk> asks uh for some <unk> or password  
yeah  
um alright so we've got some ideas we've got um  
there we go  
i'm really on the lowest level  
so it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television  
what yeah yeah  
uh  
<unk> <unk>  
i i understand exactly  
okay cool  
what do you think  
yeah alright oh right  
it's clunky  
i figured just put 'em all together  
oh yeah  
<unk> no <unk> what else  
and so you you don't know exactly  
our bosses will be rich  
mm  
so maybe we could get rid of that as well  
yeah  
so you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here  
just in case you're wondering why is he still playing with the play doh  
i guess we could introduce a different um  
yeah  
so you can uh draw a yeah  
okay  
uh you notice a new name in the room uh at the centre upper upper side  
um well usually the power button is on top i guess  
technical functions i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing the size of the buttons  
mm-hmm  
okay so  
it's the uh it's it's overall  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay right  
yeah  
make this  
so if you'll rather draw in paint or something  
uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing  
our main objectives were simplicity and fashion  
so that's probably why most controls are still infrared  
yeah  
does that make sense  
yeah i think we would also need two of those  
yeah  
get this out of the way  
brilliant  
yeah  
yeah  
yep i like  
well uh save the document and then uh  
you still like it  
um  
builds  
not what to do  
that's our new product  
five  
um okay well first thoughts on um  
yes  
so we have to  
yeah  
yes  
mm  
we haven't got a lot of expensive components in there  
mm no  
yeah  
after they'd done that to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls  
mm-hmm  
but if we use the l. c. d. uh even the radio frequency communication with the t. v. set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff  
mm  
i. g. m. i've done again  
didn't notice  
i you know on the basis that um that you know if we're going for making it a fashion statement  
uh this is fantastic  
yeah  
your big beautiful bird  
like buttons for <unk> uh tuning the channels and stuff like that  
don't destroy my giraffe  
something like something like this or like where you give sort of a reference to a beginning and an end position  
and i think that's that's why companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> made a lot of progress  
no but the thing is the display calls methods which probably expect some so i think if the display itself isn't doing anything <unk>  
it's just for t. v. but for  
that's a really cool feature and it has to make them wanna buy it again  
so  
so they cluster the buttons together  
but that's not possible to fill in so we have to round it  
um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect functional aspect but also the simplicity  
but i think it will probably just uh i mean it probably won't matter too much to the other linguists that we're having other people there  
people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to so  
yeah  
yeah exactly yeah  
exactly  
yeah uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options a rechargeable <unk> module actually  
mm  
right  
like a <unk> yes  
let's say in r. s. s.  
okay okay  
yeah  
mm  
so can you give us a time that would be good for you  
hmm  
buttons  
or  
so you do one <unk> you can do one integrated scroll wheel push button  
so  
but you can break you you can but you can break one when you break one you don't cast off the mold yourself it happens automatically  
i  
uh-huh  
right  
so let me check a different one  
ah no  
but you can put a play and stop and and rewind  
like would would the display for example still be able to just say i want from whatever from the first until the last and and everything in between sort of and and the data manager would then display that just for that meeting  
uh yeah so i think this is uh this is a very good uh and a yeah  
i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires maybe before we <unk> make a decision  
we have no  
yeah we should also <unk> the the number of buttons  
so  
oh okay  
and i'm guessing from what you say yeah  
um if you flip the  
yeah something like if ha i did that one 'cause it is well a language teacher wouldn't low allow that to mo move on to the next stage  
plastic is free  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things  
mm  
but i think <unk>  
yep  
yeah  
i don't know if you've got the same  
yeah that's true  
yeah two yeah  
right handed yeah  
even for the <unk> um because the the vocabulary the  
it's curved  
yeah because we look at competitors and <unk> if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design  
i've got all the scripts set up  
oh okay  
seventy five percent of users they zap lot so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot  
and i think of course uh i it applies to everything  
okay  
you do have it in your mobile phone though don't you  
hmm  
we have moose too  
yeah i think she said twenty seconds to um  
or yeah  
ah  
but that's not for me to decide but that's maybe something for marketing to look into  
it is curved but  
so uh 'cause she's running at the moment  
good  
hmm  
alright  
maybe four it's okay  
it's been implemented at twelve hundred <unk> bits per second using more more complicated <unk> schemes and stuff like that i think  
whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control  
um so at the moment it's more of a box focus  
but we don't design the t. v.  
that uh uh uh so  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
gonna say okay  
'kay  
it's not the other way  
well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet  
oh  
okay  
we need to find that out  
does anyone have any questions  
it <unk>  
well the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well  
mm-hmm  
okay  
um yes but <unk> we  
mm-hmm  
we have a pen  
alright  
<unk> it's it's  
next time  
um i think um a logo our company logo and the slogan should be or could be yeah why not  
um well there are some changes in the design requirements so there are some changes in the method also  
his name was ed and it took me a whole time to you find out that it was actually mister ed  
but it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes  
true right  
it's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff  
yeah but the primary colours <unk> we can uh create with the with the <unk> on the on the remote control  
mm-hmm  
yeah i think there are people yeah  
um regular you could link with the scroll button  
yeah and they want to pay for it and uh  
yeah you can yeah  
then we try a little bit direct show to see um uh to to have an idea of how how long uh that could be  
yeah but we we we are we have yellow red uh black titanium  
yeah  
a couple of these items here  
but uh um something um using this relationship uh between the slides uh and other even other <unk> textual support and the uh and the speech  
because basically it's like they're reading them at different speeds but you know in which order they are said  
no uh that's coo it's cool  
and uh we will be able to uh start uh evaluating uh the prototypes  
it's true  
hmm  
because people really are looking for a remote that's more high tech  
okay thank you  
what button  
mm-hmm  
yeah but the thing is um  
hmm  
you <unk> mm-hmm  
okay  
um simple would go with the <unk>  
okay  
so i <unk> i'll bring this one back to him  
and then you go uh  
i go for future r. c. probably  
you can do it with your thumb  
yeah but then you look forward  
<unk> wood is i can't <unk> how do you uh i mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and  
mm  
ah okay  
yeah  
uh we have green now uh  
<unk>  
maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with  
some circular area  
mm-hmm  
<unk> right  
and then you can scroll choose an option click on it it goes into an feature  
yeah mm  
sorry i i um i'm afraid  
as you said they come with the t. v. so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions so maybe we could think about colour  
that's <unk> information we don't need  
um  
so i will play role of the secretary  
it's in real media so it's very compressed  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so  
mm-hmm  
i added many slides every time yeah  
<unk> yeah  
oh very good  
was talking about <unk> lines okay  
but that really over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes so that just goes back to  
yeah yeah  
oh alright  
you just roll  
because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball  
oh well  
and uh also <unk> uh uh <unk> because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery it should not uh consume lots of energy  
yeah  
oh i see  
oh of course <unk> there's no reason why we can't make a development version that displays both has two win utterance windows and uh two graphical displays  
are are people really gonna use it though  
so  
<unk>  
we have to make our decisions what we want to do  
volume  
uh well basically uh it hunts for prey but it does it always in a very well thought way  
i think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that  
okay  
yeah by by a by a part of it crosses over itself  
i'd call these quite uh minimalist  
uh how about the leadership  
i think i that's your department yes because <unk> he already knows what  
should be about one point <unk> seven yeah  
a rabbit  
that's great  
other  
yeah  
you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case  
okay but  
okay it's maybe a bit too too flashy too yeah  
let me save that  
yeah  
yeah mm  
mm-hmm  
and the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that  
oh a g. p. s. system internal g. p. s.  
uh um it's only altering earlier rules  
new remote  
yeah yeah  
okay  
so  
but statistic and uh and something approaches  
the display  
or or <unk> in it  
because does he somehow put the information about was the size about the frame to the feature vector itself or he's throwing away this framing  
ones that ones that look high tech too  
uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes so we should keep that in mind  
i mean you don't wanna make this really formal or do you  
mm-hmm  
mm  
okay  
or can it be altered in a certain way or does the actually user program it to say a channel means this  
but i think i could see i could imagine that this could be a reasonable process to do  
not the old one but yeah  
um what so <unk> what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about  
five minutes  
thank you very much  
hmm  
okay safety  
so this is hierarchical normally so you have scenes and shots but  
and uh to to manage uh all the the conference aspects uh uh we have in a conference automatically  
there we go  
sure  
so you so i thought i understood you to mean exploring the figure  
um because in the <unk> <unk> spectrum it does that and it does that  
just uh do that quickly  
it is  
two point five milliseconds  
this is uh two times as less important and uh same for this one  
we're now talking about the <unk>  
yeah but then we all <unk> uh on the same task  
and i i felt the first two meetings that i was coming in with no information and not sort of  
okay  
it was you  
mm yeah  
so what is it that ties um different acts together at a higher level you know  
yeah  
yeah 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy  
the whether the product demonstrates technical innovation  
yeah that's right  
yeah  
no problem  
okay here is our agenda for this meeting  
cool  
if i could  
i mean like the  
well the i guess that goes with the utterance who's speaking  
right right  
uh will take a look at the the working design  
i think you've got to do um control f. eight  
okay  
<unk>  
<unk>  
so i think we can keep the wheel  
so that alpha thing is how much do you trust the text on the page and how much do you trust the links  
probably it's uh it's <unk> be a good idea if you have <unk> two uh with um with source like uh books or web page centre  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
you've done it again  
um  
like glow in the dark um which does already <unk> exist but it's not very widely used i don't think  
as per latest technology and it should be environmental safe  
yeah  
i guess not  
so that you don't have so many buttons to deal with  
we started at twelve  
so  
i guess i don't buy enough equipment  
yeah that's fair enough  
isn't that how it works that you <unk> look look at <unk>  
um however this is where we kinda have to be very i think creative about it  
um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them  
the the there's no fu there's one there's one button that's <unk> there's there's there's one function and that's <unk> the one button when you want to find it  
<unk> yes  
so i presume oh wait i have the exact email  
but um maybe i'll go <unk> to the board  
special colour  
lights  
um  
yeah  
but i i i think that the user would like <unk> would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers  
all the other all the other um buttons such as <unk> um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used  
they haven't got that far  
that be it  
channels  
you <unk> right yeah  
yeah  
first i wanna hear from you  
for this one it's a normal battery  
well maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs where the parent says you cannot watch channel seven  
i'd put it at one i think but i dunno what do you  
um yeah yeah  
like um the colour scheme names and stuff  
so still  
other than that no one really had any tight constraints from what i've heard  
five euro  
it does not get lost easily  
alright  
to talk to the to the t. v. maybe  
oh yeah type  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or  
excellent  
mm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yes  
yeah but the rubbers alls original black  
yeah  
yeah  
in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that's the one i talked about last time  
those two things  
what's bad about them um i looked at their flaws so we're going to look at their flaws everything  
mm-hmm  
and it can read uh how does it read from which um from which uh how to state it  
otherwise <unk> wet <unk> <unk> yeah  
okay  
super pig  
yeah i think it does s. v. j. uh s. v. j. output  
but our des design experts will uh work that out  
euros  
wheel  
yeah anything i mean  
and um a way the way uh it is implemented now uh to detect yes  
well it depends you know like  
or it's then a regular  
wall space and  
maybe they have the compression standards and again coding stand but maybe uh i i read ah yeah  
right  
yeah  
they haven't addressed this problem  
mm  
okay  
my screen is gone  
twenty five euros  
yeah that's that would be really interesting actually  
okay  
mm  
mm  
then it'll be just easier to understand <unk> what the <unk> the whole thing does  
th the um which one you is gonna look at what it does so far and you'll just <unk> try out do that  
if we're gonna have one left handed and one right handed then i would give it a one but otherwise otherwise a two  
mm mm mm  
but for instance th i i'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have  
yeah  
okay um  
for the future  
like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too right  
yeah  
i think it just means that we can't add any more to it now  
yeah  
you shake it and scream at it  
when when you uh put them all in the same place  
later down the line  
uh-huh  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
no eh  
okay  
um  
simple and  
yeah  
uh  
like two one three  
thank you  
that's that's right yeah yeah  
like you don't have to individually um <unk> all the screws  
yeah  
and if it was mid <unk> uh if it was you'd put it in  
uh based on the kind of graphic object you have so tables questions  
mm  
yes  
yeah  
great seeing y'all  
you know yeah  
um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time  
'cause people are gonna say exchange structure so what  
yeah  
yes  
um <unk> and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself  
channel up and volume  
yeah  
mm  
um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner  
and yeah for <unk> one months or so then uh the uh the i uh i. v. c. uh <unk> with the people at <unk> have uh yeah  
well we did take everything into consideration of course  
yeah that's one of the requirement  
but certainly when it comes to like uh the the opal <unk> of temporal <unk>  
might be <unk>  
um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote  
it automatically has the the programme and the volume function  
mm-hmm  
this is the infra red section so you <unk> it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it  
i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back up of the battery  
yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to  
uh yeah  
oh you mean that it would be nice to plot at least <unk>  
is anyone of you for the for the document frequency over total frequency you gonna have total frequencies of words then with that right  
well what  
yeah  
previous page yeah indeed  
<unk>  
nice  
yeah  
what i really miss also is uh  
i guess <unk> you know we we say a uh big blue bump or a soft or a continuum  
so i guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires  
then we just mean it over the utterance  
which is fair enough  
i think maybe some companies definitely do insure you can't really have so many backups  
unfortunately we haven't been given as much space as we would have liked but that's always the case  
it's come up with what we've you know the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing hasn't it all seems to be there  
we had uh made our decisions about uh  
yeah  
yeah i mean it would  
like we got a cherry one  
you have this space here and then you have this thing on the side as well or at the bottom  
not a mouse a rat  
computation  
i mean uh you make like eleven and a half euros profit  
uh for a remote control does he have all the  
according to the drawings  
in terms uh maybe even in terms of innovation i mean if you think about this which is you know what uh they said  
and then you see how all these things this two little works or the statistical independence  
but it has no functionality for our remote at all  
uh i think it is  
um so  
if we are using the television in the different environments  
hmm  
and uh the last one is adaptive  
so  
that's right  
to give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking  
well actually do you want the average duration  
ant  
okay  
and so the last thing i thought <unk> which i quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people  
<unk> let's see where the pen go  
you know we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have  
so you could could present that  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
so anyone uh any questions for now  
you know i i don't see the point of dividing over the the whole stuff  
so  
yeah audi audio settings and screen settings we need those like audio settings mono stereo  
joe doesn't live here anymore right  
um did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics  
yeah understand  
because the buttons will be uh <unk> will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings  
yeah  
um our project uh finance uh  
so we'll arrange it in a nice little order  
the selling point yeah  
and it can be correlated to energy solar energy so for the marketing aspect you know saying that it's <unk>  
'cause i'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision yeah  
and make that a fashion symbol as well  
oh yeah we have to <unk> uh include that in our design as well  
you had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case  
i'm  
so maybe we'll loose a few option uh options but i think i this is more important  
alright  
it's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling  
i like sports um yeah aerobics <unk> spinning um and uh  
right okay um right  
uh probably  
uh i mean uh  
mm-hmm  
off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere  
so we need to close the meeting  
presumably you can access from web mail or you know or i. map or whatever  
yeah <unk> maybe you'd be a bit too yeah  
i'm just thinking totally different designs also  
ding ding  
yeah yeah sometimes it's like a little bit rushed  
and one  
i mean okay there's  
yeah  
and i'll start work in say two  
i mean i <unk> yeah it's personal taste but  
yeah  
mm yeah  
well if you don't no  
so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode  
okay oh yeah you are you cannot or <unk> <unk> uh by doing one one day a week mm you know just i think the cards  
next  
mm-hmm  
that's alright if you can just look it up on your computer <unk> uh um people between twenty five to thirty five  
mm-hmm  
those are the most important ones  
depends on the sensitivity of the microphone but i think that's okay  
<unk> you need to be able to see the effects of this  
it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we <unk> may think that would have been the most important  
yeah  
the prototype  
yeah  
okay so use uh very uh lot of <unk>  
mostly you know <unk> four or <unk> six buttons  
okay  
yeah switch the whole group  
hmm  
so for  
the same signalling  
why not switching them from yeah that office  
um  
yes  
mm  
hmm  
yeah  
i don't know it's open yet  
especially when uh they're saying we're <unk> we're choosing low red shift absorption  
'kay  
um  
yeah they've all got an i. d. for each utterance  
no  
yeah we can have  
yeah  
so that's pretty much it for the working design  
yeah  
there is f. x. that is doing something very similar to to what we do here basically  
right  
hmm  
okay  
primarily  
i'll just fill it in  
i think i think that will be <unk> revolutionary  
go for it  
then rubber would be the best as a material indeed  
a what  
blended ion lines yeah  
it can be curved  
i really have to get out of here  
yeah that's  
but i mean  
uh <unk> horses no particular reason why  
so yeah <unk> the  
futuristic  
no one  
um  
go away  
i i have one thing left  
really  
um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last  
is it fashionable uh yeah i guess we should write these down so we can reference them  
i mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it  
chew proof  
do you have many questions  
what about a  
yeah can you um uh <unk> i think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of l. c. d. uh screens  
or only a scroll wheel  
yeah  
oh no we no it's uh  
i'm sorry  
um  
it's a common uh technology uh like i told um uh the circuit board it's the most um important uh  
mm-hmm  
you could of said shut up you fool  
okay  
i you're  
i mean if  
and uh  
so we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis  
the the uh the the sort of abstracts deadline first because we need to have a meeting and that's gonna be when all the real work starts  
ah okay  
yeah  
so that let's see what you're doing  
but uh to just use simple <unk> it will uh basically mark um all the word fragments for you and uh you know  
yeah  
hmm  
it's just that yeah let's let's hear from you first  
yeah okay  
but uh it's nothing <unk> to do with <unk> and it's using uh uh the open c. v. and uh some classes from uh jean marc uh for  
industrial designer  
yeah  
no hard feelings  
i don't mind  
right  
okay  
mm-hmm  
but now we have only the buttons  
okay  
never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out  
mm  
yeah  
um so that's red and black  
oh that was profiting that was an amount so that's the amount made okay  
what were your  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
uh grey and yellow or black and yellow  
yeah  
yeah we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator  
but  
mm mm lapel  
yeah  
um  
but  
but how did how do you get out of the menu then  
yeah so yeah kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold and then if you had  
true  
oh  
what is r. s. i.  
no  
triple r.  
but exactly  
the l. c. d. is still on disc is still open to discussion  
that's counting  
because i think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh  
but for now it's l. c. d.  
does it have ears  
yeah  
i don't care  
so that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left  
so instead of pressing the channel number i am choosing the <unk> directly  
uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks  
if they're if they're really options  
okay  
um the i. d. which is who  
at least yeah with the interface it's quite funny to to see um <unk> that the <unk> quickly you can do something in in yeah  
so even if it is really user friendly to us but we're used to using menus all the time  
um we've decided not to include them and make it a specific just a specific television um function  
yeah  
so  
can you like yeah just <unk> we can visualize it  
find replace yeah  
so without l. c. d. i just take it five  
yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so  
you can see it all here  
i've also known people to have things like like a <unk> watch they wear from time to time  
but i thought it was just completely pointless  
from uh last year i was uh uh <unk> uh supervising the annotation of segmentation  
and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function  
um the new project requirements first of all um we didn't speak about it but we should not um support teletext in the remote  
um yeah  
i mean uh  
yeah  
yeah we have also some slides  
yeah  
yeah  
good point  
um 'cause you know it does not have to be a oblong box  
easier to use  
but this has to be has to be trendy and uh and  
true  
no that's what i was thinking  
so it it in to spare the details basically they've they've got a variable here  
four point three no  
uh i don't need the times i just need the words  
i don't think i'm gonna be able to do um the speech tools through java native interface 'cause the documentation for them is horrific  
yeah and we can just some strawberry first  
yes  
mm-hmm  
google is is simple works fine  
yeah  
so yeah  
if they cannot recover it then i can just get all the data from <unk> and put back the c. t. s. system  
were there any was there anything that you found difficult or anything  
i like that idea  
i don't know  
are we gonna do that or not  
we can use wood and titanium  
if first time see the thing you <unk> didn't adjust uh set the microphone and then you lose it then you have lost it  
and everything else has stayed pretty much the same so  
uh  
we're not  
well <unk> uh <unk> no it doesn't solve the problem but it's <unk> what is it  
i do however have this from over my head that they don't want teletext on it  
that's right  
let's go  
what do you guys feel about the process  
i no  
it can be done for <unk>  
yeah yeah  
at all  
um so we can play with the video  
yes but across meetings um there will be the same topic several times  
yeah you said that  
colours were under format right  
mm-hmm  
uh rubber wood or titanium  
okay  
yeah that's right we didn't even rea  
mm-hmm yep  
for example if you let's see put it this here  
but but uh if you get the project et cetera in any case it's something that jean marc and me we want to do  
and making it a bright colour helps with the personally i would have gone for purple  
and i didn't mention that we need a power button in our last i can give you an example here of uh good layout and bad layout  
yeah  
oh  
okay  
a five  
would <unk> would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that  
okay so i'll go back maybe to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem what we should choose  
no not quite  
yeah  
this one comes in under price as you can see but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design  
and uh uh th uh the shape  
yeah you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it you want something you can definitely grip  
and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics  
um so la last week i tried it with a one kilo hertz sound  
if you have seven pages you can go up and down  
i ha i haven't thought of any particular fruit but the general aspect of the of the remote control  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
sample yeah this one  
ah excellent just what we need  
it's something we really put work into  
do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget <unk> <unk> kind of feature or well it was something about how we lose them  
yeah but if you are using the the normal functions the the basic functions you normally press them on the <unk> yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
excuse me  
definitely  
<unk>  
yeah  
mm  
that's fine  
yeah  
so yeah  
right  
um  
yeah  
yeah just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism  
it's too bad for the speaker  
two million oh yeah two million  
no  
right  
um yeah probably  
and it's  
can i close this  
so i <unk> i took that out  
mm oh so it is  
right okay  
okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things  
'kay  
so the especially the audio channel is absolutely awful  
so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product  
and like ten minutes of that would be probably set up time as well  
ah  
yeah  
but um  
great wonderful ron cool  
go ahead and erase this  
<unk> it's it's  
so maybe that's where the problem is coming from  
it sort of reminds me of the ipod  
so like what i said you probably need like a battery and something else  
it should be uh <unk> at all times  
uh <unk> <unk> do you agree  
right  
so in that way  
just could you please check if it is the first one or the second  
production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate  
yeah they're  
but uh but <unk> um the uh lining up the <unk> two is gonna take we <unk> he's working on a <unk> script for the sound but not for so the one that's got the sound on it  
so we have both  
but it's only if i go back to it i tick okay again  
mm-hmm  
yeah maybe at least <unk> not bigger than this i guess  
i think a lot of that's proprietary anyways  
<unk> why not go for the twenty  
it's a <unk> a combination of a lion and tiger  
mm-hmm  
if i had <unk> if i had to spend twenty five euro  
that's true  
yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it in combination with your  
yep  
mm-hmm  
you're right  
and b. <unk> eyes  
and if you look at the two the <unk> all possible pairs of marble  
make sure once we have a list of the things that we think we're getting of it that it matches her intentions for what we were supposed to get out of it  
yeah  
uh do we need special colour  
yeah  
i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form  
the <unk> 'cause it's not yellow anymore  
so ten fifty if we want an l. c. d. <unk> display that's seven fifty  
yes  
okay um  
the thing is i'm away this weekend  
thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five  
mm  
and i mean as you say i mean that delay is i mean you can squash that delay to some extent right  
i think we do  
huh  
so you never have to change the battery  
so they can play with it it's quite good  
you know i  
yeah  
i don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions  
yeah  
for example if you um can <unk> programme in like numbers one through ten and <unk> programme say you know  
well you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place  
and we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you  
and then yes the whole thing  
alright so um whoever wants to get up next you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want  
just take a named entity which has a really high what's it called d. f. i. d. f. whatever  
so mm uh uh so uh so what are the opinions  
good morning again  
yep  
i mean i i i i know you're saying  
very official  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
<unk> just a bit nicer calling people by their names i think  
huh  
backup  
oh yeah  
oh that'd be quite a good one actually  
maybe you can hear it  
the green  
blank yes  
for your first <unk> it's lovely  
yeah so it's always after <unk> you never have to it before  
banana is more <unk> as compared to this i think and to <unk>  
okay  
right okay so um  
um buttons that don't require you know very firm pushing if they respond  
a <unk>  
um expensive no  
if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus  
so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market  
i mean i yeah yeah i i just care for the written one  
okay  
huh  
i think if you want <unk> to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh <unk> uh i dunno  
so my name's bob morris  
i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other because you go higher and down  
did you present <unk> everything you wanted to  
i i <unk> i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements  
okay  
yeah  
uh battery indicator  
right  
been cool  
yeah just kind of  
um have a think about it  
so  
i think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the <unk> on on remote control  
i mean it requires cameras with pretty good quality et cetera  
yeah he was uh quoting that paper also like <unk> he was telling this uh this is kind of <unk> criteria what this temporal decomposition is doing like  
so <unk> basically this deals with special users children handicapped people  
uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also  
no but it yeah  
format  
mm 'kay  
yeah  
you're not gonna be able to you like command a <unk> with our remote  
that's too bad  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah that'd be nice  
so it's it's you never ask the model to do hard clustering of documents  
i think it's it's easier to have it something like  
yeah it's um the data manager should be quite well documented  
and uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or  
not only possibly even materials like the type of plastic used but everything including size and shape of buttons  
yeah  
um  
suppose we're just getting on with all our  
okay  
the software that i've used uh <unk> pools uh the blinks so will add it on  
it  
periods  
yeah i know  
mm-hmm  
okay now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff  
okay  
sure two  
they have no relations for things like reject or agree  
it's a quick on off button  
so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria  
automatic segmentation at which level  
so we still uh we still have the primary colours  
that was the  
okay have you got a presentation to make  
um we could do <unk> a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids you know  
mm  
and also 'cause uh i have uh read some of the m. o. t. a. uh corpus  
sure  
so i did have it somewhere  
it's just wheat it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh  
yep yep  
i mean will people just use the battery if there's no if there's  
a man <unk> <unk>  
so it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy so  
applying some <unk> filtering  
mm-hmm  
they're ears by the way  
yeah but they would be the same they'd both be the same <unk> feature whereas here they're two <unk> features  
uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or <unk>  
i weak <unk> relative to what though  
so we <unk>  
yeah  
but i think what we should say is when i put out this call  
well i i i i think that <unk> just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the  
mm  
no of course yeah  
yeah  
okay  
no i don't of course  
right to do the um the design i have i've had a look online  
so just put a start and end time on each part  
shit  
that's what i said ice sculptures  
yeah  
we had the special colour  
no uh of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in  
economic  
so it's it's yeah it's three hundred  
okay  
do you want an extra button  
but has to break  
yeah  
and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels  
<unk>  
yeah  
uh  
if the <unk> if they put in the outline uh let's say title one title two then you'll you find title one title two  
that's could comes with it and you can buy so we can make extra money  
like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff  
you can touch it  
well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually  
okay  
function f. eight  
yeah the um that's the point  
um yeah 'cause that's the yeah <unk> other than you have from what i've heard about it is both x. m. l.  
the l. c. d.  
it was very good  
mm-hmm  
i agree  
but probably quick and simple is primary rather than  
mm-hmm  
six  
even shape  
oh come back screen  
yeah  
like uh control pads you know of games but or is that a bit ridiculous
