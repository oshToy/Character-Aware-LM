need to collect information  
so  
um most standard uh have volume of course and a mute function and of course the next and previous channel  
but they <unk> they don't have any measure like you have an original speech you transcribe it and  
um though  
uh so  
you know susceptible to coding errors let's say  
okay  
of course  
you just go round and it is a bit weird at first but it's actually very like fast  
push button interface  
so this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier  
then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to <unk> um sarah present the evaluation criteria  
that's new  
and which is sort of building upon what you know <oos> and others have worked on in terms of  
we propose to put the lounge uh in the room at the the upper side on on the right  
right  
uh i i have video  
yeah  
record and a uh no  
uh button no  
mm-hmm  
okay you're very enthusiastic about your own design huh  
well i'll try and get <unk> of her again today and see what  
and it tries to do everything as fast as possible  
maybe  
and l. c. d. <unk> we can have l. c. d. <unk>  
that yeah but you would never um type the <oos> spelling for anything  
yeah maybe it has a different constructor when you create it  
you are yes  
so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one <unk> kind of case  
so there are again cost functions and <unk>  
because the same customer will come back to buy other add ons  
my <oos> beagle  
mm-hmm  
that's true  
you can see the buttons better of course  
so  
yeah yeah  
um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were um back to our kick off meeting this morning  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
and creativity  
i think it's a two but  
but um what we have what we can do and how we will be able to do  
that's pretty much it  
yep  
no  
you speak with such authority on the matter  
november  
okay  
yeah  
well <unk> should i draw the picture of the animal  
um it might work for volume and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that but not for channels right  
and then there's this at the moment the <unk> the s. v. g. stuff can output ones which aren't closed <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
costs on uh no redesign  
and it it this is not uh  
yeah  
is it  
yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive  
a tracker yeah  
i don't know  
and then the work went on in <oos> i i don't know what you guys did while you were together maybe that was a bit different  
yeah  
yes the uh yeah it <unk> it's for  
i mean we have some or something different technology but  
okay  
like yeah for us  
and when you say what a construct  
and then picking yeah  
okay so can you go down uh  
mm  
yeah  
or <unk> or as you say back channel versus yeah  
i know  
but i think from a point of view of a person using the device you know a t. v. is something they see and something they hear  
probably more towards three than two  
yeah  
just to say quickly uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required  
so you have to do f. f. t. because otherwise  
well you can <oos> right  
right  
<unk> computers could be a bit difficult at times but  
yeah  
okay  
so if you had some <unk> data that you could maybe use i don't know  
but uh uh uh shouldn't make it clearer before on the on the on what uh i i will write  
yeah yeah i agree  
yeah  
but at this point in time i think you're right that uh shall we make it just a t. v.  
uh okay  
of course  
yeah  
yeah  
mm  
um  
mm  
yeah yeah yeah  
right  
in the middle perhaps  
modern day uh remotes have too much buttons i think  
so this is a little bit like the <oos> mm exchange of information uh for the knowledge  
oh yeah  
you guys can  
we can afford to get rid of it  
oh okay  
highly  
yeah  
okay  
i'm sorry could you those were um  
but i don't think information uh <unk> i don't think you need it on a display  
yeah  
hmm  
um for this that should be green as well  
yeah  
so  
what's there to talk about for today  
okay  
who wants t. f. t.  
you have the uh oh let me thing of what this was  
so next time we should have a fight  
that's what the report says yeah  
yeah  
and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match <unk> operating <unk>  
alright  
this is uh very nice  
i'd say three  
um the identification of the components uh and uh since since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects  
yeah  
is it on there  
yeah i'll be working on the search i think  
batteries  
<unk> um presumably there's clay somewhere  
excellent  
yeah  
and he backs up anyway  
but we need to go for uh rubber push buttons  
okay  
yep  
i think it would be certainly more than one word and  
i i  
but if we have very very good user interface  
do we get to see that  
you're  
yeah mm  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
eighty word which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement like eighty to hundred word  
yes  
just try  
you mean using that uh c. d. m. a.  
so so  
uh right that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in project documents  
yeah okay  
um you know cut cost within the  
v.  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah there you go  
you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something  
yeah  
so my findings  
okay  
strange  
alright um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all so  
uh <unk> it was it was meant i think they they chose that lecture <oos> possibly with the idea that it would be good for collecting data  
and this is something new this is something different something fresh  
i think  
so yeah i wanna close down  
i will have to check but if it's five minutes videos it's like done in yeah quickly  
okay  
yeah just so so if you just send them a general thing saying the linguistics <oos> having this conference and would like to invite post graduates from the informatics  
so so i have it now back at least partially  
yeah  
okay next one  
come on  
'kay  
um  
but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work  
but uh yeah  
so plastic yes titanium yes but this will of course influence the form  
you wanted to do it it's something you some way you uh i mean it seems to be something that is interesting to you  
so just to <unk> people want stuff that's cool that's that looks like it's cool  
um okay i've had everything i guess on the front  
so we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements and then  
mm  
the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the <unk> of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb  
okay  
'cause you can see both the slight depression and the lyman limit  
right  
yeah  
ah  
yeah  
you know a lot of d. v. d. players have some tricky settings with  
um so if we uh go through them  
if it's under uh twelve and half euro then it's uh <unk> uh okay  
a two yeah  
um the second is the technical functional design um what effect should the remote have  
yeah  
because les atlas is doing a lot of work on coding in this domain  
the the the arrows  
i <unk> i'm fine with that  
i'm afraid yeah  
'cause we have about six six seven features in that alone  
the phillips remote uh costs more  
fashion into electronic  
<unk> you have you have done the first two  
yeah  
right thanks  
what is that  
i don't know what exactly they are  
mm-hmm  
mm <unk>  
yeah right go and sell it  
<unk>  
oh right okay  
yeah i i could use another a different approach though  
um so let's just  
yeah because it doesn't have a cord like <unk> do  
anything else to add or  
to be honest we have the <unk> we have the design in house  
so you have time this afternoon  
but you average that over lots of documents  
yeah  
yeah i think we need it all  
okay  
yeah that's that's solved now  
yeah  
loss and <oos> of um remotes how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home  
it's for sending a message um typically um via infrared  
that's okay  
so let's go  
yeah yeah  
yes  
what what  
no  
okay  
no first uh  
so give them something like give them something like ten days or whatever to get the title in  
which is a <unk> which is a technique to <unk> different device  
mm-hmm  
so i'll i'll look at it  
yeah i think i in the same way that you can point to  
yeah  
pieces everywhere  
i think it's more <unk> is <unk> maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works  
they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you  
uh yeah  
seventy five percent of them  
but  
to make it make a noise or something but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon  
probably  
okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead  
mm  
okay so  
you see like it takes a fraction of a segment to display but probably too much to update it to completely repaint the whole thing every second  
okay um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project  
<unk> one to ten ten to twelve uh ten to <unk> uh twenty  
so i think as everybody knows uh i'm the uh industrial designer  
about  
mm uh i think in in essence  
yes  
i think <unk> if it was just the <oos> then th i mean something i've found with uh <unk> <unk> with say <unk> trying to find uh a cordless phone or a <unk> mobile  
oh yes  
twenty six  
but uh what would be different from this from the others  
and and new i new ideas found was the the other thing  
maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh  
yeah  
okay  
true  
but you're the marketing man  
that's a very valid point  
and you sort of you you  
oh we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is <unk> yeah one and a half centimetres  
okay let's do case  
nine  
we all know each other's names  
they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing  
hmm  
i can see uh there is another programme that can see  
yeah  
but something for us to consider also just the <oos> that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use  
hmm  
no no  
know basic functions uh it's very important to find something like this  
oh sorry  
yeah there might be multiple triangles that you've broke and you won't know which one they're planning on using it for  
your judgement it's is biased  
anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room so nobody can find them  
yeah but do we really want do display them separately because the user won't okay for now for our <unk> okay  
she even is <unk> it was <oos> in the time right so you have <unk> just use it  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
um i don't know what an l. c. d. screen is  
yeah sure  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
so if you have questions  
yeah that's what i thought as well that you that probably the the topic segment level is the most um informative for the words  
yeah i mean if you  
and most of the times there is a brand present on it  
and if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection you have the <unk> two most important functions in one uh button  
we for utterances as well  
so  
i i think it's it's uh  
so that's one option  
well  
that's cool  
okay  
so it it handled that fine  
well they don't own <unk> anyway do they  
so  
so  
mark up  
what actually is it supposed to do what do people pick up the remote and use it for  
and um yeah a straight design pretty much  
can can we save this or  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
four point five euros which is an awful lot so that could well be wrong  
yeah  
yeah i had  
yeah yeah some of them  
yeah  
because that's the <unk> the situation it is right now  
yeah we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it but with only four people it doesn't really make sense  
yeah that's me  
but what we're  
yeah  
so  
right  
alright  
i it's not possible yeah  
it at the moment there are <unk> uh there are two i think two small ones and two large triangles  
okay  
giraffe  
and now it's not  
lost  
so there is more and more <unk> uh frequency components let's say or something like that in one broad band  
uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting  
yeah  
that'd be okay  
but first i will uh tell you something about the tools we have here  
yeah  
they would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other  
yeah  
oh yeah that's true  
uh not really meant to touch those microphones  
yep  
yeah yeah  
okay  
like plastic with rubber kind of on top  
just one to the next door yeah  
but the various integrated circuit options are we have either a simple one  
but if you give true to a negative question  
so you also have a value which can be tied down to a time  
square one  
it's here  
mm-hmm  
if we wanna  
and this is what everybody sort of <oos> the problem was solved with years ago  
good point  
um save  
do we know what the other ones are  
the v. appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a v. like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface  
um have you been talking to matthew about what you've been doing  
like it could be pretty much any colour we want  
yeah yeah  
well it looks really professional  
anyway  
we didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though  
okay  
weeks  
watching t. v. then that's the least of your problems but you know it's up there  
so you have this  
well  
um  
<unk> update you say  
okay well i can send it to all of you  
easily yeah yeah  
voice um recognition thing  
so we'll leave that one for now  
well the beginning of the  
okay um  
instead of saying volume like a little speaker or something  
um that is um here at the list of utterances it um gets us for the first meeting  
okay  
alright i've done some research for functional requirements  
uh  
huh hi name  
no  
yeah yeah yeah  
but the  
the remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you <unk> who haven't seen a remote control uh inside  
what exactly is a smart chip  
mm-hmm  
maybe they are using p. l. p. <unk> and but i th i believe that there is still some stuff up to yeah  
so if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes  
that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking  
yeah  
decrease in <unk> the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important the smaller here  
or you can just  
ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit  
okay  
uh craig do you wanna  
alright  
okay  
oh really  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
it's gonna be on this landmark  
mm-hmm  
yeah i think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material  
yeah so it's  
to private rooms  
<unk>  
uh  
normal colour and the the joystick away and put the button up button down right left  
but i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour  
okay that would be kinda <oos>  
yeah but it was  
so for this utterance the next utterance if it's from another pa uh speaker  
um  
open  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
and i think uh especially colour l. c. d. which is indeed pretty trendy  
okay  
okay  
mm  
um the trend watching  
so maybe maybe a two  
it's near <unk> sort of it's it's near the <unk> <oos> side of england i guess  
and i hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly  
yeah  
um  
the molds are <unk> just taken out of the the file that generate that <oos> the parts  
two two years yeah  
i <unk>  
sorry <unk> <unk> yeah if i can interrupt you  
you to take in account that your you <unk> yeah uh  
whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the l. c. d. <unk> going to incorporate do you think  
he said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference  
yes  
and so and so you say okay  
uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether  
so this is why they have make two two files  
commas did you say  
hmm  
and also any <unk> that the user might wish to incorporate  
but maybe i think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it  
but you know th  
yeah  
hmm  
but  
yeah th now this is per per unit this number of components  
like this pen doesn't really look like a pen but it makes you think oh  
mm-hmm  
which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple a regular advanced  
i can't see <unk> although th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l. c. d. technology now  
yeah  
we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about <unk> the use of l. c. d. screen on on the remote control because of costs  
keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an <unk> and stuff and uh marketing uh research  
and i um  
is that enough  
you know if you're at university you're paying your <oos> but you don't have a <oos> you don't have a life insurance policy you don't  
so so no need for an l. c. d. display  
yeah ascii file basically  
yeah i know  
um scroll buttons as well  
but you still have the problem about uh the television itself  
okay  
issue  
well <unk> you know it's this uh fruit and vegetable year  
yeah  
um you've got the l. e. d. here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board  
yeah we we received an email about this uh <unk> designs  
no we basically  
i mean it's more or less the same approach right  
well you just it's one extra button  
it's it's not a practical i mean it's it's alright for a table but for a remote control you know  
ugly  
hmm  
okay  
oh  
yeah it's just the way they wired it  
yeah  
um it's very cute and we could probably change it to yellow bright yellow for like a the for the company logo  
i would i would guess so  
uh uh uh  
an absorption feature  
the i mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper  
'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers like an interactive programme guide  
uh no i wouldn't want to throw out  
oh that <unk> just be a little add on  
we need <unk> r. f. to beep  
uh still we need to <unk>  
fine  
i try to <unk> it by these three  
maybe  
yeah  
okay  
um up volume yeah i would have thought so  
should  
what i don't know what the j. means  
marketing  
uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand  
which one would you prefer  
yeah i know what you mean kind of like a  
yes  
mm-hmm  
usually  
no  
star burst nuclei  
do <unk> you know the requirements for the remote control  
opinion  
yeah  
so maybe first i will just describe the ma the smart meeting room that we have at <unk>  
okay  
we decided on the component  
mm-hmm  
turn off the t. v.  
so that's that  
so that's eleven point seven and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements  
mm  
you know that's the problem for speech coding  
huge things  
uh yeah  
you you ca you <unk> so you don't die of <oos>  
you yeah  
yeah  
and <unk> because i don't think this is so difficult now you have um already looked at the histograms and open c. v. computing distances and so on  
yep  
mm  
yes  
guess i should probably try to sit up straight  
so we could even add something  
mm  
although  
yeah so it's th the functional design stage is next i guess  
so i got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well at the end  
oh number two sorry  
crappy  
uh  
that's nice  
i just wanna say plastic  
mm  
but you don't wanna  
yeah  
we're finished  
if we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a <oos> or something like that  
um so that shouldn't be in but radio loud <unk> is a thing  
yeah  
yeah okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um uh yeah  
now you need the different method from how from <unk> you can generate the <unk>  
and you keep losing them  
no  
eight  
what  
you can you are  
okay  
thank you  
um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control yeah mm-hmm  
has to be simple enough to  
edinburgh  
so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and <unk> you know something fashionable  
spongy  
hmm  
yeah  
but um  
um would you think it would make sense to just take um file files by speaker  
mm  
put the actual location  
yes  
yes  
i mean again that's the pair of you  
uh that that's  
oh  
yep  
i'll give it a three  
oh we're gonna have a prototype presentation first  
so will become eight soon  
what  
well that's for example with uh we submitted a project with <unk> jean marc um to use that thing as meta data  
and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off  
yeah i can find uh  
oh  
what are we going to do  
the television as we as we all know it with with <oos> signals and you can't go back uh-huh  
ah okay okay  
how do you know what's going on here  
or the  
<unk>  
some sort of like  
so you would you're doing i you're doing a word by word base  
i mean uh <unk> uh there's no way of getting around that  
so mm  
five to ten  
okay  
we'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all  
it's like five 'cause there's one in the middle  
mm  
i like that idea  
okay well that's good because for the dictionary the order doesn't make a difference does it  
so that eliminates all the complicated documentation okay  
can either use a hand dynamo or the kinetic type ones you know that they use in watches or else uh a solar powered one  
don't touch the remote  
yeah you just can drop it  
uh-huh  
questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven from true to false  
but i think for this price this is it's really a reasonable product  
you need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way  
category  
i'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do  
i know you were saying that you're a little bit <oos> about that i dunno  
yeah it's not  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
oh maybe i'm getting mixed up with something else but it wanted a  
and they're also good for exercise as well  
so  
no i'm good  
well i mean it if if if these similar sort of phrases or words were discussed in this meeting and were also discussed in the previous meeting  
yeah but uh it doesn't <unk> yeah it it's better to to keep it one  
'cause i think the  
yeah  
yep  
so that we don't do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech  
uh i can't just go in let them get start and then come back  
so this is what we need to have for certain  
mm-hmm  
right  
because <unk> um it means we've got well no this is three times right 'cause we've got oh no  
yeah we're in agreement everything the design is okay  
they can work from a you don't have to hold it  
so i'd i'd give it a four  
uh the second group is the older group  
trying to find out the strongest or the the most dominant peaks in the spectrum which is more or less the same  
okay  
uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point  
there's also different colours and different uh  
what date do we have to have this presented what day of the week is that and issues like that  
yeah  
is a it is a it is a  
<unk> yeah  
are able to yeah well i think that's probably back where we started at this  
so we  
and so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time  
help me  
so and i've got time today tomorrow and probably friday  
okay  
okay  
well not <unk> necessarily  
so this is more semantic uh layer  
<unk> <unk> <unk> up yeah  
it works like this  
yes but there's a cost limitation too  
so  
huh  
yeah and i mean <unk>  
and we also want it to be fashionable which i'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah  
okay  
i'm not sure i haven't really looked at the data  
i i kind of think it's it's unique enough that i'd give it a one or a two  
what is going on  
yep  
yeah  
so that it's not just parsed into this idea of which object  
so it's only gonna use quite small documents you see to start with  
but we have done work on <unk> different kinds of meetings um in terms of how highly interactive they are  
you know your information about programme that's on at the moment  
'kay  
so you got how many degree you you it  
um yeah we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations whether they be on computer or on the <unk> or whatever you want  
yes  
yeah yeah  
i have to call this in a form  
yeah  
huh  
yeah production cost  
in fact uh we we we could you know okay you know all these graphical user interface that you see uh okay  
okay  
okay  
um  
all thanks to iain for the design of that one  
but i <unk> it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
mm  
no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them  
yeah  
right  
'kay  
in some way like i in the end it'll result in one annotation  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm well for now the uh most effort was uh on uh um showing why i it's i it's it will not work  
okay  
so do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop  
okay  
yeah  
yeah they're making it uh all the time  
and so if they <oos> a lot within that they're still looking at that object  
for this one  
so we have like channel button the previous channel button the volume button plus a mute button and uh just the the traditional on off button  
it isn't practical  
a scroll wheel it <unk> uh only states that a scroll wheel requires a regular chip and that a display requires an advanced chip  
what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique  
you have another meeting soon  
uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time  
nice  
is it  
so it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily  
from from bouncing it  
that's kinda strange  
i actually didn't do that at all though every single one i a all the presentations i either added slides or <oos> 'em  
okay  
uh an electronic chip  
so  
so  
i have a question  
you <unk> you can find anything well right  
um but uh if the three disk are gone it's very difficult  
plastic rubber coat  
but that's that's not a something that you can do in the n. x. t. query language but it you can't do that in any you know  
but if you're discussing lyman alpha forest clouds they could just be discussing the physical object which we aren't marking  
so we can say two or one okay  
well <unk> the new black as well  
i could only imagine  
yes  
but i in a way we have to be uh uh special  
uh i mean th uh i think these colours are really what our young people are looking for  
yeah  
and i don't know  
no  
oh  
yeah okay i hear that  
yeah  
so now we understand and we are maybe after  
well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us  
but if we do have the voice recognition thing there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of  
so we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for  
uh-huh  
remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the t. v. would be already further away  
mm <unk> but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use  
v. c. r. music system operated ones actually and they are very specific to each other  
i'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um  
li yeah  
the l. c. d. basically is the big selling point of  
okay  
yeah sure  
mm  
this room is a bit small but but i think it's okay for us to work with  
um  
i think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time and second we actually  
you are <oos> really  
<unk> i it does nothing actually  
you pick up the the the nice remote the simple one just to put on the television nothing more  
<unk>  
you can put on yeah  
am i the only one who needs it with frequencies  
okay  
yeah okay  
and uh let's see i had to focus on the working design which you said  
i wouldn't mind  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
we took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example which i thought was pretty creative because it was never never ever listed somewhere  
but can we find out uh about uh this chips  
okay  
what we probably cannot <oos> is of course the infrared the sending device basically the infrared lamp  
you mean like hierarchical structure  
make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to <oos>  
you weren't like a a <oos> leader so that was always good  
and you could page the remote if you lose it  
you know something wooden will be like i don't know high <unk> so a special high class or you know you can have some  
if we do a voice activated locator though we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip  
so yeah mm okay  
aye  
a <oos>  
yeah  
yeah true  
what does it display  
okay uh  
yeah  
no  
yeah  
first about design uh about uh aim in the market  
uh it's fine i think  
so you know i've just uh pushed the button or i changed the channel or <unk> uh turned up the volume  
hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
where you know it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions  
well it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders  
break is over  
yeah a little  
four yeah let's put four  
okay  
oh right okay  
right so <unk> a whole bunch of <unk> from how you work out page rank uh it comes up with uh just uh an iterative algorithm  
so i think my favourite animal would be a <unk> a cat  
dunno  
but he just needs to know in advance what people need so that he can be there and and get it ready for them  
there we are  
yeah decoder  
yeah that's right  
apple apple a a <unk> quite a big one as well  
but where did you get uh that information  
of course  
oh yeah eye tracker here  
that's right  
so you can compare the phase of the microphones  
i think she said we don't need to screw it in just stick it in  
well there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already  
right i'm mobile  
a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can  
oh it's a that's not very special it's pretty  
and the l. c. d. display  
i'm gonna check that out for a second  
for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities  
well i i don't really like the board it doesn't really work great  
<unk>  
well that's cool  
okay  
'cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons  
yeah i think so  
well i did meet uh uh uh uh someone from another project of yours on wednesday evening it was  
alright  
sheep  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
hmm  
and you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it  
i like the kinetic  
yeah  
okay  
come on  
um  
yeah that's right  
i <unk> just said it that way  
filled pauses  
three i would  
yeah  
it's a one  
i don't know whether it was insured  
yep  
yeah that's a good idea  
on the one on the right down at the bottom is the mouse  
okay  
functional requirements  
okay so the interface concept um  
this one was quite easy  
a four  
<unk>  
um yeah  
well i i think it will be a yes a bit complicated to um make a speech <unk> runs on the small uh <unk>  
okay great  
electronics uh the first one is the chip  
um you can here select a pen you can draw anything you want  
so you press more once remote control goes  
exactly yeah that's a very good idea we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle uh it's called f. p. g. a. chip  
yeah yeah  
'cause it could <unk> it could it could be that <unk> it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better  
right  
this is about this is about two  
and then  
which it's the only information it has that has whatever a number for for the um weight  
oh  
no i would i would say the older the older people yeah  
mm-hmm  
so it's more like uh a <unk> it's uh uh it's uh sort of like a quite literal task that's really like finding these kind of uh these types of strings uh rather than really referring to the underlying physical reality  
it should um if you click even on one the segments of that meeting i think it should re <unk> and display that just that meeting  
i'll clear one of these things for you  
yeah  
yeah  
a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel  
hmm  
i don't know  
okay  
yeah  
<oos>  
mm  
well i'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets  
because the of the green  
like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor  
ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross  
okay  
uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle  
yeah  
it's  
no but i think what i think there is still some data which is recoverable  
that's fine  
which is just for your <unk> ninety year old grandma yeah  
just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller easy to use sophisticated and fancy  
hmm  
with sophisticated functions but with very yeah powerful  
yeah i think it will fit on the price we want <unk> twelve euros so  
okay so let's remember there's a nokia phone which changeable panels  
mm-hmm  
it's more expensive or less expensive huh  
ah  
'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing  
guess it's double curved  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah that's true  
yeah breaking the power law is something i'm not certain of  
like the week just before the presentation i have most of the stuff that i i'm doing now i'm rid of it including the <oos> and <unk>  
could be good  
mm  
yes but a big remote control probably not something which people would like  
yeah  
um because of the way that we've <unk> the number of buttons and such  
still the end conclusion  
oh  
'cause some changes in the finances have  
and they are tied in a linear way actually sorry not equal but it doesn't  
that's what we have a <oos>  
'cause this is you were using it <unk> upside down  
anybody have any questions on those minutes  
uh i say uh a five  
f. eight  
ah i cannot put it  
okay  
yeah it's a nice input but we have an  
can i pull the thing out the back of your computer  
i was not thinking of this at all before you know  
all you have to do is de register everything that's a time <oos> first before you add the stuff in  
<unk> how it works an  
alright so we're in agreement on that  
yeah  
mm  
that's safer  
and with the retriever it would be an advanced chip  
okay  
so if you find that formula that would be good  
um  
yes i did have a. b. c. and d. down here but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points  
hmm  
yeah yeah yeah sure  
that that might be easier  
okay simple  
ye yeah okay  
okay  
okay  
now do we know whether they  
that are the the basic options for a remote control  
the  
direction yeah  
<unk> <unk>  
maybe you can show it  
um to switch the television on or off maybe a standby button  
yeah  
and volume control  
i th the thing i like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it i mean for for t. t. for t. v. remote alone  
ah yeah sure  
okay i think this is  
um well i'm sure there's a spelling in the o. e. d. yeah  
and the volume <unk> only four times  
yeah <unk> well i i use a value  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
and  
what  
we can erase it but it's the button where you can switch channels  
this will be the remote right  
okay apparently fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration  
um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about  
okay  
yeah yeah  
okay  
but it it can go in the browser cache also  
um  
okay  
whether he needs to redo the same analysis because something about the data path cuts off that analysis for the eye tracker  
yeah  
it it'd probably have to be labelled mute  
because i want like kind of a uh so at first you said that okay now you did this  
mm-hmm  
um you have we could  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah what what does the market want  
yeah  
this is right  
okay  
you've been doing this too long  
so um  
i think you're going to get a lot of i mean the final say on what buttons get put we'll all talk about it  
uh  
okay  
um of um  
i think so  
yes yeah  
you just create one black triangle in the parts box and then re use that pa that triangle five times in the configuration  
mm-hmm  
the channels and or <unk>  
no  
so we can go to next  
okay  
yeah  
so there there was uh there were many other materials like wood titanium and all those things  
we'll start with an energy source  
okay  
um  
we have to try the <unk> th things  
so it's in the wrong product  
and but we are at the beginning with everything more or less  
i think i'm leaning towards the potato  
two  
ah yes  
what what's if i from from this page which have the similar so so the the criterion would be to compare those two distribution  
yeah  
uh kinetic that's when you move something then uh it gets energy  
and after all <unk> is also programming so it  
<unk> but stressful  
well i think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote  
do you see what i mean  
yeah but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check  
oh special colour for the case  
okay  
so the the so it's not the right theory 'cause the theory is the relations plus the notion of <unk>  
okay  
and it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours  
okay  
mm  
um that's one option but i think that was gonna cost a little more  
okay  
mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm  
that certainly does  
that's something we should think about  
no no the those things are again based on l. p. c. no  
and uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so  
i hope it will work  
oh yeah she's good  
or we can we can do one thing we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes  
and on the t. v. you can uh switch into the menu  
this  
yeah things so different will appeal to different people but  
mm-hmm okay  
and then yeah this is a this they are two papers in uh one is in <unk> one is in uh u. <unk>  
you you've different menu  
instead of an additional power button  
now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did <unk> leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now  
um the you you the data is of the form you have um three identification letter  
uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages individual work and a meeting  
it's all we have to leave fast  
regions  
so  
otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things  
so it's not this and that  
okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons  
yeah  
uh no  
mm-hmm  
first of all they find it very ugly  
the glow in the dark or light up won't make any difference anyway  
they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip <unk> thing where they're hidden away  
yeah that's that's right  
input  
well yeah  
hmm  
i just used the it was a mess uh i was just putting adding it together at the end there  
yep  
performance  
oh i think i killed the five  
well uh if we go to uh this fashion i we still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers  
so uh any any thoughts  
figure out the details of this thing  
um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that  
um single curved surface so that we can fold it  
yep i'm just open to being creative  
well i've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh  
command interface  
hmm  
<oos> free  
and different people are are are able to use their their mouse of their laptop to go to the to the project screen there and uh the project screen is just another windows machine that is running  
um i mean do you wanna group them into <unk> head of the snowman body of the snowman inside of the snowman is that what you're thinking  
i i mean 'cause <unk> i i i suspect there somethings like um <unk>  
but uh to have a trendy remote control we can also um make something like the nokia um mobile phones  
and they they might not be a as easy as this yeah  
but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision  
yeah from home i was able to access them  
volume up and down  
it still has to do what i what it has to do  
what's the name of it  
<unk> you you can  
we if we were all gonna stay in here all the time then having the notes up on the <unk> would've been alright  
yeah  
yeah okay you can also do that but maybe  
yeah  
yeah  
which should be easy easily reached with the thumb  
where are we  
so we have to keep that in mind  
okay  
right okay um yeah here we are  
well i think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the t. v. you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh  
but  
yep  
um basically i was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a <unk> test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use t. v. remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general t. v. remote control <oos>  
well this is the uh final detailed design meeting  
yeah  
each again  
oh dear  
and then we're going to have a big giant party apparently according to this so  
um  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
right  
hmm  
but  
mm-hmm  
uh uh uh centimetres or uh more  
right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there  
where you've only got the m. f. c. c. <unk>  
it's for the younger people  
mm  
kind of <unk> uh remote control  
what should we say  
uh a dynamo  
mm this is very representational fish  
how do you spell your name  
okay  
it didn't say much  
okay  
if an a button in in that uh  
um one  
you just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part  
mm-hmm mm  
there i'll give it seven  
uh-huh  
uh  
h. alpha detection  
that's it  
i assume  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
i think it's it's not that easy because i don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it  
mm  
mm-hmm  
i mean because they would be in the same place  
excellent  
yeah and strong  
uh  
<unk> i think we were very creative  
yeah  
is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control  
yeah  
yes  
so i'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery  
and fancy <unk> how about the the voice  
am i  
um well this is the kick off meeting for our our project  
mm-hmm  
your thumb here  
every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal  
well you might get some research  
okay  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
yeah  
oh the dog doesn't have a tail  
like a scroll but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus  
no  
mm-hmm  
so so you got uh did you write that down  
yeah  
but really uh i last lived in san <oos> i haven't lived in <oos> well i haven't lived in <oos> california since i was eighteen  
any other thoughts on that  
um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the t. v. or something  
right  
so who wants go  
i can say that well this is the situation and uh you are  
maybe is that that's nice to know  
yeah  
yeah  
um  
i think uh i think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium <oos> the casing  
right  
okay what <unk>  
mm-hmm  
um instantly the uh at one moment or uh through time or the turn taking  
email or chat or something  
i most of the things i have to write myself on the board but yeah that's it  
yeah  
oh but it it does feel all cold and <oos>  
settings  
um so i've i've got a little script for doing it  
si si simply to keep <unk> keep the unit cost down  
i think um  
just to get less buttons on the remote control to make it easier and quicker to learn  
i think that that's the main factor  
yeah just change it to um  
yeah i i understand  
uh almost every user uses it <unk> the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity  
all the requirements uh are true or very true right  
well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out  
file open  
i don't know i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable  
so so you can define if all of these things are actually <unk> by the eye tracker as to where the eye is alright  
well <unk> <unk> 'kay do you wanna say anything about um slide controls  
well  
yeah for thirty five forty minutes it is  
look at the market  
did you heard what he said  
is yes a wooden <unk> i and that's there's no wood so plastic just only i think  
yeah  
i think that's a good idea and uh and that the less important uh buttons like the the the different channels  
um okay so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can  
is i  
that's a little weird  
that's the only one we put uh in there  
so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone  
mm-hmm  
uh do you agree do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple  
okay  
is that a lot of users also said then i would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one  
no we have <unk> we have no buttons left  
uh again  
but <unk> let be careful  
yeah  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
probably not actually  
so the last uh concept is intelligent  
but uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip  
range  
i mean it's quite easily accessible  
okay  
like i don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels things like that because different televisions will have  
or  
yeah  
no  
so we can maybe see what uh what the people want  
yeah i think i agree with the single design thing for now because we're trying to do so much that if we're trying to make a unique  
yeah  
but uh  
mm-hmm  
sen oh stand by  
yeah that's true  
uh the properties of the case  
so how  
yeah uh i agree  
quasar  
uh this is true  
yeah  
push buttons instead of the wheel  
mm  
is everyone interested in that  
'cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff  
so the the you you you had a you had a thing call i think it's mould or so or something that you said which is sort of to create a new part  
doesn't save us quite as much  
um but it <unk> it's not been very popular car probably 'cause it makes um  
oh yeah i suppose so yeah  
no it's not gonna be a <unk> no <oos> but still like a source of information or source for menus  
i guess all of you have i updated info  
<unk> well if you have to look at it  
maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it  
yeah  
mm  
and basically uh  
mm-hmm  
i don't think there's anything else on the market that does that so  
at least it gives  
no i <unk> i knew  
so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
or the the the targeted group  
on the back  
so now we don't have a lot of buttons  
yeah  
it's  
it should be very fancy with <unk> and uh very handy to hold  
oh  
that would just be so cool to <unk> do all your notes and <unk>  
mm  
so these i have some results on  
ah yeah the sale man four million  
at uh the white board on the left  
if we get it on a word by word basis whatever you do it'll probably appear in a word by word basis  
second model said very definitely a french page because all of these pointed to french sites and it was only pointed to it was something dot f. r. as well  
okay  
so how to verify this  
<unk> so in essence what you would then do is  
i i hope so  
i don't it's hard to say  
mm-hmm  
yeah i yeah  
colours i think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the l. c. d. screen  
exactly  
say something like um lithium ion battery the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now  
i mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated and that p. r. t. <unk> p. r. o. t. thing is incredibly confusing  
exactly  
yeah  
they are these channel coding  
uh nowadays not that one  
it says  
just before we go through all of the steps here um well what we'll do is  
um  
yes  
hell yeah  
like you know if i'm watching t. v. i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me  
but it makes more sense for the converter between g. d. f. and n. x. t. not to add any data  
there's uh four five six categories  
mm-hmm  
yeah it's  
yeah i mean fancy was was defined by <unk> fruit and vegetable look  
just the windows are wider oh ah i see  
we don't have anything like that  
this is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here  
uh-huh  
i think that's the industrial design is the first one that's kate for the working design  
huh  
because that is a process not a  
and not too expensive  
something like that  
yeah i didn't i didn't think about that but i'd yeah  
i totally agree  
mm-hmm  
i i it's not really anything new but uh the mm they just applied that to speaker i. d.  
if i could go there with this cable  
seven being a nice round number to work to  
he doesn't have the files the real the real <unk> ones  
breathing  
if if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors  
does  
a little bit bigger yeah but  
so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah new voices like yeah  
yeah  
this is the method that uh i'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role  
or or the <unk>  
flashy  
um so maybe we need to think about having three or more <oos> of controls  
i am a big animal <oos>  
mm  
maybe that could be a little apple  
mm  
but i don't i don't think it means the room as in this room  
i think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready  
it's used only when you  
and the rest of it the under uh the under side uh of it  
if th <unk> well  
yeah  
yeah  
um the decision to make um the buttons on the top and the menu on the  
yeah i suppose mm 'kay  
hmm  
yeah so that's what i'm saying like  
you're kidding  
we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a  
ho  
and you can put this together right  
yeah the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around the buttons are on the other side  
yeah  
yes  
mm-hmm  
no  
yeah  
and that's everything it does the speech recognition  
cool  
but that had <unk> speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well so that is indeed a uh  
it's more of an indication  
four  
you turn on your t. v. you change channels you change the volume you turn the t. v. off  
so 'cause our sun is a is a t. dwarf  
we'll see  
hmm  
and and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes  
then we would mark quasar and we would mark damped lyman alpha  
few questions about a spongy remote control  
and  
oh yeah  
nine by five one point <unk> eight  
yeah that's <unk>  
the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already but it <unk> shouldn't be a problem then  
up down left right  
yeah that's true  
forty five point seven per cent say no so  
yeah  
that was that was great  
mm uh  
yeah yeah  
go down here to the uh <unk> transcription tier and select that it so that uh when you play  
it's hard to tell  
i don't think so  
'kay  
do you have some more important facts or  
um i'm gonna put the minutes i put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder if you'd like to review them  
yeah this the last phase of course so  
we cannot play uh real media okay  
so did <unk> <oos> and ben has the um the file that they this manual  
yeah  
you can make it <unk> larger  
<unk>  
do you want to present it  
'kay the third  
okay  
it's somewhere  
so you could say maybe i was wrong from deciding only due to the text that this page was about this aspect distribution  
yeah it's the form of it  
um where you manually charge up the power  
okay  
what a  
oh you oh you just have three <unk> and then they're all <unk> up with one clock  
nothing to open them  
alright  
yeah  
um the remote control should only be used for television because it's not uh <unk> uh feasible  
no but then they would a would also support that button because it's the same thing  
on the on the main buttons  
wow wow  
and it's also for the for the children it's yeah for people not sixteen years  
i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be  
mm  
yeah  
um  
oh right okay  
<unk> that's the intention there  
which also makes a base station basically obsolete  
right  
manually change channels or volume  
of course well known for their uh trend uh trends  
yes our costs are within budget  
uh l. c. d. screen as in uh touch screen  
twelve and a half euros  
are you having a v. c. r. are you having you know which input do you have  
there we go  
yeah  
there's some other options if you're a t. v. <oos> like i am like <unk> terrible television show but i happen to love it  
yeah  
yeah they are  
oh no  
but but most you would say most most of the points for us i mean would be valid  
gosh  
see it looks like homer simpson  
it was <unk> not the <unk> direct as anything else but  
you can do a very good <oos> through the number of points  
i'm not confident enough  
yes  
no can that open  
next channel previous channel  
so and after it you have to save it  
right  
yeah  
um the his information then be useful for in <unk> rainbow  
yeah  
a you have uh you have fifteen <unk>  
okay  
yeah exactly that's it uh  
um it sounds simple at first you think you just put the threshold and that's it but um the problem is uh the  
okay well  
messenger no  
thank you mister david jordan  
it's uh application dependent  
yeah without <oos> and  
would it return just the specific like it would go right to the utterance right  
raid five is twenty percent  
um you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings  
what's that  
i mean you're the designers you <unk> you can um decide what kind of um direction you wanna go in  
incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them  
or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go l. c. d.  
i thought surely you don't need that information  
alright  
it's a dog  
so what what you would do is that you would try and p. l. s. a. and and uh and use a model over that  
soft rubber  
yes  
yep  
yeah <unk> maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the <unk> <unk> common one  
oval yeah  
yes  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm <unk>  
are not supposed  
well i think all of them should have an r. r.  
yeah yeah there are  
yeah  
okay  
mm-hmm  
a bit harder  
a similar target what we'd both been <unk> you know  
there is a tool bar over here  
we've both been so badly <oos> in the past  
oh no yeah  
well uh i was expecting to get yeah though and i did did make it in time  
it's fine so  
uh for the remote  
alright  
oh right  
um most of it <oos> from the use of the l. c. d. which i think in the end accounted for about half of our <oos> because of course we required a chip as well  
to to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall  
can't work uh until january  
<unk> those little key rings have both so  
yeah  
yeah  
there was a direct bus and it took them hour and a half then  
yeah  
integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling  
this <oos> sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then <unk> changed into a infrared light which is sent to the t. v. and sort of seen by the t. v. and which uh changes the channels  
and uh and he does a funny thing where he <oos> his tail as well which is quite amusing so  
yeah one question yeah  
hi i'm genevieve  
right  
i've th i've yeah  
yeah  
as to what you know things you use  
ha  
uh yes  
the ball is probably not a good idea  
okay  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
if we said find remote locate remote or something  
so you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested  
okay  
no that's fine  
the <unk> because she's only fifty per cent working and  
okay  
e. which is <unk>  
o. <unk> <unk> o. capital o. capital k. and huge no no i don't know why she missed that in the in the guidelines  
just make through a remote as it is but make an option to insert profiles  
so maybe we can uh use the docking station for example uh m. p. three players or or uh  
yeah  
yeah  
right  
it's good  
mm-hmm  
yeah you have to put it up uh  
um  
oh yes  
and if we  
uh a third material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber  
yeah  
yeah from the t. i don't think it's enough uh  
so you are you saved your <unk> your presentation somewhere  
like we're using twenty seven phones and before it was like twenty four twenty five  
okay  
okay maybe in fifty percent uh on that  
and of course i used the web to uh find my information  
elementary  
right  
we don't have l. c. d. for it but  
where's function  
for a remote control  
right  
and they don't always talk to each other  
yeah  
it's um for example there's uh b. d. b. o. o. one c. point six  
and project manager of course  
no sorry i've uh i was wrong i was thinking it's exactly the same thing that happens when we say set select no it does not  
yeah  
you  
yeah it's it's taken out the  
i don't know really  
i mean the idea was it wasn't worth the investment right  
in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make  
i think we <unk> i think we decided that <unk> we're actually going down both routes  
chip on print  
which is not a with a not very appropriate device you you will have problems <unk> when you will get old  
um  
okay now we come to other important features that i did not tell you  
no i think i think it's better to have l. l. c. d. screen because in the area of <unk> thirty six to forty five  
okay so  
or we can send also uh what i uh was presenting in my term presentation was a h. two six four  
easy to use  
i think the <unk> is is too limited  
you can also get the kind of the t. v. guide so  
i guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy  
well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark i think because most people lost their remote control  
i'm a cat person  
yeah  
slide it in there  
um  
just a very thin <unk> sheet for a a grip <unk> thing or for  
<unk> third third third  
well then it's a useless project  
and we're a very environmentally friendly company aren't we as well  
um  
we're in  
<oos>  
we like our kitty cat and our rat and our fish but i think we all have to like each other um to get this done  
so i got that little message a lot sooner than i thought i would so  
right  
an energy source feeds an integrated circuit like a chip that can compose messages  
or does it know which one you want to use  
then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us  
um in the we asked them uh how would you like a <unk> a new feature  
to to to be slightly involved in that project to be to to respect the date  
um and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel  
the solar cells <unk> is i is it  
so  
yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh  
would the sort of spongy and the the <unk> thing <unk> you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a <unk> a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff  
uh i yeah  
functional ability  
fruit  
you mean integrate them all into the circuit board  
yeah  
oh it's not <unk> code book  
if  
is this just a television remote  
well we have decided more or less the basic structure  
okay  
alright teamwork  
yeah  
yeah but when you use two you can use it two times longer  
well uh we <unk> we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait  
no uh it's clear  
yes  
well you know which mold they come from  
so and it's available everywhere  
mm-hmm  
yeah we should do that  
so and they they admit that the the they should uh <unk> they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control  
okay  
i think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place  
you could for example if your buttons are faded  
um back to business back to the money part  
alright  
this is it but we had to do it huh because we have to have a design and that is within the budget  
right  
the banana  
menu  
that'll be something that sets it apart rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment  
um right we can probably skip that for now  
they work a lot on layout analysis  
i <unk>  
i in in the base we could like make uh a button and if you push it the remote control itself <unk> makes noise  
the simple chip is <unk> enough i i think but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval it can be uh  
yeah fine  
we have to give answers so  
mm i hadn't thought of that that's different certainly  
in this context  
so  
oh wait so maybe  
um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype and <unk> well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera  
so um  
why not  
yeah  
yeah that's what i read in one of those papers uh as well but  
and then we'd have um a score which actually which would be the same for the word in each position  
so you've also got um you've got your chip here your batteries here and some <unk> electronics  
yeah  
now i have enough cables  
fair enough  
yeah  
does have a lid or closes so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something  
but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you <oos> use it  
we can just process it all in chunks if it gets too big to load it into memory  
<unk> we've got five <unk> meetings actually which are still uh an <unk> task but they're not our domain  
yeah  
yes indeed  
hmm  
oh  
do you think  
or not  
don't save it aye  
something like that  
because one c. d. is how much  
it's short really  
so the browse function as you <unk> mentioned  
yeah  
you shouldn't on and off because that's <unk> extra  
yeah  
huh  
data  
mm  
you are okay clear  
well that could be no you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons  
i i think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind  
yes  
and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side  
i'd i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though  
yeah  
okay  
so is that when you say speaker support you mean it just has some output <oos> which which which kind of  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings  
we have a very big uh the <unk>  
if i'm talking and someone say yes yes yes from time to time it show that he's <oos>  
no it's like this i mean on the l. c. d. according to what i understand from your model is you have a joystick here  
uh-huh okay  
well alright  
mm mm  
'kay  
yeah  
i  
li <unk> afterwards but  
i re i use it quite often  
so one or two do you think  
um that it's there  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yeah that's just an i. d. or something  
so that's something we th have to keep in mind  
uh i was also looking for what you said for i got an email uh uh about uh l. c. d. in in in front of the remote control  
or else you can like <unk> yes  
you'd go to the parents of those and like just go from like the leaves <unk> towards the branch to build up things like um you know  
something else th yeah arrow  
but  
a bit over budget um  
yeah he is  
yeah yeah  
but the um it may not break  
if not okay  
ah that's the mute  
um basically so we can live up to our our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control  
you have that uh m. p. three player of nike i saw  
uh i think a new sound card sounds a better solution than <unk> about with trying to filter white noise out  
yeah different scheme yeah  
okay  
and i think it's quite important to have space for visitors because if you have no visitors or if you cannot take a new  
oh no we aren't doing that either you're right  
<unk> <unk> almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process and it yeah just takes too many time  
okay  
for speech coding you mean  
alright so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour um  
okay  
as an optional uh feature  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah okay  
wood and chrome  
otherwise  
but look at the importance of them  
hmm  
so no l. c. d.  
yeah that's too much  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
interface  
<unk> some <oos> marker  
okay  
mm-hmm  
then it's yeah  
mm-hmm  
so last time we decided to have a simple interface  
um  
um okay  
yeah but most television remote controls support other functions as well  
as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh  
yeah  
i think it's really easy to use  
they they are they are they are available in x. m. l. format or whatever the format  
we'll see  
okay  
but we don't want i don't think we want to have exposed to the user doing things like adding the threshold of which agreements we display  
that was very useful  
so i tried a little bit like um pick maybe three knobs and try to go through the three d. three d. cage to see what happens in which which kind of settings  
right now now it's my turn obviously  
i'm sorry what was that last thing that you just said  
do we take titanium smelling like fruit or do we make spongy  
yeah  
oh  
i think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions  
okay  
question number eight  
okay  
there uh th i <unk> i've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it  
mm  
and i'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the what was it  
yeah except switchboard but the switchboard also we have it but only thing is that we don't have all the data we need yeah  
ah yeah  
um so we've <oos> the touch screen and more or less ruled that out um  
um it requires a  
yeah  
alright  
so the once again the overall requirements seven to seven centimetres for the board  
which button  
so no button supplements  
yeah  
because it's it's less stuff to store probably for dave in the in the audio playing  
so it's whether to include the z. equals two in the  
we have energy source electronics case  
okay  
yeah  
is uh volume plus and minus  
no  
so today is um  
uh does anybody disagree with that  
so  
yeah  
so let's do that first i mean let's start with you can you introduce yourself  
yeah  
compression is only to really to somehow feed that uh hilbert envelope to yeah  
um  
mm-hmm  
but they want the quality they want <unk> fancy look they want some new design something new  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm  
because  
'kay  
the cost  
it's vegetable  
just play stop rewind and uh fast forward  
maybe definitely they may be using p. l. p. <unk> or you know  
yeah  
mm  
now we have lunch break  
i <unk> i think you can do it as a two step process  
well i think you can really take those papers from uh marius about f. d. l. p.  
yeah i will  
yeah it  
right  
we have twenty five minutes  
mm-hmm  
well it is just so annoying how  
yeah  
we had to remove  
okay  
mm yes  
mm-hmm  
i i don't see why not almost everybody is probably used to a console by now and all of them incorporate small <oos> on them  
here uh i store the consecutive the distance between consecutive histograms but we could uh store the matrix that's yeah  
hmm  
no the there are so many voices like again  
yeah you mean you can display some new <oos> or a new proceedings and yeah  
yeah  
well <unk> we can uh <unk> we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things  
warn you  
thanks for looking at that  
i suppose rubber is the closest to spongy yeah  
okay  
doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue like the casing  
i think with only one menu four button channel volume it should also be enough for easy to use  
um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider <unk>  
mm 'kay  
'cause i mean these these are <unk>  
<unk> exactly just like a <unk> mobile  
yes  
either stop it  
what what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy  
okay thank you janus  
mm-hmm  
i think we have only uh five minutes left  
in which case  
and we have sample speaker  
yeah but we have hardware inside which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape  
yeah  
i mean  
yeah  
what about button shape  
oh can i say <unk> yes i can  
uh gabriel  
uh so <unk> well uh firs yes  
just se sends the signal that's it  
oh  
well maybe we have okay so i industrial design  
it starts at three twenty one the next meeting  
so maybe we can put a six  
are we free to take notes uh  
i'm just wondering if he's prepared  
uh no  
um well we should find out if um generally they use poster boards if there are some poster boards that we can get <unk> of then that's  
no i think that uh soft name they were given the  
why's my screen crazy  
you have to actually transcribe the thing or watch the film further on  
you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber  
so that will uh that that that must be in it you think  
but  
i think it's the best place yeah you could also put 'em here  
or maybe we can <unk> uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others  
fancy  
okay  
is anyone is anyone providing that at the moment  
yeah  
so guillaume is working on the noise sensitive table  
and you press the uh press the button like uh <unk> people teach sign language to kids <unk> well by speaking and doing  
no okay  
so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to  
after the meeting it'll be <unk> and uh  
oh yeah  
name's jordan  
um the next <unk> <unk> you gonna give a presentation too  
objective measure well it was some those uh distances <unk> distances well edinburgh saw probably  
<unk> uh i depends whether um if we want to make this  
mm-hmm  
we have <oos> and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible  
uh every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics on blank sheets with different colours with different pen widths  
so i'll need to um hook up the <unk> again  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
the meeting is over at least  
yeah sure  
yeah yeah exactly uh he was using that  
so that that's not of any discussion i think  
more or less  
actually the <unk> stuff is for groups  
no  
'kay there we go  
you know these are the  
then there's a <unk> a second special form  
they're not using a lot of it they don't need it  
but this is this is how we're yeah exactly yeah  
thoughts anybody  
hmm  
no the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile the it should have a fancy outlook  
that to what extent people do it or not but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway  
so if i'm working <unk> if i've done a page i'm on the second page  
or you can put it in the shared folder  
uh yeah  
a re start  
yeah  
two  
yeah yeah  
yes i think it should be in  
yeah  
i'm not good very good in drawing  
<unk> for sure or maybe like  
yeah  
trying to remember it  
okay just uh in the middle the general functions like play uh  
but the the problem is that uh is it robust to <oos>  
yeah  
because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a they won't be talking into a remote i'm sure  
<unk> yeah  
to keep a simple old technology which if it works perfectly well i see no point in improving on if it works so  
okay  
yeah the buttons won't get that small when the l. c. d. screen is  
yeah  
mm 'kay  
yeah yeah yeah  
huh  
the keys might be you know funny or or or uh something for the elderly  
uh  
the box is gonna sell it i think the outside the casing  
and people running this style of algorithm the page rank style stuff generally run it on about two million or twenty million pages or whatever  
um for instance the stand by button isn't always red uh it really should be  
i just thought that it it might be <oos> more battery power if there if it is a light up  
so i just extracted the actual dialogue numbers  
okay  
and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas i mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive but  
no actually this is this is not going to <oos> actually it it's <unk> i it is <unk>  
and another thing how would you like to have a speech recognition on it  
i don't know how they do th that  
so forget this one  
so no problem  
yes  
uh next sheet  
right  
because anybody generally who writes the slides yeah  
well that's that's  
usually what we do sometimes uh okay just to say something about password <oos>  
yes it's really fruity  
i'm i'm sorry  
you have <unk> produced something about that  
mm-hmm  
and this image is i this image is output uh <unk> to the client  
i i don't i don't know the costs  
so <unk> so okay so but you just said i think that you would <unk> short turns as being the non interactive parts  
uh during the task there is a flash and a bleep  
us us user interface  
okay  
i don't know the shortcut so ah f. five  
that would be me  
oh  
yeah  
okay  
yeah me too  
uh two  
<unk> the button supplements  
yeah  
nokia has a well okay it's not really a scroll wheel  
so  
uh twenty five  
so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold  
yeah yeah  
one  
wow that's a it's definitely a strong one  
so well maybe two because of the voice recorder  
okay  
and then you just say in that time period what percentage are they looking at triangle one  
so yeah the key point here is simple  
so it doesn't actually have buttons  
that shouldn't be that hard to do right  
i'll rub that out  
well  
kinda like those kind of batteries  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
it's  
<unk>  
mine was the <unk>  
yeah  
yeah so there's a project i think called x. house or something like that that does that uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff  
and we don't like that one  
um so maybe <unk> uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda <oos>  
would you be so the more you can plan  
i think this is what we agreed to cross out before isn't it  
so <unk> all the random decisions at the end could have been <oos>  
well  
right much option on that  
i think maybe we should do it on a <unk> button itself though  
a mango  
yeah  
but what are uh uh  
there we go  
but like so make it an option which one it displays or which one it uses for the <unk> or 'cause it 'cause i was just thinking sort of so that both jasmine and vera could um see their data working and  
basically the trap  
okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah but again maybe th how do we know the t. v. can handle it  
that's true  
with the light  
hmm  
uh it between the couch and you can't find it  
that doesn't really work  
well what we'll do is <unk> we can just say uh if you want to do a talk  
yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh  
curved kind of smooth hand held makes it feel nice to hold  
whereas the actual <unk> pointing up so the function is to turn the button up  
uh we'll begin uh with the front  
uh it it doesn't matter to me  
participant  
so we need to determine what the essential functions of the <unk> of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people  
but so what you're suggesting there is they can be looking at the triangle and maybe a mouse pointer and maybe an eye at the same time  
so maybe for the summary we could do better uh key frame extraction for instance  
triple remote  
alright  
on the screen  
no  
mm no  
star bursts  
i dunno i'm just asking  
mm  
so we could the the the more complex we make it of course the more expensive  
uh a little plan on on what we're going to do  
mm-hmm  
ah ha  
mm  
and that's without doing any sort of um prediction of what the missing bands might be right  
there's the graphical user interface which <unk> the use of pictures for output and a pointing device for example a mouse for input control  
but you've also put the lounge in a a very <unk> kind of a high <oos> area where the mailboxes are the printer and the <oos>  
so there are other frustrations expressed by users  
and if it has classes for <oos> files you can do it in memory  
yeah and now you can <unk> look it over internet  
on the  
and the unusual scenario that you're not using the uh slide at all  
okay  
mm-hmm  
uh left or right  
mm okay  
which makes it easier to operate it  
so yeah pretty close to a two  
as a directory yeah yeah  
new materials  
i will close the meeting um just after that we'll have lunch break  
okay  
uh these things  
it's not yellow anymore  
grapes  
<unk>  
yeah i think it's a beautiful  
is <unk> yeah  
but  
didn't you mention the teletext just television only  
yeah sure  
what are your thoughts  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay  
so there's lots of light coming in  
yeah  
well i doubt it but  
so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly  
that's why it's uh  
um given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non remote remote  
uh building games like snake or <unk> to <oos> the younger users  
so um not seven steps seven scale  
they say if this page is good in some way and it links to this other page  
um you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach  
no then we have to sell it for thirty euros  
like when you when you buy a t. v. you just ask well i'll  
yeah i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing  
yeah  
okay yeah  
yeah  
if you can but you have to pro though i think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination  
well solar may not be so good when you're watching t. v. in the night but  
so compression basically you are looking at i guess yeah  
if it was star burst galaxies it would be in there  
up  
okay  
that's too bad  
people will wanna buy it  
yep  
yeah good idea  
um  
they say they say okay here you go  
it would be nice it would be nice to do it  
many functions but well your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this  
is that the <unk> our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken we gotta stop  
okay  
yeah  
uh  
oh i see  
obviously  
uh but <unk> <unk> <unk>  
no  
well as i said uh earlier i think the uh l. c. d. screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote  
right  
but it depends on the cost i guess  
uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button  
no raid on both they systems was the problem  
but yeah in a very broad sense i mean <unk> what you're going to investigate what kind of uh  
yeah  
yeah  
and i'm going uh to plan my holidays  
or or is white and black then two more or  
so yeah  
yeah  
yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some  
and you push a button and then you hear bleep bleep and we will find it  
<unk> are you not creating files anywhere like sort of real files  
i think  
uh <unk> we don't know  
you know to see if the <unk> channel switchboard works well enough or not  
but uh that might <unk> be some difference inter interaction par patterns  
i'm gonna buy one buy one for my <oos>  
direct <unk> 'cause we are not going to in a tree out of the ami data  
mm-hmm  
yay  
i guess that's good good for now  
so  
no no  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
sounds great  
mm-hmm  
it's a pretty simple design  
oh so sorry um  
oh well  
i know  
yeah  
so when when do you think that would be  
um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult  
mm-hmm  
and then the other one is the power  
okay  
yeah  
you have to do nothing for it  
yeah  
yeah he's really keen on that isn't he  
okay so  
right right  
do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products then or do you have to do it via the remote  
so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes  
on the same p. c. b. yeah yeah  
celebrate  
you know that we need exchange structure marked up on x. amount of data at this point is knowing um where you're headed with this i think  
it's not means it's a wrong information  
seems so silly to be writing this all  
yeah a lo the long box shape yeah  
now that was one thing that we brought up over email  
then we have the numbers  
uh and the acquisition is done in raw video  
mm-hmm  
yep  
yeah this this is not unaffordable but the problem is whether people need it whether they do have a t. v. to use its full  
no i can't even remember  
yeah well do we do this with uh this product  
yeah  
and this one comes out as well  
me too  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no but i think once you have the voice for a person  
is is goo again or is it really z. equals two  
a touch pad  
mm-hmm  
yeah another uh <unk> issue was that  
screen  
prove it yeah okay  
so it's one or two  
if you're doing it in java could you <unk> the um dictionary yeah as well as writing it to a file  
yep  
<unk>  
yeah now they're  
like this  
one  
there you go  
yeah  
patent patent patent  
like i was under the impression that we couldn't do that because we couldn't load the data for all that  
next  
i'm not sure that was what was meant but  
uh i hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah  
so uh gamma which is estimated using uh information about minimum duration of phonemes about  
it's yeah i mean the wave data are obviously not gonna get off there completely  
yeah  
things in those terms  
mm-hmm  
yeah it is put f. five  
'cause it's only intelligible theoretically  
uh maybe during the discussion uh section  
yeah okay  
not counting anything we'd still be in budget  
um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting  
fashion um conscious electronics company so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use  
thank you gentlemen  
yeah but it has it has to fit your hand  
yeah  
and the costs within the budget  
yeah  
just use  
oops  
yep  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yes right  
so it seems we'd have to do more research on it  
okay  
and uh  
but my question is i mean the <unk> speaking you kind of picture <oos> with their remote controls  
participant one at ami  
it's uh at your task bar  
mm  
uh pen and paper  
okay  
was that in the sort of fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion  
yeah there is remote control watches um but i think they're a <unk> eighties thing  
mm  
just one  
so i think what we so that's what i'm saying  
oh  
yeah  
so mm uh are are are  
yeah  
i. s. m.  
okay  
so you're having a basis station  
okay  
we finished an hour earlier  
yeah  
yeah  
um findings okay we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer  
<unk> a bit of yeah well a bit of uh design  
um i would just add something  
like it could be blue or green or yellow or like we've just limited <unk> with the just ordinary <unk> so  
yeah  
so if you slice it up by time you'd probably be able to just like attach like just some attribute of  
uh pen  
it's weird  
<oos> and roll  
no can i say something uh as project manager  
you told that earlier 'cause you could do a quick <oos> you could do a quick analysis on the g. d. f. stuff without having to before you hit before you do the dialogue analysis type stuff  
<unk> you get those ones where you can if you like whistle or make a really high <oos> noise they beep  
oh five five centimetres by ten centimetres  
yeah  
one problem  
maybe top half one bottom half the other and the third one an average that we can change the parameters for  
yeah but why don't we  
however is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering  
uh no the the i. d. of the utterance and uh the measure i think  
but this this has to stay on the table right  
the basic uh combining of all the factors  
a bit earlier  
yeah  
so you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then i will explain the the user interface th uh things  
so we've got twenty five minutes to do that that's until eleven twenty five  
so we probably won't do that  
whether it's easy to use  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
classical we stay classical in that we don't <oos> uh the wheel  
yeah mm  
okay yeah <unk> you <unk> of course you could place re re chargeable batteries  
okay  
uh <unk> the fewer buttons you have i guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need  
isn't blink a part of this  
yeah  
well shall we look into that and just get back together  
okay  
you can do it with your thumb  
i think they all work on the same <unk> principle as well <unk> like i don't actually know  
it just being good reasonable priced and solid  
uh  
just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed  
just uh put the purple uh purple on it  
okay yeah  
how does the apparatus work  
ah that's fine  
alright  
and your second question uh was about f. f. t. what can be done with f. f. t.  
uh yeah  
and uh  
yeah  
true  
so uh uh yeah  
um the first stage the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements and we will um make a specific uh specification of that  
uh maybe we can in the process we can ask for  
but uh  
and they just yeah i think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a p. d. a. would they would makes a lot of sense for a p. d. a. 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but  
so we'll discuss that later  
yeah  
oh okay  
okay  
might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it  
it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and i don't know if it would cost a lot just a few five words  
okay  
yeah  
so maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that or  
sure  
stupid <unk>  
um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control  
and you could download programs for it from uh for uh t. v. <unk> from all sort of main manufacturers  
if you ask the people maybe the the marketing people  
uh  
yeah but no  
well apart from the obvious channels channel up channel down volume  
no i'll i'll get to that  
and to slides through the projector  
two  
i start playing with this  
volume  
but  
next  
yeah but is it a double curved one or not  
okay  
uh guillaume and uh michael uh are two students that are working uh four four months to their master project  
i dunno  
so time is running let's move on  
uh yeah yeah  
yeah so this this is interesting but i <unk> i don't think we can afford to <unk> um look at this right now  
about that big  
<unk> not too much but  
the pen yeah  
so no loose  
okay i heard it  
true  
this concept is in the actual design but you should know where you would place a  
changing channel  
we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the <unk> remote control itself  
if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra red whereas i think if we're controlling the l. c. d. we definitely require a much more powerful chip  
there you go  
what type and what supplements  
i would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant  
okay  
but  
yeah <unk> one or  
go for three  
yeah  
mm does actually yeah yeah  
uh okay  
okay so the important thing here is  
yeah  
a. <unk> eye might be looking at a. <unk> mouse here  
well uh two  
oh  
okay okay  
and an uh a nice agenda  
actually no but i have to go there anyway and put a piece of paper on two machines where some stuff of mine is running on  
so  
ta da  
uh could put it at one or two i would say  
so i took these all into consideration and also i have some limitations from the boss  
although we could have made the r. <unk> better had we had five more minute  
and you again get the same signal this this this shape doing i. d. c. t.  
is this for the next meeting though  
i'm having this scale this scale so we have to do it on a board  
yeah fair enough  
they wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior  
i couldn't  
um 'cause you know it wouldn't necessarily be obvious looking at that set of codes that  
so just general thumbs up for all of us then  
yeah yeah  
th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different  
so and hynek was showing me how <unk> it is in terms of um you can take half the bands away and still get decent performance  
nice animal  
<unk> yeah  
that's true  
yeah  
change it  
this might not be  
so we still know that  
um  
hmm  
uh  
'cause <unk> otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this you know  
oh so still a little bit people  
okay  
it will be  
but but it should be uh straightforward i guess to to <oos> a basic in terms of the mean should be similar and the <unk> maybe should be similar as well  
so it's four up to four up to seven up to nine and zero <unk> zero here  
uh i'm still in my directory but i i can put it in your directory  
that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like john <oos> nice or you know if you go to <unk> or something  
<unk>  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
um maybe what we could do is <unk> th think about a concept which touches <unk> back to the on the um the colour you said company colour yellow  
it's probably can't email this to you i've just got a web page with some data on it  
some some efficient  
yeah  
uh well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the t. v. on and off  
wee <unk> version with the nice <unk> <unk> rubber  
yeah  
so that's  
moreover moreover it covers it covers all the end goals  
sorry  
we have <unk> and marianne in the same  
we weren't doing like h. two regions and stuff were we  
yeah like the volume or something  
um so it is something that people care about  
no  
uh  
is it what you say  
volume  
put into  
so let's do that quickly  
okay  
yeah  
i think rubber is nice  
so uh in meetings i uh from my uh reading of the one of the ami meetings i. s. one o. eight uh the uh the four meetings  
yeah afterwards if  
oh and the model <oos> yeah  
battery one  
yeah  
so we can already argue that uh we're squeezing in even the the professors  
um who would uh who uh provides the values for that  
so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device  
yes  
crazy objects  
maybe it's <unk> it's very simple rules but select them blindly <unk> might be odd  
is the um what can you do because presumably the um d. f. k. i. folk or somebody is gonna mark up a lot of the data with sort of tags about ontology  
um  
good in making new innovative uh things  
that can control <unk> other things  
so it's all <unk>  
alright okay  
which means maybe we should take out soft  
mm  
be careful  
indication a clear indication whether actually does it support of the discussion or not  
see there's there's one week after my <oos>  
and um you know what are the things that you expect in each  
there's a good chance the the t. f. t. screen would break or uh get damaged  
oh okay so that's the safety  
mm  
not just a p.  
uh-huh  
which i want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface  
mm  
i  
um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating  
um  
is it sliding past  
right  
it's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment  
a look at what the other company okay so uh presently i am looking what is possible to use  
not uh  
i'm not usually a very decisive person so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes  
that kind of unfortunately is too quick  
okay um this i mentioned before  
well that maybe not is the same way i was thinking  
for something else just to  
and if we're viewing like say just a small topic segment you might look at even each utterance as a small document  
we've got eleven point two  
and i think you're probably right soft component is a <unk> feature  
what do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating <unk> of the user like they have to press the buttons  
well um  
when you want an other colour on the front it doesn't match  
mm-hmm  
so i don't know uh why i should put it here  
and uh the <unk> and the question is also are there other sort of more sensible ways of doing it  
device is basically anything which we can't <unk> right  
you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen  
uh do you want a an l. c. d. with twenty five euros  
yeah alright but that's one <unk> new idea  
yeah  
was there so on the top there is volume and  
well we skip that  
yeah  
<unk> maybe we should really do this  
you know  
yeah  
do please  
<unk> repetitive strain injury  
but every  
well maybe it it it is but it doesn't look strong  
if you look at your monitor  
thank you for everyone's help with that  
well yeah  
someone's gonna find some of those  
for example  
hi everybody and welcome to our kick off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing  
that is very well we have to choose whether the students it's too it'd be stupid  
products in in one person's house  
so maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard  
i see mm-hmm  
no  
and also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on  
but normally with uh it will just uh <unk> stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture  
um  
uh four  
<unk> okay and so on okay  
i would just say triple r. <unk> triple r.  
yeah  
uh uh we had that in in other countries  
no that's for the next phase  
wow  
just to do research into both <unk> what it costs and what it takes for space  
oh you skipped one uh  
mm  
i think there's gonna be a lot of those which makes life simpler  
well the snail doesn't have legs  
or or value yeah  
and one was in the a. s. r. u.  
oh that's <unk> that already exists okay okay  
hmm  
just go to explorer  
our corporate colour and slogan must be used  
then the chip on print is still kind of we could have either or  
yeah  
oh well uh i've seen it done before  
how shall we do the logo in black or not  
yeah  
i do  
i mean to certain <oos>  
broader lines i think  
on my <unk> presentation but um uh the relevant buttons are the power the channel selection and the volume selection  
we could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball  
if i promise now that you'll get something where you can put your own data and that's sort of <oos> a bit <oos>  
um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage i need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage i will be responsible for the <unk> <unk> for the user interface design  
yeah i guess so too  
yeah  
okay  
or  
that's your job  
and  
okay  
well look on your  
yeah an l. c. d. it tells a lot about uh  
wa i mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like  
well ho it  
yes  
we've had more time to prepare over this side so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets  
mm-hmm  
yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition  
yeah  
okay  
yeah  
so we we have we load into memory for the whole series of meetings just the utterances and <oos> for the utterances and some information probably that says  
whereas the rest would be hard plastic  
i th i th i think <unk> we just go for this one and that that now twelve euros is the  
maybe if the um if it was just kind of a more of a rubber coating which was on to a case  
they cost us all the same  
no worry  
we're gonna average them  
it can be done in the programme 'cause then we can um because what we could do is have a slide bar where we can adjust this value  
um  
mm  
it's really easy  
mm-hmm  
we can put that in as another track  
okay  
um  
ish  
and of course then there is the phase  
i guess we'll give it maximum points in everything  
yeah  
oh yeah you said that  
yeah we could always change this if we think we're right rather than going back through and  
the first sheet  
i think they're the same  
alright  
um  
yeah that one  
yeah  
okay we're gonna get to know each other a little bit  
or maybe it's  
there we go  
yeah  
but it'll need to be calculated at word level though because otherwise there won't be enough occurrences of the terms to make any meaningful sense  
okay  
sorry  
yeah  
that's for sure  
thirteen twenty  
interface  
that is another  
uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings mono stereo uh pitch bass  
that's conceptual yes  
there will be different <unk> icons they can just click <unk> okay whatever they wa  
works pretty well  
i haven't as yet no  
i wouldn't have that  
if you know what i mean up like one unit if you see what i mean  
oh right  
uh-huh  
okay  
that that then then then it becomes too much i think  
so if you have uh a trendy half with all red uh yellow and something  
uh it's better  
yeah  
like raised  
per unit yeah  
like a phone  
whether you do it by hand or machine it's pretty much the same accuracy right  
yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons  
yeah  
well  
yes <unk> because this one i was uh  
we might actually have to go into the rooms and get things ready  
because that was very important huh  
okay  
well i say three  
we have a couple new requirements that i was just <unk> mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this  
what do we want guys  
do you have a turtle pet  
yeah <unk>  
to see uh yeah uh  
you'd yes you can  
well it will be your jobs to catch all of these things  
um we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy um a completely new style so that  
go danny go danny  
yes  
no  
nor weak emission then  
we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things so we've we're keeping the costs down  
mm  
or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use  
who knows maybe it's possible to use it somehow but then there is uh information about temporal information is somehow included in such yeah  
but i think the key is to get the early adopters people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be  
yeah  
i like it  
mm mm yeah  
like an l. c. d. screen  
but the <unk> everybody has features in temp only most of the time all the c. t. s. features or c. t. s. <unk> files so  
yeah  
it might do us out of a job  
because uh  
there's one  
oh  
actually i think i cannot go with uh  
mm  
um well th uh that's my second point  
but if it's it's larger then you want to grab it  
yeah  
why don't we take one person three months six months four months that directly advised by olivier and uh and we can speed up  
and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting  
you know <unk> but there are some algorithms which were quite uh  
and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market  
it's ergonomic but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing yeah  
oh yeah they've got clips  
so it's six  
it depends on the position i think  
yeah we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button because when you push it and you <unk> it won't just <unk> uh makes possible to <unk>  
means we can have depending on the cost how much we can afford we can have different kind of interfaces  
one for sound card and one for non sound card machines to test it on  
there would be like a little like on yeah  
well  
two  
however  
it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour or something like that  
so we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing  
it looks like  
mm-hmm  
means at <unk> yeah that part is less uh scary  
he's uh when i put it in is is going to beep beep beep  
yeah  
so the remote control is still something you keep <unk> near yourself  
you can make it like  
that would bring a bad name bad uh <oos> for our company  
yeah  
<unk> <unk> yeah yeah  
okay  
time aligned  
<unk> presumably if they're suggesting it then we could use it  
in the a. a. l. <oos> it's a <unk> yeah that doesn't count  
okay  
changing the channels  
which is the what we were talking about this was is the device to <unk> the signals the input  
let's say i mean could be anything  
nah um <unk> no i don't think so  
we have functional design conceptual design and detail design  
yeah  
yeah  
hmm  
uh mm  
so this is things we must not do  
yeah actually yeah  
i <unk> what about adding the this word spotting keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down  
not difficult at all  
so are we supposed to bring the little things for the  
i don't know  
<unk> <unk> especially if you buy a a not big product d. v. d. player say usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the yeah  
sorry  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
alright thank you very much  
she just said that hopefully by the next meeting she would be bringing someone else or someone else would be coming instead of her remember  
ah  
mm  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
if you use the curved case uh a curved case double curved then you  
yeah yeah you can listen festival  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
yeah but i'm i'm still worried  
but yeah  
okay  
oh can i ask something  
that can be the <unk>  
so i i propose that you go to the <unk> and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where <oos> go banana and uh uh extra <unk> <unk> such as wheels  
yep  
yeah  
nah  
so <unk> uh all i'm i'm doing is kind of worrying out loud about all the things that will happen that we'll miss by th a simple view of for example regions and looking at at triangle one  
yeah  
there wasn't much more to say about that just rambling  
two of the button yeah  
um  
oh good point  
so i don't think that's the issue  
there's um on and off um volume and channel and skip to certain channels with the numbers  
we can really can do the docking thing uh it's not yeah uh we can do it but it's would be a easy way out  
we say everything with that  
that is uh it's a new feature next to <unk> to um disable all <unk> devices  
yeah  
it's uh it's uh it's yellow  
mac <unk> something which is i'd have to say very high tech  
no the yeah  
like this and then yeah you know what the shit has to do now  
but let's see titanium would give us only one curve  
but that does cover a very large section of the people out there  
you know like this blink and the gaze and whatever else  
it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment  
and they can feel when a <oos> got problems so  
yeah it's gonna be more than just the biggest case definitely  
yep  
you then come back  
um let's see  
oh  
yeah like this colour this colour  
ish  
yeah okay  
'cause that'd be pretty useful  
it could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it <unk> got like a base that sits there all the time  
no no  
yeah  
speech coding  
well we don't have the right colour clay anyway  
the spider has a spider lives in a web  
yeah it  
mm  
so this is possible to make for these videos  
'kay shall we take a quick look at the current <unk>  
i think and uh what else  
yeah  
the <unk> the obsolete uh details  
you can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well  
um  
yeah  
um um like i'm just thinking bright colours  
yeah  
but hi but it's only got one input right  
that's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys and i always do anyway  
now that  
the battery  
thirty minutes  
i think as you know something uh some devices like this  
and responds to you and  
yep  
yeah one series has the um same three starting letters  
google  
this <oos> be fun  
ah  
you when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros i was wondering how you came up with that figure  
uh i think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them  
um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want  
i can say it's a long one  
yeah  
and uh yeah that means we can do the on line changes which which cannot be done now actually  
these guys are growing up  
or was it's a wave length region  
okay <unk>  
okay  
oh up here  
i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l. c. d. into the remote control as well  
yeah  
we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh how do you call it  
oh so yeah i suggested you do that in x. fig  
so i don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic  
okay  
do people still use <unk>  
okay  
okay project finance selling price twenty five euros profit aim fifty million euros  
useless uh  
one of the four  
right  
uh <unk> that would be done uh in like in common software that we have uh afterwards  
but it was regarded to speech recognition somehow  
i think this is the easiest  
okay  
when when is she sending somebody  
is a whole word  
yeah  
uh  
okay  
yeah  
yeah  
never close your laptop  
with a  
we are here  
um <unk> maybe give him some help figuring out what publications he's gonna um get out of this and for us to make sure that it fits into the overall project  
i don't i don't think so  
yeah  
'cause 'cause 'cause  
alright  
yeah  
yeah <unk> yeah  
so these are just a few ideas  
what is a hand powered dynamo  
the user interface uh uh <unk> uh manager will work on the user interface device  
okay  
well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so i think at at most  
product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using <unk> clay  
i drew fish i like fish because uh you know their whole water <oos> system thing  
we needed some of these kind of young <unk> to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they  
uh teletext buttons and volume buttons  
h. beta should be in  
so i'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings and sort of but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate entity  
uh this one doesn't want to be moved i think  
oh it's that <unk> again always late  
you talking about concave curves  
so uh well and um hold on before we get go any further  
um so in closing i haven't got my five minutes to go  
i'll give a two  
it <unk> it should be there the manual  
because you're just doing on uh your uh yeah  
it's uh ah let's see  
i think i added a slide one time  
yeah uh the the uh or or <unk>  
and on here  
sure we can discuss that maybe after the next one  
yes but there are there are  
uh everything is going <unk> ergonomic you know  
any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls  
the one <unk> gonna be <unk> out of a piece of <unk> uh of rubber isn't it  
i think we should if it's um possible uh one with colours but  
is it yellow and blue  
but yeah but not but not stored on the hard disk and then loaded in but loaded in directly from memory  
i don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore  
but but here you can you you say given a random page of p. u. which of those two model is more likely to to to to to say for example that <unk> the page of p. l. which is the most similar  
good morning  
yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that  
it's not gonna be a huge universal remote  
yeah that's that's me  
okay  
<unk> most no most of the time it's not being used  
seven is  
we're also gonna be having posters aren't we  
not the other one  
so this  
so we're gonna work here  
okay  
volume  
a p. file of it  
i think wood i i i can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote it's just anti technology really you know  
yeah  
yeah  
it's a little bit noisy but people sort of get used to it and admittedly it's mostly assistants that are stuck in rooms like that  
some <unk> either two or four  
yeah  
you <unk> you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project  
hey that one i like  
so there is the idea is having a sliding window  
yeah that's okay  
and you can change the  
uh little more  
th that's that's back to uh tim's day  
right  
so they keep it they don't take it back  
so so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user  
we have for the search function  
yeah  
um  
i'm still not quite sure we've established that  
and without l. c. d.  
mm-hmm  
<oos>  
um 'cause uh it seems to me that you are not definite on the geometry right  
right  
if you've got a small t. v. and you're sitting on the other side of a room it's hard to read the little text that comes up  
uh you think  
'kay  
yeah well you know  
and then you can keep the curve  
mm  
hmm  
so this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers  
so th the problem is you want you wanted to construct some models in it for your experiment but you were hoping to get some from <unk>  
and if we're making back lit buttons period  
<unk> twenty to forty yes that's  
he thinks it's better to put the l. c. d. at the bottom and i think it's better at the top  
uh yeah  
the  
well uh p. l. p. <unk> i think th they should be first <oos> then <unk> and if by the end of week we could have <unk>  
okay  
but how do we know how much uh i mean how much do we have per how much  
you can say fifty and fifty it's okay so  
in all in front of you uh you see uh the uh  
uh mine needs also this  
absolutely  
it is pitch  
so it shouldn't be a problem should it  
we'll see  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
like an a. g. an active galaxy is just a galaxy with an a. g. n. in it  
well  
yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside so where the buttons would stay the same  
well i think that this should be standard  
so um do i think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting would you say  
yeah  
we need point three  
yeah so we should work together on that because i need a dictionary as well  
i dunno  
uh what else did i bring with me  
and dave where what am i looking for  
yep  
yeah  
uh let's just start with the method  
yeah  
very nice dolphin  
yeah you'll have to yeah you'll have to <unk> do some research on that alright  
yeah  
i also want something that that looks cool um and that that feels good that's ergonomically designed  
okay  
i don't know what  
oh sorry  
the product  
during the weekend  
only ha has the <unk> these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash  
well uh chip on print i think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got  
well that's more  
okay  
hmm  
<unk>  
evaluation  
i uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course  
i dunno  
no when you when you're done with <unk> uh <unk> uh watching your television you have to put it  
but also it depends on that could be a good effect  
okay  
mm-hmm  
luckily as we are  
um and there isn't one is there  
the banana remote or something  
yes  
so in that in that way it is advanced  
mm  
it's on it  
yeah  
plastic or rubber  
yep  
yeah  
and i think we should lose the curve  
yeah  
yeah but i think yeah i don't know  
oh okay  
any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be <unk> hidden  
so it's it's not a big deal to to to make a new like a <unk> browser or you know video browser  
yeah that's one way of uh making it useful  
yeah  
yeah that's true  
um something cute and small  
hmm  
fully adaptable  
oh could you pass the tomato please  
can i  
so there are so we have three <unk> yeah  
i think  
so <unk> people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control  
uh i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel which  
did you get told what the company colour is or  
hey it's blue  
yep yep  
it's a little <oos> 'cause my parents have left  
i mean more more come in a package  
yeah  
but it has to look great  
so uh yeah the conceptual design  
yeah  
be be <unk> be careful it's not exactly this because for sure there are words that tend to be  
okay  
in fact having them both will if we want to have battery  
uh that mm that could be feasible i guess like  
okay but still you get only the the magnitude of your hilbert envelope  
i'll go first yeah  
yeah  
but it's not  
yeah  
well it's also about tables but the idea is if uh uh the several students come to a table with their laptops  
okay  
in interesting design  
yeah th  
for the gap  
lyman alpha forest is defined by the definition of lyman alpha forest clouds is that they have lyman alpha <oos>  
i mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that  
yeah  
right  
uh and i had some results from that but they were all on temp two so that's not important right now  
i dunno i i've been working with that and  
but if you have several layers then  
yeah but no problem to to me to cut the screen  
well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation  
because can we have l. c. d. and speech recognition with battery and it's also <unk> related to the size of the of the <unk> of the device  
um before we move on  
<unk> two lines above  
we could draw animals on the board again  
and seven being not true at all or false if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria  
yeah but that's  
it could  
it's  
no the software is again on top of mobile or like it comes with your mobile  
findings i made  
but you can you can think also at at other uh task like that  
um  
see you in a minute  
mm  
yeah i think so  
so we don't have to worry about that  
also because of the cost uh not too much buttons on it  
yeah scroll wheel push button uh  
yes  
and this is what you also have to somehow transmit or at least try to transmit in order to get  
yeah  
it's we call it a mushroom design  
uh  
but um uh displaying also a start and end times of every word  
yeah perhaps <unk> because it's wide screen or something  
channel yeah  
and hold it so <unk> what's the marketing perspective  
uh  
so just just well just  
and and a da is equivalent of spectrum  
hmm  
when you're <unk> and then it goes so if if you're like changing the volume during a movie  
it looks kinda like a person  
no  
so all those tasks craig had when it started  
<unk> so then later yeah  
mm-hmm  
so evaluation please  
then your lights would go off though  
yeah  
yeah  
so that's clear  
yes  
um i think we could go for like um maybe not a <unk> a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape  
i'd i'd keep it on  
i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally like its <unk> and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages i dunno  
uh  
um so with acquisition with acquisition systems uh the major problem the major problem is uh the <unk>  
so we still have that noise thing yeah  
um now the fruit and <unk> options either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it  
i was just gonna step on to um i wasn't  
one thing i just thought about when you were saying that  
well my favourite animal would be a monkey  
yeah we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it  
mm-hmm  
i'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros <unk> everyone will <unk> will buy it  
just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work meet  
uh it will have measures like  
i mean uh all the film are <unk> you you don't have a separation for the film for <unk> or for the project and <unk>  
it's impossible i think  
else  
party party  
or you <unk> <unk> use a you should <oos> infrared and <unk> together in one remote  
so we stick to plastic it cost nothing  
but they <unk> you know it's like the <oos> can idea that they bring a  
re real reaction dot n. l.  
it's neither a banana nor a  
then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions  
this button is like the mouse is like a joystick  
yeah  
yeah  
i  
shaped object  
ah  
yeah  
yes the the first uh the first idea of the project uh was to have um the whole table covered by <unk>  
i'm just gonna check my email  
um  
okay and then what do i press f. eight  
it's probably r. r. r. in yellow  
mm  
and even if it's not lost permanently it takes me a few minutes to find it  
yeah uh sorry  
well nice animals nice words  
one euro discount  
so it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well it can be for design of course  
so  
yeah  
so uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh i think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look  
crack on  
anyway i gotta go  
and there we are  
what we want uh out of the <unk> um the relationships between speakers here  
you got a second  
yeah marianne swedish and then <unk>  
okay  
curves  
<unk>  
so then you can transmit uh just <oos>  
and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years very much so  
is not a massive difference you know  
the 'cause they can use that better  
um okay so what about if a whole utterance is uttered while laughing  
yeah  
but for long term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a. a. batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and  
mm-hmm  
we can have a hand sorry a wind up yeah which i think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control  
cool  
<oos> titanium is  
yep  
it's not the the whole remote that changes of course  
very interesting  
no we're designing the remote control now but taking that into consideration it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy  
oh  
yeah it it is there's the it's a six you think  
excellent and what's your what's your role within the team  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
advanced chip  
yes but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
'kay  
okay  
can we hear it again  
just push it  
so is this hard wired into tim's program  
i think we're all in agreement about the triple r.  
uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote  
hooked up into one instrument basically  
okay  
it seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking  
so then uh then then then then then then  
okay  
so  
but it's still an expensive uh expensive  
true  
mm  
does  
yeah well maybe  
yep  
advanced chip  
just veneer really yeah  
yeah  
i. d. is for the industrial design yeah  
when you mentioned uh improving functions what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about  
i mean i i th i think they do try to i mean obviously the the the techniques they they choose are supposed to be less  
right  
no no it's okay  
solar  
and and then and then design the product maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy  
the display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense  
okay  
i really do  
you know they're they're doing all these things together  
yeah  
um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that  
<unk> <unk> we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're  
next we have  
we had one hundred subjects um  
oh right okay  
i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly but it looks like  
i i mean it its uh i that's an interesting idea it's like the old <oos> watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those  
okay  
okay  
now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project  
i'll leave the room and you can have another go  
yeah  
and just after that bus just after that uh signal all device will send uh the data  
yeah  
you know  
bye  
alright  
uh high tech  
they're all one digit numbers right  
can we can't we do it here  
yeah  
so it's anti r. s. i.  
come on  
but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place  
um that's very good very interesting  
mm <unk>  
so i'm not su i'm not sure how easy that would be to do  
uh square buttons  
yeah  
because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also so  
okay so yeah so we want it to be sturdy we want it to to hold up to somebody's child you know  
i think i think it's just it's just a one  
<unk> keep it clean keep it clean  
you you showed your drawing  
yep  
could you write the words uh underneath it  
like uh you worked i with these siemens people or no siemens or these daimler <unk>  
we should know how many  
let's <unk> we just want need to cover our <unk> so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time  
i mean the this geometry stuff is really tricky if you don't do the fold the boxes stuff in your head well so i can imagine  
exactly  
yeah sorry  
um we're using plastic and rubber so  
uh <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> <unk> yeah so then you're hiding a you have attended before yes  
okay  
okay  
it's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet  
yeah  
it's really interesting though  
i mean and  
yeah  
yeah  
make sure that  
uh-huh mm  
these things i borrowed from him and i changed and then i put it in my all <unk> so  
so that might be something we wanna look into  
you can  
wait can i look at that real quick  
so 'kay  
yeah  
'kay  
any new ideas found  
and uh alright good meeting  
i'm not really convinced it's so easy to use but i don't know  
it's still in progress  
um and uh <unk> in no particular order because <unk> everybody is uh just as vital to this project um i'll just go round th the table andrew  
it was a a. s. r. u. but that was a time when they weren't using very long uh uh uh <unk> uh segments  
filtering yeah  
so is it from sixteen to forty  
okay  
<unk> to to train okay  
you called the noise x. database  
what i'm trying to remember is if the people deliberately break things by moving two pieces together  
they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones  
mm  
you suggested <unk> use the likelihood and pedro came up with a really good example why that could be bad  
um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low tech rubber buttons plastic frame  
easy to use trendy  
yeah then we <unk> yeah  
and if the background is very dark blue  
yeah  
the the average on the on the packets  
i mean you see more of this than of that  
um as you may have noticed i uh  
you know  
i <unk> i guess keep it then  
rubber  
the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations  
and that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either  
but <unk>  
pretty hard to mess up  
okay  
probably trendy i think  
the second is a fancy controller  
so um i i'm assuming that we should do that now  
to the thumb  
yeah you can buy those at  
yeah it is actually  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
that would suggest the double curved <unk> probably going to be most appropriate then  
now have ten minutes to tell it  
it's gonna be easy  
yeah  
mm  
but uh what is could be relevant it's not uh almost it's not always the case with the the um  
i guess as soon as we have a framework in the <unk> in the type of the prototype where like sort of each of us can tie in their stuff and see what it <unk> how how it looks like and how it performs  
okay  
up down for channel selection and left right uh for volume  
yeah  
yep  
yeah okay  
hmm  
yes  
just count it to yeah  
and so up saving a percentage of a trial is sometimes a good i you know being able to do that is sometimes a good idea  
oh but the second one  
i wanted to to <unk> everything  
yeah  
mm mm  
hmm  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah but <unk> you know  
we can skip that whole thing  
okay well that's might be a unique selling point huh for a remote  
now the led produces an infrared beam and signals the well it's uh very simple and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the t. v. set  
uh to <unk>  
mm  
it's <unk> it's got a user interface  
it's gonna be too complicated too crowded with buttons and things  
need it back  
okay and then we are uh through the tool training i guess  
for uh all these things yeah  
no  
that being people <unk> um frustrated with losing their remotes  
not not yet  
on the content  
and our corporate colours are grey and yellow  
alright  
yeah  
yeah i see see  
i like the environmental approach  
yeah  
have a quiet place to <oos> sit they have a lot of light and  
yeah  
well i don't  
yeah  
could be uh quite a stylish uh option if you take like  
uh this is my fifty second design  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
ooh  
yeah  
yeah it's only a bit like to that side but that is that one by the way  
or not  
this would actually show the circuit diagram  
mm-hmm  
well i'm going to tell you something about functional requirements  
oh my goodness  
okay  
it will become too complex and it will increase the <unk> the price and we can't do that  
but th the main idea i wanted to <unk> i wanted to say is that um there should be a function instead of choosing the <unk> t. v. channel  
no  
okay  
is a network  
yep  
yeah  
we've done it with it is under the if it was low high or so  
and we're all off on the fourteenth of december  
yeah  
that's one way of looking at it um  
it should be easier with that  
uh turn around  
uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the <unk> uh distance of t. v. and the from t. v. there comes a a a whole bunch of light  
huh i think it was the real  
mm-hmm  
i think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the t. f. t. screen  
no  
kick it out  
so and and also because uh it is expensive  
oh sorry four million of 'em but uh  
um  
<unk> but also <unk> you write things down  
okay  
left us implications anyway  
okay this <unk> yeah  
i think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products  
yeah  
sorry yeah  
from january two thousand six i <unk>  
uh <unk> you can you can tell on on the like i think she has given her views on the basis of design  
that's new one  
okay  
yeah of course  
uh my name is not name but  
so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this  
uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another <unk> system the the t. v. or the d. v. d. player or whatever  
the  
channel change and volume buttons um in into the design then then that's fine  
of course  
and if it turns out that you think oh there's no way i can map these into penn tree bank style <unk>  
yeah  
you heard of that  
then it essentially will have a hun two hundred g. b. only stu visible data <unk> to you  
um how much do you think there were  
or  
had a <unk> background yellow and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons  
hundred million uh remotes or something  
i do i still don't think that goes in  
or or a dog  
okay so  
um well for we do have to uh decide this this meeting  
uh  
in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert  
but mostly they're all based on <unk> like mainly  
and if you see for example <unk> right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine  
in added expense  
features segmentation every label file everything is there  
hmm  
and regarding the teletext uh these are the <unk> these are the text information which you got on the televisions  
fact we have a master machine that's um  
and and the and the control <unk> in the middle  
i so i think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything so yeah  
sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds  
how it could be done  
no <unk>  
but with a little bit of fancy  
maybe if it was <oos>  
yeah that's a good one it'll stick with you  
yeah yes  
yeah and i um uh  
looking at uh already existing remotes trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there  
the the email i got said uh simple chip but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device  
um the so make sure the da the dash the hyphen whatever you call it  
yeah yeah  
because technology will have changed and you know we won't have televisions in ten years' time  
yeah and light  
mm  
no  
you mean the social target group who we wants to target  
no  
voice recognition yeah  
rigid thing or like like a banana something very soft you can open like banana or  
no  
maybe  
which is ant anti r. s. i.  
so that's where the colour buttons came from  
mm  
yeah  
fair enough fair en  
the marketing choices you know like that was a bit of a conflict  
if we want the remote to do other things like um or i guess the t. v. to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into t. v. <unk>  
but okay okay  
okay uh-huh  
oh yeah  
huh  
this  
mm-hmm  
oh yeah i don't know what that that noise was indicating  
sucks  
phase you're directly transmitting that  
i totally agree  
yeah not a problem  
like my data is coming <unk>  
i can see that  
is this part of our a <unk> or introduction to each other  
function f. eight for the um the uh  
no buttons at all  
i just uh you won't be here  
mm okay  
alpha  
you'd ha  
it would be even more oh you really like titanium  
mm  
why  
we have rubber  
yeah  
but that you just didn't talk about any sub band so far  
mm-hmm  
do we need to unplug things  
since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i <oos> of this uh remote control i think we will only concentrate on t. v. for the moment and then maybe <unk> make it more <unk> yeah  
okay  
double double curved yeah  
you're both first year  
andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh <unk> take over the entire  
right  
no you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals  
i think it's uh just to lock it in  
and uh as we agreed we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device  
here there may  
uh that's a source nine  
i will try  
yeah  
so those banana is falling  
listing bullet points on slides cause then we'd know sort of which literature you're thinking of um putting in and we could read the most important argumentative stuff  
mm-hmm  
yeah i guess we'll call that a a <unk>  
mm  
do you think  
right  
you see uh a covers which can be  
okay well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company  
that's very irritating i think  
um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds we want it to look simple  
so you need to draw them in the first place  
now i'm uh okay  
yeah that's most sensible way to do it i think  
yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up  
uh  
but  
we have to to go through the meeting  
but uh if po yeah it's demo and uh one can say you have to guess the name to but uh yeah  
yeah  
mute  
oh oh  
anything with a hyphen  
so we're 'kay  
so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote  
sorry you go  
so  
you know no  
well not ruin everything but no nah  
uh  
and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age  
there is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components  
uh and well means yeah  
no it does  
two  
okay i can imagine when  
my table for now  
is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes shoes and furniture  
yes  
um it limits our choice and squishy is hip so i'd say  
would you like to uh  
no he's it's pretty much the same  
the idea is that i've set up i've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning  
that may be one good starting point for you actually  
uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom and that way you can keep the shape <unk> for everybody  
yeah  
so joel your main basically thing is as i told you to <unk> uh when we were walking that uh that what whatever petr did  
so i mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple  
so you better start  
wow  
uh yeah i think so  
should we think about how we are actually getting this high tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're <unk> we're using to to achieve those goals  
kinetic  
standard button one  
and what about uh you brian  
oh yeah it's really creative  
dream on  
no  
for this size  
do we have any ballpark figures for that yet  
but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is they want to have an fancy look and feel  
or yeah  
because we need to start with something  
yes  
we're not trying to follow the microsoft and we don't want to the <unk>  
okay will just take regular batteries  
how about sorry  
i think we'll be okay  
uh <unk> going going through a line in  
well actually when you compress yeah all like first you compress the signal right  
of the researchers studying this  
let's have that for now then  
okay  
right  
we possibly have it but i'll just sort that out with him  
i think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour <oos>  
and uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons  
yeah i would think about colours like uh red yellow green blue just  
that's uh like but o. g. i. numbers are there like now we're little bit <unk>  
alright so we've got uh  
actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh <unk> some other design uh modifications  
uh also  
it hang hung  
we have okay  
uh when you said the the <unk> uh uh the <unk> uh the <unk> yeah  
yeah  
uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here  
i don't say it's special  
but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the <unk> to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these  
can't we take this one  
um i'd like to um hear <unk> i'd like to hear who's <unk> who's on the um from from uh catherine actually first  
hmm  
it'd be harder to press button  
and uh i just use it for the for the for the microphone and the acquisition  
yeah  
but that should that's actually that's probably the only i can say i can do this week because that should be i mean i'll do it in an inefficient way  
i mean we've we've come up with this with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already  
yeah maybe la next year it will be <oos>  
oh  
take out well eight buttons or so  
so we might lose the customer because of this  
um if you could look into what we've suggested so far the feasibility of um small transmitter  
thank you  
no i understand that  
and i will be al also uh able to uh combine different kind of uh knowledge or sources uh sources of knowledge i have  
but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field yeah  
okay  
yeah uh not really  
is is it fits in our <unk> philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh know like uh  
uh-huh  
huh  
one's the best  
yeah i it would be useful for me as well  
mm-hmm  
that's a lot of selling  
we've got a <oos> board where you can paste up articles that you think are <unk> interesting for other people but  
i mean mark up meetings with every scheme we think of  
ah yeah we could add things  
hmm  
like a tracking device  
yes  
okay that's good  
okay  
right  
i don't think that counts as a curve i think that's just a shape  
the t. v.  
it's expensive to build it so  
that's true  
okay well thank you  
um and then you can just work through it and we <unk> either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are  
this mean uh if i go <unk> on uh <unk> <unk> <unk> uh  
okay so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah  
it's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in <unk> would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation  
where did we start with price  
try to get so that's again in terms of structuring browsing structure and retrieval okay when it is a result  
mm but even like how much important data <unk> sometimes it's just m. p. threes or something so you don't really need to  
and um so  
uh yes with the um the bleep was a hardware bleep originally  
how do you tell the difference between adding a piece to this first construct and creating a second construct  
i mean are users wants to have the time on the on the remote  
and there's no way you can represent it on here  
so that um someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it  
um the large screen oh i guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think  
so  
you were always thirty nine no  
mm  
mm-hmm  
cancel  
i mean people have said over and over again that they would like to understand how a decision has <oos> right  
so what's gonna take them longer actually to decide what they're gonna do and send the title  
never met one but don't know what it is  
well maybe  
yeah  
okay  
um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that  
you can look at it for <unk> presentation  
yeah  
can't we do that with a regular chip  
it's also green or uh  
yeah  
seven seven inch t. t. f. t. screen which is good news for us since we wanted to include a display there  
four  
exactly uh i will save this into the  
thank you  
broad band <unk> is in don't include  
uh thanks  
yeah it <unk> might it might  
well that's that's also design  
uh well that kind of takes back the r. f. the r. f. remote sort of idea as well  
no no the scroll button is a different thing  
um however that's gonna cost more  
mm the buttons has to be uh solid too and the material is soft rubber  
hmm  
um there was lot of discussing that was good  
how how have we done today  
the <unk> material i think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber  
okay  
thirty minutes lunch break yeah  
so that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis  
the  
uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder  
more uh this is not a good example but we have like a box just bring the box and put it  
so this is vi okay  
but if you are in the maximum already and at this point we check simply if uh this value is alpha times the the max of the other points  
so we'll get together in about three weeks  
we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker  
nah  
hmm  
and that's it actually  
we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it  
yeah but also speeding up the <unk> and <unk>  
three so we are  
so we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel  
uh  
the button  
i don't remember  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
uh i in terms of actual recognition can of course uh help  
yeah  
yeah i believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said um the grip uh places in in the remote control  
but i in the presentation of yours there was also something about different components  
yeah  
a. l. i. m. a.  
well yeah actually i i i divided in three equal size parts which have one hundred fifty documents  
oh okay  
yeah  
looking from <unk> of some des description using clay  
mm-hmm  
true  
oh yeah i think so  
okay  
any any job like related maybe to field  
but if you would do an l. c. d. screen do we have don don't you have any buttons  
yeah but only kinetic then you gotta  
i mean as herve said i mean basically if you have to explain in four lines  
so it's kind of one and a half days work kind of to generate the new files  
yeah  
um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours  
mm-hmm  
mm  
it looks like basically less than <unk> th their stuff  
yeah  
go ahead  
there's a there's a <unk> command so that gives me one mega mother of a <unk>  
i mean that was part of it that sort of within the segment you had these sub segments and each of them had different words and whatever happened to our <oos>  
no  
what would it be for and what group would be be for  
we'll just go through the the final uh the final details  
conference  
yeah that should be a source type yeah  
um which we tried to apply to <oos> but it actually doesn't work very well for <oos> 'cause <unk> just a totally different ball game  
uh uh uh uh mm  
all the sound files all  
the microphone  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
so basically that's it  
well i i guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology  
think we all  
but i'm going to look if i've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used  
it was very productive day and  
yeah but if someone <unk> somebody else uses it in <unk> other room or something  
of of course i try to play also with that  
yeah <unk> i mean really doesn't matter  
then you have  
okay  
ah it is  
whatever  
you know you get these kinds of results and when you add that in you get these other kinds of results  
i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else  
yeah  
yeah yeah the mode switch  
mm-hmm  
it's provided me with more examples of um previously existing <unk> remote controls  
what would you think sort of if you know if if there's a certain degree of of <unk> what should be the constant  
so after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for  
voice no no voice signal  
i suggest a banana shape  
those things may have been inexpensive for all i know  
or your <unk> you should lose the l. c. d. screen probably but i think that's i think the l. c. d. screen is more worth than speech recognition  
mm-hmm  
the market range is international so it's gonna be sold world wide and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve euro fifty per remote control  
yeah i like the idea it's a good idea  
yep  
right  
we sue  
l. c. display maybe  
but yeah but uh that's okay as long as my display i was just thinking my display can't handle displaying a million different segments  
we  
i think we're we're looking for some yeah we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic t. v. functions  
oh my gosh i'm never gonna be able to draw that well  
and it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does  
and i can just give you those scores and you can do with them whatever you want  
um i downloaded some  
and  
um  
mm  
yeah it should be  
and <unk> yeah just keeping the sort of the <unk> them <unk> of them fairly simple as well  
yeah  
uh yes we have plenty at home  
but then <unk> uh might be problem  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
and then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places and half of the functions a are removed or whatever  
then it's <unk> then we're yeah  
if it's just for t. v. which is what it is at the moment  
so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that  
yeah  
<unk> what yeah  
and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories or <unk> seven  
so it is a possibility um  
okay  
mm-hmm hmm  
i'm for for one of my other things i there is now a specific <unk> page that says stuff jean has to do  
<unk> <unk> could would you care to explain it  
as well  
hmm  
yeah so we're  
right so we got five minutes more to chat about this perfect  
<unk> <unk> what is the limit  
double curved  
uh i would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting  
hmm  
sure sure  
but it's it's for the integrated button i think also  
they're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel okay  
um functional  
mm mm  
yeah  
um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things  
so it's obviously a calm place  
so since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah  
no no it it's not really sure also make suppose uh people you can't really force people to use same features  
oops  
mm-hmm  
you have enough surface  
hmm  
i mean  
well  
well  
have you  
um okay this new product we are are <unk> are going to develop um  
so once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel <unk> scroll wheel as uh  
you can see that construct appeared at that time  
not very sensible  
oh very <oos>  
okay  
right so we need one fifty off  
yeah  
i <unk> only keep uh the stuff i actually need on it and then i clean it up every you know every  
that's right  
mm  
i thought i thought it was when they said  
um that's why th it's for example time provenance dialogue act or time provenance segment or time provenance  
if you push a button it sends it immediately to to the television  
well it is  
maybe we should have like um a cut off  
well i'll give it a try  
and i'm <oos> and i'm the project leader  
work has been done on uh  
okay  
yeah  
we uh i think your point was that you you train this without <unk> first yeah  
so uh well so ultimately now the next step what is that  
so i'll show you some numbers here  
so let's say you have you have a a page which is labelled and you say okay  
push to talk and stuff like that  
so we have fancy here and we have the scale  
ah it is gonna let me log in  
so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle  
you're trying to segment your <unk> signal into like <oos> windows and then so but he was telling like this uh relationship between <unk> and and then cautious <unk> is not really obvious  
yeah you just like whatever you want to look at you just <oos> together into an x. m. l. file and that's your meeting  
yeah i think it's good  
slide acquisition yeah  
ready  
okay so just could you just list all the things that it does <unk> so i can write them in the report  
in fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and i don't think so  
mm-hmm  
so there's no redesign  
um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere  
it's not yet a standard uh development uh those so  
no the point is depending on the likelihood ratio  
new creativity  
yeah i had another uh idea about maybe parental control  
yeah he made it  
um and then we'll yeah we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it  
well uh  
yeah  
and um yep the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is  
i mean to especially if uh we need to interface new uh um yeah or for just reading  
mm  
underneath it or something  
so now uh we have a product  
well we we're gonna brainstorm about that  
how yeah how large  
okay  
yes  
which one does this plug into  
one you have  
mm  
<unk>  
<unk> yeah you could you could call it  
yeah that  
mm-hmm  
five  
yes  
yeah i think so  
you know you <unk> you click a button and it finds the frequency that  
yep  
yeah but that's really something i would always transcribe it you know for lack of better knowledge or lack of context  
yeah  
yeah  
which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new  
would that add to our costs at all i wonder  
new ideas  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control  
yeah  
oh we can we can keep the idea if you i  
if you can't find anything else just sort of make the mean of the words over the utterance  
but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that  
not maybe  
do you want the monitor  
yeah  
um alright so the way this works i'm gonna need to plug into <unk> i'll try and do it as quick as possible  
i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double curved case probably with a variety of design elements  
yeah  
there are also uh simple chips  
okay  
and when you push uh system properties uh entire list pops up with <unk> <unk> all kind of <unk> stuff you can program  
um from previous researches i've carried out on other projects um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
or  
yeah  
so we want to have a small l. c. d. screen that's special  
why that  
actually yeah that reminds me i <unk> <unk> i <unk> i won't be uh on thursday i'm gonna be over in my induction day  
so  
not too but <unk> a little because that's our aim  
yeah that's good idea  
um  
trade you  
uh sixteen plus six  
yeah  
yeah really if <unk> if you <unk> i  
it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller  
so  
what what kind of properties should it have  
you just sit there for ten minutes  
shall i rub that out actually  
and um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh matthew  
yeah  
how does it calculate that actually  
idea maybe uh is better  
i think so  
all ready to go  
um introduce yourself um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it  
okay  
you got special colour  
mm  
double curved was uh uh see uh <unk> three dimensional  
is double curved like would be like two hands kind of thing  
two maybe  
yeah yeah yeah yeah no no yeah  
it you put uh put a black front on it or something  
no no it's not that it's how to close a battery  
if we want to use the scroll wheels we need the regular version  
or if you're you're sixty years old your demands  
so as long as it's defined fine  
yeah  
people really  
so it was again ten times more demanding than c. plus plus and then  
yeah  
yeah  
or we'll get the email  
um  
yeah big and clear  
doesn't have to be used very often that's right yeah  
while they're speaking or communicating in some way the other person may or may not be looking where they're looking okay  
sorry  
no <unk>  
no  
i wa i was just worried about the total memory complexity of it  
it's probably gonna screw up a lot of our data otherwise  
mm  
yeah  
and um then we have to make some key decisions on  
but <unk> <unk> <unk>  
the the there's the provisional list of what we need on the <unk> anyway that i put it up  
sure sure i know  
you can have to scroll it straight <unk> roll it straight down for for mute  
it didn't happen in the data simply because uh uh it was not the same people <unk> uh exactly  
no i'm participant one  
because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply  
component design  
it's a squirrel and i like them because they're cute  
so we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the <unk> some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your <unk> turbo turbo uh button  
well  
you can make you can make it cheaper  
ball shaped phone  
so is mine  
that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone you might need to power other things so that's one perhaps constraint there  
uh yeah  
um and how we could like improve on the on the design  
and then  
yeah  
but well they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger  
um maybe you wanna draw onto the  
some of the phones have some of this kind of <unk> functionality  
so price of uh l. c. d. display  
okay i assume it for so we take a <unk> take a round power button right here  
so it is a little bit  
pushed for creativity  
so it should be this one plus the pink  
then  
yeah cows  
exactly  
not not very uh sim not  
and i also made a quick image 'cause i did not have that much time  
yeah  
<unk> what's definition of a segment then  
you know your job  
repeat it yeah  
yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now which you can use  
so um  
um  
yeah that's true  
hmm  
yes maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights so it will uh  
yes and you can put can clip it uh on your  
oh my  
five minutes  
uh if you have a video or something you can forward back  
we then need some way of getting back up again in the hierarchy  
you know  
so that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now is it  
i don't know why  
yes  
mm-hmm  
um  
and for the stuff that we don't have <unk> annotated write like a stupid baseline  
so congratulations <oos>  
uh it yeah it's more like uh they define  
i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role  
well guys  
yeah  
but in any case i mean the device we are doing has input channels  
yes it's not really important that we get it like nice and <unk> clean or anything like that  
i have a little r. r.  
but it probably i <unk> i suspect so because i haven't had a reply back  
yeah  
so if the if a joint event if if if it's there's joint event linked to linked to the item then you know it's become part of a construct  
look at my sad sad giraffe  
and then <unk> that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty  
so that's david andrew and craig isn't it  
okay  
because i have someone but the buttons is way  
so at at every level everyone has to be careful to really just take even at the highest level  
yeah  
yeah uh i'm not sure if we uh we because i saw something about individual actions  
huh  
don't chip on me  
if if you like this  
um and then we'll have our lunch break  
and of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive so this is an important criteria here is  
uh  
um  
'cause you can build sub <oos>  
but uh <unk> but the question is if is that result no because it's no or is it also just because there's not really enough data to be sure about anything  
but if we put that directly into the design we limit ourselves extremely  
um if people wanna grab hold of that see how it feels in your hand  
yeah  
here shortly  
h. alpha i think should be marked yeah  
being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool  
so consensus  
are you just gonna copy what they do  
yeah right  
the drawing cap capabilities are very limited  
right  
there is in the  
hmm  
no  
in a remote  
how about you <oos> a how about you <oos> up a product name  
so <unk> it's we will try to do our best and hopefully come with something very new and that  
which data  
but we could go back to the pictures of the  
yeah  
yeah  
and then  
so maybe you'd put them here  
where's the champagne  
hmm  
yeah with mi  
cool  
yeah  
alright  
well done  
um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um <unk> the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um  
okay  
c. t. i. i. o.  
well  
no  
mm  
yeah  
and ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user  
mm  
okay  
alright  
this is what look like uh looks like if you press one button so this is not the entire thing  
i think it's a <unk> of the thing and so it probably should be there  
if they're really close to each other it's gonna get <unk>  
mm-hmm  
hand dynamo  
okay  
mm  
um to find out what what you're watching even if there's <oos> you know  
yep yep  
an irrelevant button but  
mm-hmm  
i've got a bit tangled up in all this  
yeah  
here you go  
joystick uh thing  
do we have the uh the marker for the board  
you could have it for example  
okay um well we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that  
yeah okay  
um it's <oos> in a new uh type of uh  
so um this is um a. <unk> eyes right  
good marketing thoughts  
so that's it yeah  
um first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made  
twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us  
mm-hmm  
mm  
um <unk> our real expertise is in push buttons i have to say but maybe you think that's old technology  
so  
and indeed  
no but now it's bit  
no  
hmm  
yeah i <unk> well we've we've got quite a <unk> decent t. v.  
uh-huh okay  
almost all studies on language claim that language is a self contained system which will give you everything you need to know  
whereas i mean this is something which we never talk about right  
yes but what is it  
yeah <oos>  
okay  
and this represents the category  
yeah  
so it's symmetrical kind of thing whatever it is  
some would say would say i consider those two ones are completely <oos> and the other ones say they are very similar  
you thinking uh about r. s. i.  
this was my evaluation  
we can save this one  
okay uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes  
okay  
yeah  
yeah okay  
mm  
is there much more in it than he said yesterday  
users are actually zapping a lot so they're using the device <oos> that's something to take into account as well  
yeah  
so <unk> interface concept by your <oos> user interface designer  
remote  
because of this their properties are smart material  
it's true  
was that an option  
uh uh yeah  
and where is it sorry  
alright maybe <unk> should get on there and book mornings as far as the eye can see  
you're accustomed to eleven  
uh-huh  
and maybe <unk>  
i wanna thank you all for all your presentations  
oh  
if numbers they're easy but if name the channel by by name  
hmm  
yep  
um  
um one thing uh we must first agree on uh what we're going to <unk> going to make  
maybe you can <unk> have this kind of shape  
yeah yeah  
that's just 'cause they would have a blank line in it  
mm-hmm  
um do you have any idea so far  
hmm  
so to what degree do we actually know whether the two little eyes little circles are exactly in the same place or just somewhere in the same region  
now that we know what it is that we are doing  
before i uh  
if the regions i  
yeah  
shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote  
for twelve euros  
but i think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin  
okay  
yeah  
no <unk> would  
i think i think that'll be too big <unk> too big then  
right  
yeah mm-hmm  
yeah yeah that's good one yep  
wait wait  
dunno oranges  
yeah that that usually uh like here here here here  
you select twenty you select five  
we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes  
so maybe it should be for multiple devices  
but uh the uh exchange structure uh and uh yeah exchange is first uh developed in uh <oos> functional grammar along the uh uh <oos> and and <oos> work  
um don't mind  
like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television  
okay but for now if you <unk>  
oh  
um yeah i think um i think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the <unk> of it  
i could show you  
uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of  
i <unk> i don't know  
and uh what about speech recognition uh  
but you are the design team  
yeah but it doesn't have to be unbreakable because we do need to keep selling these thing  
mm-hmm  
you know some slider or not just two discrete buttons for volume but something which  
yeah something like that yes  
okay  
because if we if we average average over over a whole utterance all the words  
i used to send fifty texts a day you know and i never got repetitive strain injury from that  
okay  
here they are  
no i hadn't  
very true very true  
what do you think is it fancy  
but you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it  
who's the <unk> engineering  
yeah  
well for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it  
of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah  
so why would we not go for that  
so  
um  
this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique  
yeah  
hmm  
take some minutes uh again  
yeah  
but also on the colours the young  
yeah  
yeah it's  
yeah see through version  
but uh  
so if you want to do again another high level feature extraction again it will be problem so  
so we should first decide about shape i think  
functional is out  
and it's used on average four times an hour  
yeah but a visitor actually uh doesn't have that much paper so for instance maybe they don't need uh  
participant four  
yeah  
mm  
user interface <unk> designer yes  
okay  
not which category like i'm not i'm not <oos> together separate topic segments into categories  
yeah  
yeah  
because you know <unk> you're you're already putting together i mean this is essentially already you know these <unk> with stuff in between  
and young people were quite <oos> to this  
twelve point five  
the the long pages for example have good p. l. s. a. model without fusing links  
radio galaxies  
yeah but you don't have to press zeros  
so i just  
yeah that's right  
if we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium and uh  
mm-hmm  
oh right  
so that's <unk>  
yeah  
no we didn't  
just uh you decide that you decide that and ready  
okay  
right  
yeah  
no it's a turtle  
um i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um  
scroll wheel no  
i love cats too  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
well how much ami  
um electronics  
yeah  
because there's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have  
that's true  
i see  
it's a pineapple  
yeah  
user requirements <unk> well this one was already clear to us  
if it's necessary can you can do that  
so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um  
i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod  
and that will happen soon  
no no  
uh <unk> <unk> i uh i yeah but the <unk> sort of start and end times will give you back to that output  
print plate  
twenty five  
what else did i find  
right  
but are we going <unk> <unk> right  
mm-hmm  
uh  
or whether we even like it right and wanna do it some different way  
so it's it's not like you're out of work  
the first one which seems to be the most important one is that it has to be fancy it has to have a fancy look and feel  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
that we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off t. v. button  
but other users who are new to this device need something like that  
then the conceptual design  
which means i will make uh minutes as i did of the previous meeting  
or uh where  
right  
right  
you mean maybe you should break the wall between the <oos> room and the women's room  
i don't  
so  
yeah  
you can always take another pick  
blink  
th the feeling is natural so maybe we can stay with wood  
<unk> so it's  
but i i mean there's not all the information that is in in the <unk> corpus in there in the segments file  
you have to imagine a little bit um  
yeah true it might be the yeah yeah true  
um  
but anyway so what they did was they they <oos> this because one of the problems with l. d. a.  
because well we just added this fixation track  
yeah  
yeah and ours is quite a cheap device so i don't know how much we'll be able to put into it  
maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can  
i mean we weren't really given a lot of time or materials yeah to go about our design task  
mm  
so this means that when it's done if i go on my computer and i do the same it's not going to enter in my cache  
a big banana  
the shared folder  
yeah or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow  
like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work how they form groups  
it's better th  
no no no  
mm  
so other than yeah other than well we'll just create a hard boundary in between each one so you can see the thing  
yeah  
okay  
yes but then when when he is used to it i i it is quite easy  
okay  
we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button  
yeah okay  
broad band  
and do processing on it  
would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two  
and then it should come up  
it's pretty cool  
alright  
kept them all the same colour then we could have the voice recognition without  
it's some it's something that we cannot do then  
mm  
no they're not but they're they're they are easy to find  
yeah right  
yeah  
then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll <unk> we will guarantee it for for five years um  
yeah  
just the the company logo  
three is okay  
one  
well i think if it was not a problem of frame dropping the alignment would have been quite easy to to do  
nine divided by six  
mm no  
because sometimes you have some dissolve you could imagine they are part of of of a scene and uh so  
remote control  
yeah at least they they will know <unk> beforehand i think uh  
so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh  
but  
uh fantastic pets and very friendly  
just one  
no that's okay  
oh right the  
this remote costs nothing you know  
yeah  
mm  
mm  
mm  
we can make a plain docking station for two euros  
yeah  
they just uh  
i yeah  
so um basically i'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control  
so uh i would like just to review at the different project regarding acquisition system  
tim  
yeah rubber is kind of soft  
come on  
um  
this is the this is the thing you point to yep  
oh sorry  
<unk> aurora  
the the hmm  
um uh do you have anything else to add to that  
the most of them um  
how many people would notice that though  
yeah but it wasn't good  
the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design  
and what are the <unk> what are the people <oos> downstairs have um i you know as rules about who you hand the keys to  
um  
is that right  
yeah  
a scroll wheel  
oh  
so probably it doesn't make much of a difference  
if they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology  
right here we go  
mm uh what it's a little bit what nist is trying to do no  
exactly  
yeah  
<oos> <oos>  
mm-hmm  
and and so that would give us some ideas about you know what people want you know out of meeting records  
but anyway what also the other approach which is possible to use  
mm  
well i  
yeah but it could mess up things quite considerably  
you  
you wanna be able to put different batteries in it use it now and not in half an hour  
yes  
yeah  
then  
you know i and i think i'm envisioning more like  
you with your girlfriend or something  
there is no texture if you want to say so and this is this is not so good for the motion  
is there something after this uh meeting  
is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to <unk> changing situations in the in the meeting room  
yeah  
you have to push harder  
yeah  
okay you can't really decide  
mm  
uh-huh  
yes  
but i it's not easy on the web with h. h. t. m. l. pages to to do uh such corrections like uh video structure corrections for instance  
line width  
okay  
i can  
that'll get <unk> <unk> sufficient to claim that we had implemented some kind of zoom as well  
<unk> well this uh this tool seemed to work  
which is some measure already of how widespread this word is versus how specific <unk> to a certain segment that is  
a <unk> yeah  
yeah <unk> i think it's better to  
yeah  
yeah  
uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control on which you can see functions  
i would take a yellow remote control  
okay  
yeah  
mm  
yeah  
help me  
no  
so you might wanna be doing something else basically yeah  
we've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away that means we've got five minutes  
so saying that it works with all t. v. <unk> is equivalent to saying that it'll work with d. v. d. <unk> and other things  
yeah that's true yeah  
but then i have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and i can change the colour theoretically to match my <oos>  
um and associated again  
right  
okay  
which sub task is this little chunk of the meeting addressing and furthering in various ways right  
no  
i can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make  
well it means like  
right they're i they're independent dynamic objects  
example of children remote  
yeah  
tasks sort of put on you know sort of as part of the official agenda  
and the evaluation was  
some lightning stuff too  
'cause they're doing this with dan <unk> right  
and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon  
mm 'kay  
no really  
like large button that's what i was thinking of yeah  
um  
first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting  
concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated  
maybe you should send a support form  
further elaborate on that  
here you have microphone and then it date records your voice and then it try to <unk>  
oh it  
mm-hmm  
no that's for compression  
yeah  
okay  
okay i <unk> i'd go for plastic because i have a couple of curves in my design  
it's just annoying because i need to do that on a dice machine  
okay  
uh i uh as a posterior for uh training uh or decoding so it's uh well as you know it's a state posterior <unk> in a h. m. m.  
okay  
then i rather make it wood  
i mean the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy  
i don't  
but uh and and uh a <unk> microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that  
well uh yeah but what what about case  
yeah  
okay  
wow  
fairly sort of self explanatory  
you have <oos> and uh so there of course are differences because on the one hand you have horse but it's black  
compromise  
i mean that's clear  
and with the speaker on the there's also a speaker  
i've i've supposed to some speech coding stuff here with hynek uh but you know that little bit at least that uh based on some let's say hilbert transforms using a longer temporal context and deriving some parameters would be <unk> <unk> transmitted to a decoder and  
<unk>  
okay  
right right  
yeah okay true true  
he's sleeping through  
i'll bet first in volume maybe  
and  
you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons  
you've got  
so when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip  
oh we can we can put 'em in the same thing right  
huh  
yeah yeah yeah  
i don't know if we <unk> we want to make uh use the <unk> or here it's uh it was uh to dis it's infra only the this part about uh shot boundary detection is in french unfortunately  
and there are quite <oos> words in there but quite important words as well i think we should just <oos> the the  
uh yes  
does it vibrate when you press the buttons  
um courtney would you mind starting us off  
press  
so so yeah  
radio loud objects  
oh yeah  
no  
like all of that bottom bit  
mm-hmm  
okay  
um you asked about how to detect um activity  
uh-huh  
and  
i mean i'm just just thinking maybe  
and uh all the other parts belong to the other person  
well in the first meeting we we already were very creative  
so if you so if you have trouble finding it  
yeah  
oh yeah  
no no  
uh no it <unk> well uh uh hopefully that's not what the <unk> problem is  
yeah  
but it's also a i i if we have  
we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what i didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design  
yep  
yeah  
okay fair enough  
no i don't think so  
the last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email  
um  
i'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together because i didn't really fin uh i have a  
come up  
two thirty five supposed to finish  
i'm not so good at drawing  
huh  
mm  
alright  
mean you can go pretty far i <unk> i think with with with functions and possible uh future <unk> uh <oos> yes  
not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there  
do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget or or you know do they not matter that much  
would you be able to um put the little device anywhere  
yeah  
sure  
you can use the free we have a <oos> here at <unk> but uh the if you want to pay  
one would be audio controls one would be video controls and the other one would be a device  
i like it like that  
on the screen  
and so for my personal preferences i think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know fewer buttons  
the question is when you're rolling it how do you wanna roll it  
and then you can buy the covers  
should i uh  
me too  
come on  
no we have a locator  
yeah  
so the games uh are in it  
so you know what's the <unk> what's the <oos> results of the work on the project  
the uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design uh what it uh what it must actually do  
uh at o. p. f. l. we are uh  
okay  
don't think  
because it will definitely enhance our sales in this <unk> in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five  
did we have a rule about this  
no that's true so we shouldn't have done either of those  
mm-hmm  
otherwise i mean this but of but of course it might be easy to do a very simple software  
yes  
not not too strange  
mm  
the volume is is <unk>  
considering  
yeah i dunno  
yeah  
yeah  
and for the elderly people just plain old  
okay  
that we then use the primary colours  
okay five  
oh well <unk> remind her that there was a question about whether there <oos> be one  
yeah  
in the middle  
yeah  
it looks more  
nah that's not gonna work  
so uh maybe we can focus a little uh uh bit more on the what we have done about uh the noise sensitive table  
because then that would've defeated the purpose  
mm mm  
you can write it on beefy  
okay  
yeah  
uh-huh  
the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic  
we should assume a <unk> assume a non linguistic user  
but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um  
and also where is it  
oh yeah  
but  
okay lemme just see where i can find it  
oh no  
yeah but even especially the audio series and the that that's what he was telling like  
i would say two  
they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything they're just simple  
yeah  
oh you got a presentation sorry  
yeah  
'kay  
yeah  
and so more time uh <unk> might have improved the the quality of work is what you say  
but like <unk> for now like your segmentation is just splitting a meeting up into different blocks <unk>  
he's the boss  
oh okay  
i think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely <oos> on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different  
okay  
um audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour  
is how much do we get  
small too  
because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu  
i dunno  
okay  
and it was partly we thought the design looked better  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
covers half the keys most of the time and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys  
that's what i was thinking  
okay  
so i think that uh should be clear  
mm yeah  
i'll say five  
yeah  
well um i've noticed that uh gaming <unk> is becoming quite popular with television um when i was younger we used to <unk> play games using our cable  
it's what i'm seeing is a is a mid range cost product  
oh yeah yeah  
yeah but but then <unk> i don't know when there are new user requirements  
that is gonna cost uh yeah  
okay we'll just go back and change those  
you need to have everything in hand  
'kay  
but you have to i they're a nightmare to use  
it's fine  
but uh  
mm yep  
but well if you want to i i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control  
thank you very much  
oh wait wait wait  
<unk> you can't get it just from a spectrum  
yeah yeah  
might be a good idea  
soon as you put a part there's a construct  
in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements  
it it has to be small simple  
because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is <unk> either minus one or plus one  
okay  
hmm  
please next slide  
but um i've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda i think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side  
i mean let's let's face it it also depends on the software on the on the television  
right now it is an elk  
yeah i mean i think perhaps that's why we have but uh rated so high here  
yeah  
and that we dropped so it it can be done  
good morning  
these this is gonna take a little while  
or do we use it a text screen  
evaluation criteria  
mm  
line on its own  
oh yeah  
or the <unk>  
yeah  
forty bucks for a remote  
yeah  
and you mean the first layer would be spongy  
<unk>  
um so obviously when <oos> come on they're changing it so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down  
um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer  
so one hand has the beer so the other hand uh  
the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want  
i would give it a two still though  
it's it's all conditioned  
okay  
it's much longer than that that being two two five no  
yeah i wanna see several of them  
but i'm just going to make a very short um graphic  
yeah so i've mentioned uh uh before that meetings is a bit different from uh monologue and uh dialogues  
yeah  
so i think it's you huh  
so presumably that might be an idea to  
mm-hmm  
or titanium  
um  
i mean it or did you didn't change your mind yet  
th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh 'cause uh  
well i think compared to say just pressing buttons  
mm  
so have you gone through the meetings and looked for <unk> and responses with without a prior catalogue  
yeah you can start it you know  
that's true  
curvature is it to your liking  
mm-hmm  
what's on the next one  
and  
but um the component isn't  
but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet  
<unk> yeah yeah  
yeah  
'cause it sounds pretty expensive too  
so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration  
i have been told that we uh don't consider teletext that it's out of date now because of internet  
we have all these buttons as you can see but most of them we just need the ones in the middle  
i have to done i've i've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing  
yeah in the project folder  
sounds reasonable  
um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material  
'cause they  
uh this sounds like alexandre pas  
mm  
yeah  
otherwise we pretty much agree on uh on placing people  
so yeah  
no  
i think it's quite good price yeah  
let me just add one more thing that i couldn't say before and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition  
<unk>  
uh-huh  
hubble  
um but not the case  
oh yeah maybe you're burning but  
oh good call i missed that  
yeah  
total  
sorry about that  
it's very prominent  
um  
is is called is that  
so  
we are using those results more or less  
yeah  
uh the lowest standard is <unk> i think which is twenty four hundred the standard  
yeah but isn't it per remote that you pay  
we have uh a curved one  
and inside this this thing you can move maybe switch  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
maybe <unk> yeah  
okay  
that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do  
a small sorry  
keep it general i mean so <unk> we will be still <unk> flexible with maybe adding some functions  
alright okay  
yeah but  
oh it is a turtle  
yeah  
five years of results of some new features and some consistent results or  
i didn't get any information about that so  
did everyone get this on the speech recognition  
mm mm  
maybe it is the outside and the inside  
do we have some message there  
yeah  
'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides  
hmm  
is it zero <oos>  
mm  
no you got you  
yeah  
i think it's universal  
well we are making the chip  
uh yeah that's  
i don't really know  
yeah uh  
that's left that one  
how it fits in the palm of your hand  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
you i mean maybe that's the best approach to look at to begin with is just pretend all you have got is  
so basically the lower <unk> the lower the points the better  
would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control  
once you <unk> switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our <unk> generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech <unk> and we can also train the speech <unk> for particular user so you just yeah  
yeah i think perhaps good idea but yeah i think that that one <unk> might just be um  
so that's just my role i'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input  
<unk> anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this  
um the channel and volume and th <unk> <unk> given given that we've been told to ignore teletext  
hmm  
we have double curved  
no  
yeah  
i'd say it's about a a <unk>  
so that's fine  
ooh  
where did we find this information  
one was very clearly english words that most likely word was the and one was very clearly french words most likely words was de i think and uh  
yeah  
yeah  
do we i mean is it gonna be a multimedia control centre  
i'm attempting to do that right now  
<unk> been worse  
okay  
get back to me  
okay so finance that's done  
mm-hmm  
so like that  
so these are two models of existing remote controls  
the  
okay  
mm  
<unk> for the muting  
i think it will because i mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so  
mm  
but  
mm-hmm  
because i've bought the <unk> stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive  
would you  
i think it will be i think i  
yeah  
it's a very good idea yeah  
we must have some technological advancement in the remote control <unk> rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are  
yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify  
thanks  
uh  
it's it's not talking about specific lines  
so  
a. n. yeah d. <unk>  
that's alright  
i dunno  
so why don't i just pick up and move then  
yeah  
yeah 'cause that's very useful thing  
the v. o.  
then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are because <unk> and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it  
two  
i'm into the loop  
but uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will <unk> be a problem  
too many buttons  
oh in the l. c. d. screen  
um so yeah i'd say about four as well  
i am <oos> for losing my keys i just i guess i've just never lost the remote  
yeah  
and and th to get to back to another point sorry uh uh for cutting in but  
okay the spongy not real spongy  
we all know they've got nothing to do all day  
i have one or or two question  
oh right no  
we need a chip that works well with the user interface that isn't too complicated  
fashion  
our manager  
'kay  
um i don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is but the easiest animal i can think is is a bird  
which is quite nice  
and uh skip and skip the l. c. d. part  
yeah  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah sure  
yeah  
we get your point  
mm  
it would make sense to do that  
when you're on a certain channel you can see on the l. c. d. screen uh what <unk> are coming up or  
or a seven  
yep clunky  
that's the end of my presentation  
so what's the new question  
uh if it's a f. i of a two line strength we would definitely put it in  
yeah  
yeah  
not at the moment  
okay so  
hmm  
hold them you see you know  
maybe you should draw it very large like this  
wait on the remote itself  
and i think the fact that we're <oos> these things <oos> i feel it 'cause i wear <unk> my glasses  
and so the <oos> says use our remote  
thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group  
that whole thing  
you've already said mobile phones  
and uh simple  
so  
hmm  
uh  
yeah  
nee we we also want to make <unk> another colour  
do you think we're gonna have time  
uh we still think so  
hi  
mm-hmm  
okay  
except for the yellow of course but um i could think of a more uh attractive uh <unk> uh set of colours  
i don't know so much about <unk> channel coding like those <oos> coding stuff and you know  
um  
no uh i agree i agree  
i suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume display and stuff like that  
and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent <oos> and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels  
you get that  
it do yes  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
mm  
hmm  
i will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting  
right  
mm-hmm  
yeah i mean the dock station but but uh i think the the docking station it's gonna be a kind of a problem  
making it just an option  
oh  
for the younger it's very important  
that's true  
and yes  
then i'm doing <unk> doing uh independent processing of each frequency band  
uh  
yeah that's right  
be uh we want to be <oos> mm  
no no not not yet not yet  
okay  
right  
so saying from <unk> your slide your presentation the engineering versus the user specified remotes i think that we should go with something that's more user friendly  
that sounds quite scary  
i mean i sometimes use that  
yeah more communication between between uh that's the thing i noticed that communication is very um very important  
okay  
the case it will be the material will be rubber suppose  
should that be no comma  
yeah  
uh not yet  
there are numbers on it so uh  
and it you know so <unk> i don't like the idea that you know  
ah okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah but <unk>  
pedro pedro also  
and there was a small bit down here and in this there was uh meant to be picture in there  
i agree let's get rid of it  
huh  
the <unk> the <unk> <unk>  
sure that's interest us  
let's see that's like the  
the third one is called uh the <unk> um this is uh the smart meeting room develop at <unk> which is called the smart  
uh well yeah channel selection is obviously the most important  
so yeah i like cows  
you're very personal again  
two  
mm  
i've a basic idea  
with the remote control  
yeah the  
and we can put the price up  
then you see it makes sense that words like <oos> just like a sing if that was the only utterance then that probably scored quite well and stuff  
cool  
<unk> i i do not i do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing <unk> handing us right now  
mm-hmm  
that's nice of you  
uh-huh  
because that's the company colours but if anybody's got any other suggestions i'm quite willing to consider them as well  
yeah  
so we've covered that first category user interface concept meaning design  
it's a simple chip  
okay  
actually had a cable between it and the t. v. and big like buttons that sort of like like on a <oos> or something  
yeah  
yeah  
the light  
yeah  
um so yeah this is this  
hmm  
yeah why not not <unk> <unk> maybe nearer three  
uh uh i i i i still <oos> i also feel this concept of making it kinetic  
low bit rate  
uh yeah think so  
so if the left we have  
nobody i guess  
okay  
these pens i think are are kind of  
because at the moment we all produce the numbers for each meeting separately  
exactly  
mm 'kay  
are all the buttons easy to find  
yeah  
yeah  
that's the management  
we can do a hilbert envelope approximation with one second  
and  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
okay so we start off with a um battery <unk> uh no a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery  
i'll mark it  
mm  
thank you i think that's all for this point  
yeah yeah yeah  
um  
in in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above  
<unk> fine  
so  
temp  
it's really like uh his uh i don't know just the phonemes <oos> differently  
it's participant one  
so when when you are making it on  
hmm  
i don't know off off hand certainly  
decide on well <unk> you guys basically have to now go and  
suppose you set <unk> you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you  
so we are done  
me too  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
yes  
so when people see the the remote control they should say oh it's from real reaction and he <unk> they should <unk> the company  
deadline of two weeks for <unk>  
<unk> you should yeah  
so um the question well first of all what to control  
yeah  
so what are what are our buttons gonna be  
let's change <unk>  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm  
because the it's the people have been leaving <unk> um well people have been leaving various bits of who knows what around on them  
a phrase  
um would it also work if you placed uh the microphones at at the border of the table  
mm  
and that's  
yeah  
we could have the casing the the face plates  
and we have the sample sensor and speaker the voice recognition thing  
so you have your energy source your user interface who's controlling the chip the chip also uses the energy  
yeah  
with plastic as i understand it you can use any form  
mm  
so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet and i think we don't need lighting adaptive  
okay  
but full assembly  
so it has a wee sort of tail that you just <oos> over your wrist so it stays in position nicely  
yeah as much as as needed i think  
'cause then you've already got remote in your hand why you just gonna speak to the remote  
okay  
in that case even the slight improvements uh he gets at that point they can make the difference  
but there are other input uh lines open  
well titanium is neutral  
and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries  
yeah same here  
do you want scroll buttons in that as well  
oh have you been home yet  
oh no we could read it from the television  
thank you  
and uh  
i'll try the red pen  
was that  
so should be okay  
yeah  
well i investigate the preference more <unk> i investigate deeper the preference of the users  
but on the other hand i i don't know whether my <oos> would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new <unk> line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh <unk>  
i follow the master class for the <unk> so i think that's the that's the main issue  
okay  
because <unk> you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product  
it's it's more advanced but i'm i think you should combine it with batteries  
yeah yeah i think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but i don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so  
no no no  
i think we can have wood for example in the bottom and you know  
twenty kilo bits also is okay  
if i if i need so  
okay  
no but this is <unk> disadvantage  
certainly could  
mm 'kay  
yeah  
so i don't have to present anything <oos>  
that makes sense  
mm  
um take away the l. c. display  
uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older  
otherwise we could have uh we could imagine to have a whole table of of uh <unk> well of l. e. d. <unk>  
one day a week uh something like this  
okay um  
yeah  
and also like a clapping uh  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
so i don't think we need to redesign the <unk> the product  
i'm gonna have to go very soon because i've got this um this hearing to go to  
it seems that we have a problem with the  
it's uh  
mm  
as that is the main function  
and it can't be him it can't be me  
yeah  
but it's still around right  
no that's right  
ah  
that you don't have to buy new batteries if every  
i i uh when you compare to the  
so it's sort of looking into how we wanted <unk> to do it by feel  
so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle you know those things  
i say good guess  
and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah <unk> yeah because  
uh <unk> flat  
mm  
so if speak changes  
yeah the oh they inc uh they include the new one  
jurgen you want to go next  
or here for example  
but  
okay  
i'm just trying to make this pop up now  
um th they are quite strange  
i suppose it has a <unk> oh my god  
now we have to decide on what kind of <unk>  
yeah uh i brilliant  
hmm  
mm  
and if you want it if you want the custom design then you can buy the separate covers  
it's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there  
<unk>  
oh there we go  
so you know  
right it's uh kind of <unk> no c. d. m. a. is uh another level i think  
we've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon  
the remote control has <unk> corporate image colour logo or slogan  
um where is that  
i dunno  
th th they're referring to the fruit and <unk> thing  
if he makes it a four  
a three  
and then on the right is obviously an ipod which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there  
or  
really  
it  
you know and that um picks up an input from a user  
um well yes i had uh about three minutes ago but i've seem to forget them forgot them  
so we should have specific t. v.  
uh line <unk>  
the is it so i mean you should  
okay  
and i'll just provide that because that's just not much more work than just the usual thing  
it's you program it like you say record um and then play and then  
well teletext is not an option so that uh but i think it's very important to make um the power  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yes  
but if it but if it's really not absolutely not clear  
no  
well this this prototype is um made for about uh well <unk> <unk> fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars  
yeah  
so uh  
what do you know  
yeah  
uh how it should look  
no  
there is something turning  
i suspect the remote control does need a battery but  
so maybe we should do that there as well  
i mean this is basically numbers volume uh channel up and down  
thank you  
how much context should i take  
i think they might do  
i think that's what you guys are gonna do next so if we put down the key um things that we want  
this one  
okay now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already that's cheap  
yeah  
okay  
yes  
okay  
oh of course  
yeah  
but if i open it and then save it probably will be there  
<unk> are we including the voice are you <unk> are we including the voice in the end or not  
okay  
or yeah that's right  
yep  
maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station  
remote control  
yes go to the project evaluation next slide  
and we're sort of saying no to that  
okay  
the intention was to use it as a way to introduce <oos> post <oos> students to the <oos> research culture  
uh this is basis station is nothing more  
yeah and the use of the rubber  
mm-hmm  
either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room you are gonna  
and volume  
oh yeah  
um n. e. z.  
do you already know how many students you have  
mm-hmm  
yeah yeah  
right come on  
there  
you just <unk> turn <unk> <unk>  
so we have to keep talking english now  
uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals <unk> to um a <unk> and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons  
so um  
yeah  
sure  
the user interface connected to a chip which is connected to the sender which generates messages using uh infrared light which are sent to the receiver  
but i think that balance against the fact that most people want to be able to say well look i can have just this one day off  
what's the uh idea  
mm-hmm  
and uh yeah i  
no that's the <unk>  
fifty mill  
like if this was the search results  
where are are all the other presentations  
the  
so you won't lose them  
that's right  
<unk>  
that's true  
it's david <unk> the guy that came up with uh with l. d. a.  
yeah yeah  
oh  
and we could share information which we received  
i dunno  
oh  
yeah i. p. o. or  
um there's three concepts in the user interface  
whoa  
yeah  
um oh <unk> i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple a regular or an advanced chip maybe  
um yeah i mean one thing i mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep i mean keep the um the articulation  
have we  
then the next time you pick it oh  
it's definitely  
yeah okay but just press save and uh  
um the important ones are the volume ones  
yeah  
um  
this is microphone array  
uh  
mm  
i  
ah yeah bright colours  
so let's say that people would want an l. c. d. thing  
and then uh one false seven points so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two  
mm-hmm  
yeah real reaction  
yep mm book a time and i think so  
and it's gonna be very difficult to tell whether they broke something <oos> without the language  
yep  
just need to know so i can write it down  
um yeah  
what kind of features do you use like do you use um any you don't yeah you don't  
but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote  
i think that has to come out of there  
right  
uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly  
yeah  
yeah i see  
so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view  
so it will be the <oos> for two weeks  
the information density levels based on and and the <unk> and the only <unk> you have is individual utterances  
is that clear  
yeah  
i think even even if it was within budget do a speech <unk> rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching t. v. you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the t. v. which might interfere with the  
we have the uh characteristics  
get yourself in position  
line peak  
ah  
uh  
we've decided on the functions  
yeah  
i guess you did do it  
okay  
on thing uh  
alright  
okay  
so similar idea  
yeah  
okay i've done that  
barks  
that's true i guess  
one problem with s. s. h. <unk> in general is that the machine that like on the only gateway machines they hate you for doing anything on them  
uh from yeah yeah  
um blink would uh uh at the moment just get lumped in with the sort of previous gaze  
but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement  
even we can provide many different colours or different fruits and  
i <unk> i didn't check the finish button  
do you think our two kind of overlap because  
yes you can colour rubber yeah  
um liquid crystal colour display and um  
and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point two point or seven point  
but maybe my have a <unk> for publishing another paper or something  
and uh make the menu structure changeable  
and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap  
the the the overall value or overall likelihood or whatever you call it why he's using the whole signal for this  
mm-hmm  
crashed  
they have to buy it later on  
i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there  
we have to uh <unk> uh want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half euro  
it's yeah i never get this so what's the point of if this is <unk> if this <unk> supposed to go behind <unk> i obviously doing this wrong  
yeah it's a  
mm-hmm  
i don't think in my personal opinion gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them  
that's <oos>  
yeah so maybe if  
okay  
uh it's the ipod uh kind of uh  
alright  
um i dunno what's the idea for  
yeah  
um  
yeah  
different directions  
uh okay so that data might be slightly <oos>  
i think this is the  
okay  
hmm  
it has eight legs  
mm <unk>  
rubber as well  
so if you uh sum up uh everything  
clever clever well done  
i took a dog  
because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television  
that's my task  
it's true that the reading room but you know we <oos> so much to have it so let's uh let's try to have it there  
we weren't doing flat spectrum <unk> were we  
that's that's quite cool but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right  
okay okay understand  
<unk> voice recognition which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
to user  
that probably doesn't make any sense at all whereas if you just uh show important utterances but the utterance as a whole it makes more sense  
and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote no  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
the yeah  
yeah but the uh can't we <unk> uh fit all the buttons in an <unk> integrated scroll push button  
that's quite strange  
be simple and you'll lean on this market  
you can see these things and but you wouldn't be able to point at one of them and say ah that's a damp yeah  
so we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes  
here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation  
yeah  
well there's <unk>  
we're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria um  
and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in  
yeah <unk> energy source  
different fronts  
yeah  
you just coloured it  
okay  
yeah  
well a little bit like the yes  
yeah that's a bit rough at the minute  
dog  
yeah  
well all you really wanna do is look into getting some sub set of the <unk> corpus off the dice machines  
yeah  
says his uh that was in the second meeting i think  
i've seen other <unk> people's transcription guidelines like <unk> for the um <unk> project at berkeley and elsewhere say indicating that it really doesn't matter and it's the point is just to get 'em into manageable units  
you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen  
huh  
that is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros and have a selling price of twice that price <unk> in order to target a <unk> profit of uh fifty uh million euros  
yeah yeah  
oh well  
so actually defining all of those as the construct is gonna be the <oos> thing  
yeah  
mm  
because i think this thing  
the rubber rather than  
we haven't got the five minute left thing yet  
yeah this uh this would be a <unk> uh another subject i would like to discuss  
so but yep  
yeah  
oh do they  
it's quite the same  
'kay  
no 'cause like <unk> 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying  
i think so  
yeah i don't think <unk> i think we have to choose  
and their segments do overlap  
mm-hmm  
right  
the group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables  
if you have to do that all the time then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it  
so uh yeah  
oh  
then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know which what the threshold is  
oh because we  
so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all  
it will appeal <unk> for <unk> for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so i i yeah i  
so okay  
okay  
but i've saved it  
we need not to have a full cover we will just have a half of cover okay  
right  
at least i am with the results so uh celebration well  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control  
again you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one  
so  
hello  
<unk> yeah  
we're talking about long life batteries here  
okay  
yo  
i would say flying saucer  
it just needs to be easy to use  
let's see  
in fact i'll give it some more  
mm  
anyway  
i'm matthew  
so now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things  
you know  
yeah  
a. y. alright oops  
i mean we we have to <unk> reflect back on what our market research did say  
right  
interesting  
watch out well i think according to the latest documentation uh you're down for five percent of your fifteen months on this project or something  
if if remote control well if telephones can be fashionable then maybe remote control units can be  
um  
right  
oh that would be perfect  
let it be  
i think we <unk> should just lower this  
the g. d. f. sounds like it might take a wee while  
no i i it's the all around <unk> uh microphone isn't it  
not older than forty maybe that's not very uh yeah we don't really need to have a simple remote control  
well it's you know this curve like this so it's <unk> there is only  
ah  
i mean given the nature of the buttons we're having it's actually uh uh unnecessary i think  
so it will cost us <unk> practically nothing  
hmm  
maybe by presenting the project little bit  
yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button so one two three  
mm  
i just don't have enough money right now  
um you see  
okay  
how far should we go  
scroll wheel with push button on it  
we did the project evaluation based on um sarah's evaluation of on off switches and  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
then just choose one and leave it right  
any any other uh <unk>  
i i think yeah yeah <unk> universal remote  
mm-hmm  
ah  
now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls  
then i'll just say i support either from a marketing point of view i support either decision that the designers make on that  
then th  
mm  
so next i propose the industrial user interface to present things  
right  
okay um uh i'm speaking about it because uh we wanted uh to do this table in uh a mid tech way let's say a cheap way  
no no but <unk>  
um and one other thing is to break break up long segments if you find any  
and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick like uh button  
so welcome  
and you <unk> speed it up as well i think  
yeah  
so uh this person left out a lot of end punctuation and um here's a case where i think she was transcribing an out breath um or possibly an in breath uh <unk> uh in and used the hash mark  
or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide  
it's like all very flat and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons but  
it can be made of plastic rubber wood <unk> if you like or titanium  
that's more on the research end but the marketing  
yeah  
okay  
so  
ta da  
uh well uh <unk> did we already decide on the display  
lovely to see you all again  
such as it is  
okay  
you you press it for like three seconds  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
um  
if there isn't any problems  
we could  
okay  
we have hand dynamo  
ten to twenty and this one <unk> one two three four five six like this  
'cause <unk> <unk> apparently <unk> uh i'm not sure  
yep  
okay  
well it's just my way of of knowing if it <unk> sorry 'cause linguistics is all i've ever known  
or  
maybe use single curved uh case  
may need more than three mm three button three mm possibilities ye yeah  
i can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have well about six hundred channels i can imagine you want this  
well because for the same reason that we cannot  
so where are gonna put the search results  
so <unk> it doesn't just look like a big panel kinda like when you you look at  
that's that's problem  
well it depends on the on the on the looks on the on the  
because it's  
you know kind of thing  
okay  
but you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section  
we'll do our best  
yeah  
because i think the <unk> whole dynamic part do you know appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy you know  
yeah  
why not  
um from all all three of your uh presentations i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting  
uh  
i can reach for the next thing and you can go where i reach  
mm  
disadvantages with this  
then make it th three  
um  
whatever which is visible  
yeah which wouldn't probably wouldn't give us the kind of um information that we need about relations across turns  
okay  
because uh if you if you if you if you use a machine which has been already used for something else sometimes you have plenty of libraries  
this is a battery  
you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice  
well the <unk> main one for me is that uh the process  
yeah i think you have  
well let's also give this a two  
i'm probably gonna eat something quick  
you're agree tim  
okay  
that's it  
but that's 'cause we've to know it's a rather broad <unk> absorption line object we have seen it  
uh no sorry it should be  
um but since i haven't tried it this particular way you know um but yeah that sounds good  
yeah  
you are <unk> you can't really do it on whatever database you have  
acquisition  
mm  
yeah  
yeah  
or  
but it will be an added value also that will be <oos> so hmm  
uh  
yeah  
yeah  
is it an only a single mic or a microphone array  
mm  
okay  
right  
okay  
okay  
anyway i'm i'm <unk> kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it  
product launch party  
is he a <unk>  
and you get the <unk> on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down  
um and i think that  
changing covers is also trend that we followed  
yeah  
that's basically uh how it works  
yeah  
yeah yeah  
so  
i <unk> i didn't read 'em  
draw uh my <unk> my uh <oos> reasoning is no good  
what about like batteries and things like that like are there some remotes that don don't require  
think it was called command interface  
on  
huh  
three  
and the chip will um send it to all kind of sub components  
well that makes things uh  
so i had a look  
i type faster than i write  
yeah that's that's why uh i wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions  
the basic battery  
probably  
okay  
a person  
so i've got a very quick uh  
that was the main criteria from the last meeting it had to be chew proof  
we have time  
you know i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because  
and then you can start to <unk> these uh different situations  
okay  
the segment is what is displayed in one line um by nite  
uh where am i  
yeah  
and as these are ranked the top one is doubly important to the second one  
yeah  
i need teeth  
okay  
well i guess more realistically then we need a product that's got some kinda <oos> outer casing cheap plastic uh  
um well thank you all huh  
it it's pointing there and saying look there's a high excitation emission  
might be left or right everything there but not the whole context  
so we will simulate our  
towards yourself so you can easily see your screen  
so that's our three prototypes  
so we need some <oos> buttons some teletext things and then um  
and it's been very hard to to to use  
and it very very highly scores on the p. l. s. a. for one of the the topics  
mm-hmm  
i dunno if you should uh take that in consideration or that you just should aim for the normal t. v. <unk> that uh  
yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly  
mm-hmm  
then we don't have to worry about it  
so we can try to use uh the <unk> here  
yeah  
and it's not it's not an immediate problem anyway  
yes won't be very present thank you  
for the cameras  
yeah  
okay well  
or maybe the fourth would be good  
i think that might scare me  
th this is flat  
we might wanna keep it yellow  
yeah everything's okay  
e. i. e.  
yeah i would be careful with that  
mm  
maybe a a <unk> a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven  
but there's a certain amount of um <oos> you pay to the way they do things in the literature to get your papers published  
um things like on off  
so you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely or  
demo one  
uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how  
um  
uh development one  
does it say what does it say for <unk> it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting i think  
ah yeah  
the uh just one slide back no no no  
i don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway  
it's yeah  
excuse me  
uh  
but the but but but the  
<unk>  
and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark  
if you  
um i mean <unk> if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if i'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know  
but still  
mm-hmm  
from the client point of view and from the preparation of the movie d. v. d. mm  
special uh is the special colour  
yeah  
oh right i see  
so if you want the spongy feel you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber  
but well you just take up all the space and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used  
no  
there's a good man  
well then the marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market  
had a dog  
you can do the get frame  
we just play around  
basically what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers  
sure okay  
we don't know what you are going to find on the way  
basic  
yeah  
okay  
yeah we're to go for li and now i think we have many options in the market so we can go for small <oos> or alkaline batteries for  
mm-hmm  
it's literally a case of whether or not this is correct  
'kay  
alright  
it's in option  
yeah  
yeah <unk> i think  
uh in my second sheet of personal preferences uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition  
uh and also things that i uh i <unk> i forget to uh to put like solar cells  
um  
say we don't make it <unk> a particular fruit shape obviously but uh give it like the surface of  
you want to dump the titanium  
right  
um  
yeah  
well this is  
yeah  
oh  
oops that fell off  
okay  
what this button for  
go on  
basically uh one thing it can't be done  
you want buttons for them and everything else menu driven  
yeah  
they're unique  
right  
so my idea is to <unk> do something like that is to develop a <unk> um  
<unk>  
yeah  
that's industrial design for <oos> stuff like that  
the menus uh are not identical for all th for all t. v. <unk> so you have to display it on one uh t. v.  
um the it's based on this anti anti <oos> technology for <oos> and stuff where you have one piece that's attached to your <oos> another piece that starts beeping  
so that's um the user interface  
yeah  
and so that potentially helpful hopefully helpful to to do recognition  
no no  
honestly i think the customer would be kind of <oos> by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small compact  
we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface  
i don't think here it's in here already  
yeah  
remember how did i do it  
it's pretty mechanical  
hmm  
which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs  
you can make it um  
well may from different point of view  
whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way it tends to get moved accidentally  
the sound sound and image  
yes  
yeah  
point four million  
um for user interface technical functions i guess that's you know like what we've been talking about what it'll actually do  
<unk> yeah wood is not really yeah  
and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
it only has to match the the channel frequency on your t. v. with with the with the position on your t. v. and and so your remote  
i think it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device  
it's a bunny  
mm-hmm  
okay  
it's the same yeah  
it's a hypothesis  
two  
you can also do microphone arrays with directional microphones  
and you just choose one and then all all the options will become available and you just <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> scroll through them  
two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control  
yeah  
here we go  
um  
no the  
well <unk> <unk> you have also the language problem you know when you  
um  
take <unk>  
well six then  
i was very surprised that even the <oos> did have a a. c. there  
you'll rather use <unk> and work it out in advance  
yeah  
and then um that that you will see it on the t. v.  
alright yeah  
well i think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop  
yes <unk> <unk> but when we use <unk> soft  
she'd be like is this a remote control i don't how do you use it and stuff like that  
you know  
mm-hmm  
your turn <oos>  
well i use it very regularly the action  
you guys heard of jeff buckley  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
okay  
uh where l. c.  
oh we just need one i guess  
if you are  
okay  
screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour  
present here agenda with with with with slides  
because if you wanna browse internet or i don't know if you wanna type something or  
yeah  
yeah that will be handy  
a key aspect is the easy to use aspect  
but uh as you indicated uh it should be strong  
a multifunctional remote control which can be used for several entertainment devices  
we don't have to follow every trend i guess  
uh  
but for the verbal version there are ways of <oos> that now we're doing a new one right  
let's put that rubber in then of the case material supplement  
no  
yeah  
so construct two could <unk> um construct one is um a red triangle and a green square  
okay  
but for a very fixed number of words you know you have  
oh what happened to the  
is there another battery there  
i imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the  
i mean maybe if you did some sort of initial first <unk> guess and then and then chose your smoothing factor based on that  
then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen  
yeah true  
because you need to you <unk> you need to put all the technology in  
with blue l. e. d. inside  
and i don't really think that you need nine numbers  
thank you very much uh  
in real numbers does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million  
than  
accordingly they will tell you whether they can recover or not  
and you  
possibilities yeah  
mm-hmm  
um also key is the corporate image should stay <unk> um <unk> uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there  
yeah  
yeah exactly yeah  
yeah  
didn't say an anything about me really but  
okay  
no none  
so that that's uh that's the point  
yeah but i it's not uh it was uh you know <unk> this is working the expand all but uh this is uh  
then it's the remote control for the the sound system or for your refrigerator whatever i dunno if it's  
but  
um and can we have like an r. r. <oos> on the bottom or something  
uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back part of the titanium uh titanium part  
alright it's a one  
and now it's uh <unk> close <unk> actually <unk> is doing a a lot of that now  
it's  
yeah  
or what  
um  
but i'm but i'm not quite clear yet what you think the lack is  
uh  
okay um and we wanted special colours didn't we  
okay  
so  
yeah  
shoot  
yeah  
blank  
<unk> how do we feel in terms of is this fancy  
yeah  
because i  
yeah <unk> <unk> you you wouldn't  
so like we can those  
it's from rubber  
yeah  
yeah right  
the data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer  
i mean the power for the t. v.  
okay it's alright  
we're trying not to over complicate things  
you have standard old battery control uh remote con  
or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates  
sometimes in in in in the beginning i didn't understand what what to do  
okay we'll get back on that later  
we could do that because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if  
so my question was going to be alright the the mouse is a dynamic object right  
next slide please  
yeah  
because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on <unk>  
so you got the option of having different colours or different textures  
okay  
then people find the idea funny that when i move my remote control around and  
i will take this away 'cause it looks messy  
uh  
yeah  
no other papers it's just one paper and and festival  
yeah  
you can't you can say there were three <unk> and they <oos> uh a certain time  
for example um we'll work backwards i suppose  
alright  
okay  
pressure  
i hope you all have been uh updated about it  
so i see all everybody's here 'kay  
yeah maybe even on a <unk> on a sing like i is that on a <unk> like is that on a word basis would that be single words  
so  
yeah too new is really definitely because like want to at least see i at least four  
submit  
wants to but at least this one  
so maybe we can put one  
remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little <oos> remotes inside  
mm-hmm  
okay  
well it is the whole name yes i get  
i don't know  
yeah  
yep that's me  
so on the back  
it's the technical function or the functional requirements  
little rabbits  
it would be nice too i mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to <oos> to it  
yep  
yes yes it has  
a <unk> butterfly  
ah that's nice  
think it need shoes  
mm yeah  
it's very much work  
or maybe like interchangeable cases  
um because our <unk> um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext  
okay  
if you have an l. c. d. screen that's burns all the time i dunno  
we're going to vote  
so we can make it small if we have a <unk> locating device  
hmm  
let's have some fun  
or rubber and um  
a fluffy remote  
no but like  
we can think about an interface with uh well  
okay so we're all agreeing on seven for a.  
yeah especially if <unk> <unk> if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting i guess  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an l. c. d. screen or on their <unk> function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of  
okay i'll for industrial design  
mm  
i think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had  
then the whole bureaucracy kicks in like this gets the <unk> <oos> this gets the <oos>  
um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about <oos> this and then just a bit of discussion close up  
hmm  
he's a cool customer  
uh yeah  
so it's at one given moment still  
i i'd before we break up for lunch i just wanna make sure that <unk> that i know how long it's gonna be before we're in run mode okay  
oh a cat  
like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us  
but maybe there's some option that uh that <unk> uh the kind of show view numbers are violent and that they are blocked out  
uh  
that's groovy  
there is no information  
yeah  
so if you use a rubber double curved case you must use rubber push buttons  
so that we because in the end we don't want it on a per word basis but probably on a per segment base  
so you see it fine but suddenly you have one other frame they don't know what it is and where it comes from  
right  
oh this the thing we were talking about earlier  
like roller for the yeah  
as it turned out the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick  
you know so we just sort of we shift it one level up  
no  
so they're to put all these things on again d. s. p. <unk>  
yeah i think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use  
well it's  
the the l. c. d. thing but i i think it's it's not a good idea and we have already mentioned all the arguments  
you would normally you go to a meeting you decide right you do this you do that you do that  
you <unk> mute and you <unk> you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control  
uh that's <unk> uh that's that's a decision we'll uh uh uh i'm saying is if they're looking if most of what their overlap is here then we stick with that one  
but um apparently um market shows that bigger <unk> bigger um remotes get less lost about  
is that the project document  
well you have to make it work  
um  
we're on to the  
i'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the  
but we shouldn't talk about that  
how th this voice operation thing is i think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable  
it takes space a lot of space  
that seems to me clear  
mm-hmm  
so you must for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics  
the digit  
and we we had a manual which we haven't got here  
yeah but would you take it from from my directory  
oh it's a <oos> movie  
what do you think  
excellent right  
it's speech and and okay  
okay  
only scroll wheel  
heavy element absorption lines i think should be there  
okay specifically television  
and <unk> this is going to come  
so um when you say interactivity do you mean um well how would you <unk> a highly interactive meeting  
yeah  
um to start with these points  
you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is  
hmm  
but they're still not uh quite okay  
um hand dynamo  
and then you reacting to what you did a while ago  
yeah  
like a <oos> wood and um i don't know <oos> green or something  
uh <unk> frank went through it deleted the people that were have gone or or whatever and replaced them  
and you could just see that on the remote rather than  
yeah  
the the zapping channel switching volume  
mm-hmm  
you used to <unk> oh no keck observatory  
oh really  
my goodness  
<unk>  
oh watches i've but i've never <oos> a cell phone  
yeah  
sorry that kinda cut into you there  
but then that that surely <unk> depends a little on the t. v. because some t. v. <unk> are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you <unk> you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the t. v. <unk> ability to to change channels  
so <unk> when you so then it  
yeah so you don't have to display here just display on the t. v. screen right  
yeah okay uh  
mm-hmm  
i think that's <unk> that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone  
you do you have to push a to to get below zero  
the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor  
yeah  
so probably plastic or something  
and only the the l. c. d. panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options  
mm-hmm  
um 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well  
and draw it very big  
so in fact yeah the interface is quite is quite simple to use  
mm  
yeah  
thirty minutes lunch break  
yeah well this is basically uh it's alright the remote  
mm  
next  
mm  
so it's very good for some people but it's not a like  
anyway it ha yeah it's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen  
what  
so  
yeah but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control  
that's true  
uh functional  
it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing  
but um  
no  
mm  
yeah okay well i'll just uh i'll load it up then  
it needs to be  
mm-hmm  
so  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so one one battery  
i've i've definitely eaten it before  
hmm  
but for all these s. and r. <unk> so that's also again  
do you have any question  
but anyway that's uh  
oh  
yeah  
mm  
now we know that it's a t. v. remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh r. and d. for that  
so i think of a name  
oh it just had to be on there i guess  
maybe a thousand people or a million people  
the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings um they weren't used very often at all  
right  
so you've got two <oos> you've got the one that you've just got from p. l. s. a. or whatever model and you've got the one that you get from this  
yep  
um i think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear  
oh  
right  
so basically we've got three things and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options  
there was a step about drawing something in the in the board i don't know  
okay  
yeah  
miniature size  
okay  
so you know within a speaker turn you can have things like explanation and cause and all that  
louder <unk> that should be relatively simple  
assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position um <unk> uh holding the remote  
but it just it it just just happened to be a convex part that i was that i was i was playing with  
so the first model said it was an english page 'cause all the words were in english  
mm-hmm  
bottom  
so that's the the the first point  
yeah  
or uh  
um  
huh  
really different colours basically  
hmm  
it's the <oos> remote control i've ever seen  
and then there is there is the chip which is sitting the green one and it converts it into bit codes  
'kay  
not just the word channel and the word fifteen it doesn't have that kind of logic in it  
yeah well who knows  
uh you i it could be proposed  
the entire uh  
the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more  
um  
mm-hmm  
um  
yeah this maybe i think yeah this he's getting some improvement but  
although they they may be buying um you know personal music devices and all that are they necessarily buying t. v. remote controls  
and then then we could have curved shapes 'cause wood or titanium yeah  
exactly  
no you can't  
it costs a lot i think  
i can tell you that uh in a <unk> in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this  
from th from the location  
and so personal what i was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel  
so how many remotes do they wanna buy  
it's different  
um lots of considerations for the case like what sort of shape it would be curved or flat  
so it's classically retro  
okay jolly good  
but uh i think the uh i think the most important results are already in the thesis he's writing  
mm-hmm  
user  
two euros  
<unk> kinda <unk>  
we need to think about mm mm  
mm  
here we had  
mm  
mm  
what's the speaker turn um you know what kind of dialogue acts do you expect  
huh doesn't match up does it  
and then on the other side <unk> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel  
oh yeah  
mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being <unk> i mean it'll it'll mm  
we'll have more money to go into the design side of it  
no don't bother  
it's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market  
yeah that's a good idea  
it's maybe more in browsing  
yeah right  
uh  
yeah  
uh th <unk> i i would say just the number of <unk>  
and then  
yeah  
th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want huh  
uh besides this in <unk> under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender  
that kind of thing see  
it's just one mo single mould we can do that  
okay yeah that's <unk>  
okay  
yeah  
true  
no it's okay  
uh and i'm gonna write up our results on the board  
so whole observation sequence means having complete <unk> information and the mod uh and the model can encode some kind of prior knowledge for us by means of uh <oos> constraints  
oh  
and then we could keep it titanium  
and there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker which is a little <oos> uh to me  
yeah  
yeah  
that's talking about uh  
yeah  
next please  
so just for explanation  
yeah it would have <unk>  
mm-hmm  
that's probably because it's coming from my resolution and it's you have a much higher resolution  
okay but we have to think uh <unk> we have to think d. v. d. i th uh i guess  
oh that's okay  
yeah  
i have to sorry  
user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control you think it's possible  
which are then processed by an m. l. p. and it gives us some <oos> as in the form of <unk> phone <unk>  
uh it looks <oos>  
um  
um uh <unk> ellen might have views on what kinds of things once we have a list right  
yeah even if it is not completely wood but just a part of the  
look  
that's one euro  
it <oos> into place such that you know it's pretty permanent but at the same time  
okay  
okay that looks good  
but i didn't i uh  
and uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered  
alright that's decided  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad  
or  
oh  
you know what they do it's very simple and it just works  
well that's it we'll never see him here again  
so that if the x. m. l. uh you feel there is not enough um uh shots you can instead of <oos> the video you you <unk> this file  
and i just find them interesting animals  
okay  
let's make it thirteen or fourteen  
yeah  
yep  
yeah it may be a good idea to do that  
uh-huh  
so it's sort of <oos> that that then they're in there  
'kay so  
well perhaps not  
um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand  
yeah  
so that would show that volume was going up whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down  
<unk>  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the <unk> at the controller so finally that <unk> eliminates the the need for l. c. d.  
yeah you leave the <unk> yeah i know but still i they will think about that  
if you want to improve the recognition that <unk> <oos> very slightly  
so uh one  
do you know  
yeah it's actually like literally half a <oos> from my house  
okay this is a measure of the activity <unk> okay  
and i would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get <unk> off by things by having to read instructions et cetera so  
um personal preferences  
yes  
um it's in what is implemented in rainbow is information gain and i'm not quite sure how they calculate that  
right  
it's it's easy to load that much just text  
yeah  
but you can hide the okay and the back uh button  
looks good  
and at the end of the day we have a final meeting  
okay  
what kind of th thickness are we looking at  
you how can you make it any easier  
okay  
instantly sort of always going for the right handed person  
and uh  
okay  
hmm  
yeah  
'cause that's maybe what you'd want if you were a user  
yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email  
you can clap or something  
and features included also one  
right  
or do <unk> do you find it helpful to have it  
okay okay so then this  
alright  
uh excuse me <unk>  
so we make a yeah a line between them  
it's all just  
so more uh birds  
maybe okay  
okay  
don't you think  
um function f. eight  
well if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people  
okay  
well it doesn't  
it's low power  
so um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
that that's the information i received  
yeah  
shape  
but  
it's not very fashionable anymore  
we should aim to get some names for segments like just some extraction of something that we can call  
um <unk> next i will explain one by one the first is google controller  
i feel like this is <unk> or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun  
yeah  
yeah  
so we have  
hmm  
mm-hmm  
um right  
mm-hmm  
and uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes  
um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a <unk> um a questionnaire and a summaries summary  
in each sector you will get the value  
silicone two is an element rather than a  
uh make a new sheet  
mm  
does it makes it kinda  
i have a complete list of uh everything that we can use all the components that all <unk> available  
the microphone  
yeah but you need another sensor for that right  
who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in  
okay sure  
yeah yeah  
three euros yep  
you know what i mean  
hmm  
except the new digital markets which do it by themselves  
uh-huh  
we're trying to get our name out there in the world  
why  
well  
that's it  
but maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal but  
mm  
yeah <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that's i think it's better because of the l. c. d. screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the  
we can probably just process some sort of meta data you know what i mean like sort of sort of for the whole series  
it was originally in black and white but it became black and purple  
um  
so you made a start right  
okay so yeah i will i will give a brief outline about what i what i prepared for this meeting  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
and not all people will need all the <unk> we propose to them  
yeah yeah  
for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting  
yeah  
yeah  
uh discuss some colours and design maybe already  
and next one was the size of the remote control  
<unk> <unk> through and selecting a few  
but it's going to be already there in m. m. m. okay  
yeah that would be another way to do it  
so you can show us what you've been working on so <oos>  
so you don't <unk> yeah but you don't really estimate motion  
how it works  
okay  
remote control  
<unk> <unk> yeah <unk> fairly basic you guys think  
so um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product  
uh-huh  
no but test set is digits your <unk> main task is digits <unk> yeah  
uh i'm not sure it's it's hard to make  
but you don't want to <oos> the other uh  
don't we have uh other uh <unk>  
yes she's so she spelled it wrong  
yeah  
basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control you want to <unk> store your favourite channel  
sometimes i've made buts after la like words after laughter i've made them <unk>  
mm-hmm  
and the photocopier and the printer are sort of in the hall on the side there across from mailboxes  
because at the moment it's zero point one seconds and that's just there is actually there are some background noise when it's working and i think that is because it's like doing so much every time  
uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah  
yeah  
for instance through uh through your remote control  
okay  
okay  
sure  
while you're watching it's gonna roll off  
ah  
that'll give some transcriber a headache  
yeah  
so in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect  
oh  
that's right  
it's it's not necessary like an l. c. d. but it's just it adds something to the design  
here is my marketing report maybe you ca you can look at uh that and  
so the solution to that low quality is uh solved <unk> by you project the pas project  
you divided by the  
then it's your turn the marketing expert  
yeah  
we can use any of them as the beginning of any of them as a start point for example right  
yes  
yeah  
than the  
it's trendy trendy fun yeah  
but th this one wasn't good because if i was drawing here i drew a line and then it came over here  
oh right  
<unk>  
instead of clapping why not just be ask  
yeah okay  
uh if it's possible with uh different um covers but i'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish  
i can say in this country you'll get you know lots of people wanting something really funky and cool  
and there stands there is couple of things well it's uh  
i mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am i gonna do  
yeah  
or <unk>  
an object yes  
yeah  
no no  
but if you can work around that that noise problem  
i dunno if  
but th that's  
uh i think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button  
yeah i mean that's that's  
mm-hmm  
uh-huh  
it's supposed to be a luxurious remote maybe it's not even that expensive  
h. alpha <unk> are not  
i wouldn't pick that one no  
no  
signal  
but this is phase of your <unk> uh spectrum no  
it's impossible  
so more complicated than i thought  
lazy  
mm-hmm  
and then i so you split it in two frequency sub bands  
yeah  
i'd say maybe three  
but that's one <unk> one segment or is that two segments then  
yeah <unk> wide screen high screen different things you have yeah different uh yeah  
um what ideally one wants one doesn't really want to <unk> to have these things  
the method i used was um giving orders to our <unk> lab uh to do a questionnaire  
then you go down you switch you go into the right you switch you go down  
um and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions  
i just as a contrast i trained one specifically on this data  
thank you kate  
i'll i'll fix it  
so  
does anyone do you wanna go first  
yeah 'cause i think you program um this one yourself like to say like whatever you want to your question  
uh i'll shortly ask for for three three presentations  
but i'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things  
yeah  
yeah  
well <unk> not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that  
product  
but the actual sort of what you're trying to measure might need to be slightly slightly different i guess  
or something  
that <unk> that match of context to computer commas  
yeah  
punish  
uh-huh  
yeah i think that's the first  
everything else was satisfactory  
um if you just click on one of the arrows  
wouldn't be simple yeah  
control  
i  
my <unk> my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected  
okay  
so some way that i can i can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um but this <unk> just something  
right  
like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control but then they're like  
okay okay  
i feel totally at ease  
<unk> <unk> drop speech recognition  
um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing uh shoes and furniture  
you know inverse filtering for um signal reconstruction or anything like that can you  
yeah four is okay  
and the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a t. v. or uh a stereo or something  
uh the the form of the remote control i think it's also nice have it curved  
hmm  
and come to a decision on our remote control functions of of how this is going to be  
my vote too  
however oh because the voice recognition software exists already  
okay set the beginning  
uh  
so if there's just the initial thing you've put it in the middle of the screen that's just the initial object right  
knows more than than than i do  
it could be two utterances  
right  
i don't think that's uh really appropriate  
four five seven nine  
technical uh designer again  
and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting  
it's like yeah a good selling point  
this  
sure sure  
yeah two or three  
so the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to <unk> so children will not touch the button inside  
so this the opening we'll uh  
or maybe you should place them on a uh in a special way  
yes they do  
hmm  
so i the processing on on the remote controller so it can <unk> be used in any t. v. any conventional t. v. sets  
yeah mine seems to have turned off  
yep  
come on  
ah okay okay  
buttons <oos> in a  
uh th <unk> that's not too relevant necessarily but if you have say a topic distribution for uh one page  
lose a little bit on the fashion yeah but  
they'd spent the morning talking and they came up with this idea  
mm-hmm  
as an overall product which has to be quite cheap we've just about achieved  
yeah  
i support an apple  
but i suppose it's not as <oos>  
yes  
because  
i think that could be our selling point  
first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel  
a general kind of more acceptable but we don't wanna go towards boring 'cause that wouldn't sell either  
like um for the next couple of days i'll do some on it 'cause i was just too busy last week  
if it's simple to do  
but less buttons this would definitely be a good way of selling more  
right  
i i was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume left and right for channels  
we all have to use this one  
and yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health  
uh-huh yeah  
<unk> uh  
and they say basically that the s. r. system would be uh something like three francs per item so three euros sorry  
when you don't touch the control but you go out of the  
oh no <unk> oh that's one euro right  
and big brother  
did you manage to to divide the link uh properly or  
but i've i would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do <unk> of a large number of channels  
mm-hmm  
<unk> objects  
okay yeah  
okay two  
and and for a <unk> uh teletext you need additional buttons as well so i kind of need to know what we uh need  
bad answer right  
and we gotta sell twenty five of them  
the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p. c. for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice  
well i have your <unk> presentation i can get some <unk> information out of that  
so i i dunno if there's something that  
so it kind of holds nicely something like that  
no i think uh i think we has already have plenty to read  
it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology wise price wise  
okay yeah  
in that case then um these tiers are already like blink corrected  
and i try to get chip just before uh i uh receive the excel sheet  
it i mean it's it's total of three hundred sort of parameters per second  
yeah  
hmm  
and he's he'll be working on things which he cannot talk about  
yes  
yeah but for two euros then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip then two euros isn't even possible  
no okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and  
yeah  
<unk> <unk> oh i think it's better to have this without l. c. d.  
pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically  
battery  
am i starting now  
that's that's definitely a cat  
<unk> that um  
i this is volume control and channel changes  
and everyone's gonna be satisfied  
the budget  
yes  
in about uh half an hour  
and i think it's anyway if it's too <unk> after they may want to go inside uh to see whether there is not special things i mean so  
okay okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
well this so so i think uh uh i  
it depends on the design we want so  
well that's the thing as have we decided that we can only spend uh twenty five euro  
how kind  
the findings were um well you can see them for yourself  
but i think data is equivalent if  
the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers  
uh-huh  
it's true  
is quite easy yeah  
so from uh um my analysis of that kind of dialogues i could say that there's only there only four basic uh exchanges depend on the information uh direction of the information flow  
i give me a lower price give me a higher price give me some new technology  
uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame  
alright  
having said that it's picking out some interesting stuff  
i'll get this  
no  
we have to think about that one  
i have no i still don't have any finance information but at least we have a lot more to go on now  
but don't we say we don't do that  
private room <unk>  
okay  
if we want something new we need to move away from what we already have  
so we can has less buttons  
but actually i think there is something in the audio shouldn't there  
then you ha you'll have volume control  
mm-hmm  
sure  
i like them because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time  
um for the buttons i thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel  
yeah  
i wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today  
you don't even need to lean down to get it  
you press the button it makes a noise right  
don't you  
yeah  
i think we've gotten to the point where you know to try to <unk>  
and i don't think everyone's gonna buy a real reaction t. v. within a month after the release of our uh remote control  
oh gosh no emission <unk> okay so i've highlighted this in <unk> red and then the whole thing in green because type two <unk> galaxies are one  
but all very quiet  
did you do now  
yeah well like <unk> li like some like some some remotes who are out there  
mm  
yeah  
so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones  
there's a lot of small uh electronics  
and i i'd mm sorry  
and uh the screen light blue  
sorry do you want that back up  
and of course our voice command system which i've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of <unk> colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so  
think they're just called face plates  
help  
okay  
so its main purpose in fact is a back light which change colours which makes it easier to find  
it's the um it looks like a y. kind of over there above draw  
i <unk> i i think i can do that fairly quickly because i have the algorithms  
just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well because i think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say i guess  
yeah  
i pretty much like a dolphin because of its uh its freedom basically  
yeah but it's quite interesting with the even with th uh <unk> current speech coding uh technologies  
um  
but when you say for example the the quasar is absorbed that just means the quasar is behind a a bunch of stuff  
something flat  
because we're all gonna be working in different places  
you have no  
context  
reverse  
um and the new requirements that it for be for t. v. only um and that it include the <unk> so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included  
um and then yeah and then it's a matter of we're gonna put whatever filters you need after that  
well i well it's really <unk> you can recharge it so you ha never have the battery problem  
might not want a fruity coloured remote so <unk> maybe we'd have one version that's a bit <oos> down maybe with with less <oos> on it  
yeah  
you can insert a new um slide or or white board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button  
complicated  
um for the meeting but i think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close  
<unk> next  
oh  
here's our designer  
and of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
that's like mine it was like would you prefer an l. c. d. screen or a <unk> remote control  
yeah  
means equivalent widths yeah  
mm  
oh yeah that's a good that's a good point so  
mm-hmm  
whatever and it <unk> records the uh the um the the signals  
huh  
it it does everything that i need it to uh as i said before  
no we could have a <unk> very simple touch screen you know there's always the opportunity  
the the look and the colour is something which is cool  
so  
mm-hmm  
and that shouldn't be in there  
well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design  
okay  
yeah  
there was a lot of synergy  
you can uh know  
yeah okay  
yes  
oh  
so you compute d. c. t. right from signal  
and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers  
then we have some money left  
because um maybe we can start with the technical uh functions  
um we're looking for a device  
nowadays it's not the case  
yeah  
i mean is is is taking time for the material and so on  
yes we should focus on that i guess  
different  
yep  
yeah let's increase it a little because  
okay  
but uh price price not withstanding um is it too complicated is it gonna be too much just overload  
yeah  
but  
uh  
yeah  
yeah no it's what i already said  
so anyway yeah we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example  
oh okay  
no we cannot yeah  
in the a. t. c.  
mm-hmm  
contact  
good idea  
no i don't think  
i've always wanted one of these i really have  
but i if you if you are going to uh put the l. c. d. on it  
and that makes me special  
mm-hmm  
okay  
yeah  
number two was that it be innovative  
well still we have the experts who who made the software on here you know  
previous previous channel button  
that it's it's fashionable  
yeah  
yeah  
uh so um um i'm the interface designer in this project and my favourite animal  
but it  
so these are important numbers that matthew and i need to take into account for our functional um  
so le le let's see  
any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts  
the new generation ones where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that  
um do we have um  
that's true but are we set on the banana  
there the icons  
yeah yeah  
um  
but like it needs do something that you know is new  
third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use  
what is it like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components you know  
but  
uh-huh  
yeah  
then <unk> blind don't watch t. v.  
don't <unk> don't sound don't sound familiar  
is is it something that's easily <unk> like to enumerate over  
uh he wouldn't have sent it just to me would he  
yeah i agree  
electronics  
so multi coloured buttons  
and we can put that on a <unk> or we can do it some other way  
next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on  
in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification  
if you get that far  
the different designs  
no  
well my <unk> is  
like if people start implementing like some people propose something in feature level some propose in something in model level but these two are really independent no  
nee uh one of the four uh  
mm-hmm  
eight  
but hopefully the that'll be done during the first pass because that's the whole point  
like this yeah mm mm mm okay  
real reaction  
we're entering a new market here so i think the the profit <oos> for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to  
yeah yeah yeah  
well like say you had um like say for a meeting right you've got like uh say a hierarchy that looks quite big like this  
as we have seen earlier the  
but you can't possibly know which one of the ones they're meant to replace  
ooh  
we  
i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people  
where where  
model two and model three and therefore you can sub divide your market up  
two  
also for the for the more uh yeah for the people  
great  
what do you choose  
uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote  
one possibility is to download program information into the l. c. d. screen so that instead of actually saying i want to i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this <unk> on  
<oos> hoo  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that  
and the results from that were almost the same as what we got for the c. t. s. model  
and first um  
but to get a cluster the location that is uh a place where uh noise is regularly coming from  
because the definition  
yeah  
i think all these things are pretty standard  
as the colour the  
<unk>  
so basically your your <unk> is trained on something that was derived off penn tree bank  
yeah that's true  
we've all had it once i want to watch some television where's the remote control  
but can we <unk> uh uh  
yeah but the the thing is it it isn't simply an act of setting a string default tool tip  
mm-hmm  
that's quite good  
okay so now uh we're moving on to finance okay  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i thought but this is really your department that we need just the functional display and four <unk>  
if it is something that it seems to be light  
certain  
maybe you can uh find it in your email right now then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us  
yeah  
if this is only gonna be a you know satellite cable t. v.  
true  
yeah you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be <oos> more than twelve dot fifty euros  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
i was i was satisfied with with the leadership yeah  
uh the sender will push the button the chip will respond uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the t. v.  
so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about  
then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will <unk> what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it  
i say neither of them  
is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing  
well if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere uh then you'd uh <unk> it as whoa that is strange  
uh  
like three d.  
yeah plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to  
say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury  
that's handy  
i mean i i well we <unk> we're talking about the other end now  
yes  
you'll find the next minutes also there  
sure  
people also zap like to change the channel about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use  
uh because if we make <unk> covers it has to be one of those mat materials  
i don't know  
yeah  
then marketing strategy of the company  
okay  
<unk> weeks  
mm  
so that's why i guess we don't follow that solution  
which you can <unk> so you can uh still put another number on it  
or not  
okay  
yes well we'll get it to hear that i think  
yeah  
so it would be nice if we have one for all  
so the re basically the remote control will be you know infrared control so the problem is how to relate the  
should we leave now brian  
yeah  
export  
no  
uh but uh yeah  
yeah but do they automatically write to the file anyway i'll i'll figure that out  
or i dunno  
okay um  
uh i th i think yo we have to keep it simple to get a whole market  
right  
um badger  
mango  
i don't know  
and if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material so we just have to take that into account  
no that's a that's a catchy slogan  
i made uh uh my own map  
yep  
but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also <oos>  
what would be a more efficient way of doing it  
and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote what we were saying it's a common issue  
if it was damped lyman alpha absorbers that would be different  
uh as i'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this  
but how often the lounge is used um  
so you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video  
yep that's right  
and so with fire wire we are sure to have a um an acquisition system  
okay  
so we keep the curve  
yeah  
but when you use a <unk> a <unk> remote control that doesn't sport these buttons it still works  
so <unk> <unk> textures yeah  
okay  
i mean the stream  
our remote we do not want to make it p. d. a.  
okay  
okay  
but um i i was talking about really the design of the  
eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote  
yeah i yeah all these standards are really okay  
yeah  
so we should put uh zap buttons on it  
so you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is <oos>  
well i i did single curve to well you said <unk> double curved uh he because uh i thought it's a <unk> a bit cheaper already  
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  
well  
so i think we've done a lot of talking about that just with lighting and the buttons and the  
and from there it signals a morse code like signal to the to the <unk> to the bulb in uh in the television set  
oh right  
<unk> what f. do you have to press five  
right  
yeah  
because i don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it  
ooh that'd be good  
yeah  
um  
like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels um and here one for for  
little bit more for comfort yeah extra features  
they're they're both sort of track based in this way  
yeah yeah yeah but furthermore better  
some <unk> uh <unk> report  
uh not sure <unk> uh  
mm-hmm  
the th not to have not to have it done but just to talk about how it could interact with automatic dialogue act segmentation  
so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also  
then you have a couple of seconds no i don't think so  
but then um other <unk> um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then  
but uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television  
research i have here is on fashion style okay which as we've agreed is a priority  
okay so you are the expert  
<unk> may or may not be the case  
otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell  
it's that same charger that you can use for the hand phone but uh again depends on the types  
maybe we can  
depends how much how much movement it really needs  
and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um we're gonna have discuss the functional design first  
um i don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of  
but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros fifty um is that a lot or a little  
yeah  
so it for uh in previous discourse studies uh especially in discourse analysis exchange uh is used to describe this kind of uh local structure  
big and clear  
but then we can add the special colour  
so the only thing better than um a banana shaped remote is one that you shake  
yeah yeah  
so we should also be uh look at their uh trends  
but <unk> 'kay look what is the uh if you make it double curved it costs one euro more  
terrible  
these are not our target people  
um i'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails  
i think tho i think if you're gonna have a <unk> then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons  
okay  
do we include it and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh  
yeah  
alright  
so i  
no no no no no  
removing the l. c. d. um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look  
harder  
yeah okay  
but it probably be more difficult for <oos> <unk> to map for you to map it on so for you sort of i  
oh yeah you do have  
great  
organic really  
but you pay for it  
yeah  
yeah i think so  
where are we  
well you can have a piranha at home  
it's more targeting u. k. or  
okay  
you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose  
or even clear  
yeah they want to pay for it  
in fact the whole thing should be highlighted i think  
i shall close the door  
sure  
i think we'll go with the triangles that come on  
okay  
there this is the three concepts of our controller  
it's two point one seven  
yeah it's <unk> it's definitely more fancier than that one  
there it was  
<unk> keep it in mind  
mm  
we spent a fair amount of time looking at it and it did strike me that for joint problem solving there <unk> there were some good ideas  
okay i'm gonna be looking at the working design  
okay so i make uh <unk> user interface  
okay <unk> so it is possible to use other machines actually yeah  
and the same for this one  
yeah  
yeah  
uh-huh  
yep  
i've nothing against cats  
mm  
well <unk> basically it when when this is our only option we should even consider changing the casing  
team leader  
this is probably one an innovation  
uh-huh  
yeah  
and uh we just have a simple design  
joystick  
this is how today seems to be going to work  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah maybe not co confining  
i'm kind of <oos> with things like this  
<unk>  
okay  
um  
that's  
yeah okay  
yeah  
that would be a nice idea yes  
so first thing which we should take care of is  
yeah  
yeah  
but it seems that trends travel across things  
okay  
um also with um with buttons a thing called r. s. i. so wrist sense huh  
something else we could do is uh  
okay  
uh or depending on your normal email client you might be able to do it but it doesn't matter too much  
yeah <unk> but  
at four it's gonna be too heavy so that that's not our problem  
alright  
there you go  
but but my point is that we mustn't throw away in or lose the capacity of being able to deliver that kind of data  
yeah we only needed one computer and  
it's got the got the the toys in it it's got the l. c. d. screen and  
somewhere  
but try it informally  
so these this is the summary of everything  
so  
yes we've got nothing to do now  
and what does the hand dynamo oh sorry  
at least it  
okay so the price of the charger included in the  
because a lot of um  
mm-hmm  
oh okay okay  
mm of the previous <unk> uh page rank or of the  
dunno  
do you know if it's possible  
it it doesn't make sense  
great  
yeah  
a processor the t. a. one one eight three five which um receives input from the buttons and <unk>  
and trends  
yeah  
half an hour  
yeah i think that's definitely the idea i think the best idea  
<oos> for everyone  
yeah  
for the people to use it  
alright yeah  
what do you say  
yeah 'cause we've a four to bring down  
so it kinda goes up one then <unk> like you can keep rolling it up but it's like like like like a <oos> or something  
uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve  
okay  
yeah  
it's twenty five of d. a. type and six of d. b. type  
yeah sure  
okay then it's carrying a lot of the burden  
uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss  
yeah it's the right shape isn't it  
right  
mm  
at the moment what you would do like to to solve this problem is you would sort of like write some perl script or something that gets this time value out of here and  
mm-hmm  
um how ma uh the colours like <unk> she told  
yeah  
like your <oos> or your front door or like to have everything on one thing  
her name's <unk>  
yeah okay let's go ahead  
yeah well but  
yeah  
what's it called  
and that's the sort of thing once you get the mould set you can just whip out different colours different pictures very very quickly  
yeah  
ah would buy yeah  
why not just give them a week to do the abstract  
yeah yeah  
you can use it just plain but you can  
but people who are about forty ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that  
right  
and what were we doing  
so uh i <unk> i <unk> well we'll we we'll do it like this  
but what if we if we take time as the standard unit for now and sort of like make a massive one segment split super array  
mm-hmm  
and right now i <unk> they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference  
and so essentially say well as there is this silence time which tend to be even more than than how it is  
as far as the uh whole visible light thing we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out why not  
my just that um the feel is that um  
well okay  
well let's do both then  
effects  
um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five euros  
okay  
it's on the side  
like i didn't find it so i did it myself and it took me a day with the formula  
fair enough  
p. l. s. a. can find a hundred clusters that are a good clustering but are completely unrelated to the directory  
technologies uh  
uh-huh  
yeah  
cool fancy  
but uh she'll be uh back tomorrow  
okay  
i don't well i don't know  
a and have you have you tried it  
how about <unk>  
so i can't get them to compile under windows  
it's just to provide advice about this which must take take less time  
mm  
yeah  
it does something weird when you do that  
mm  
cat  
yeah  
and uh another one  
<unk>  
is this one of those media player  
yeah i think so  
mm  
or the hand dynamo dynamo  
okay  
um i don't see anything missing really  
it isn't going to fall down  
maybe you yeah  
you know oh <unk> out we'll have to replace it won't we  
yes  
yeah <unk> i uh <unk> that's what i was uh thought  
maybe that's uh better  
we should make it uh compatible with our new d. v. d. and other <oos> we have our technical <oos>  
the tam <unk> are much easier when you can see  
and uh the <unk> the digital pen  
uh first of all uh it must be original uh and trendy  
hard disk there there were already five hard disks right  
so  
yeah  
okay  
and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did  
so it might be <oos> to put them a little more away from each other  
mm-hmm  
that we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing  
so that when you <oos> over it  
don't blame them  
well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it <oos> me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make  
yeah  
we'll still have the original and a method of uh of filtering  
i dunno somehow i dunno that might be expensive but  
but it's still think yeah  
uh i'm not then i don't want to go too much into details just a little bit  
i think yeah i think also  
as well 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily  
you can't define the difference between information and opinion that way because that's um basically defining as the what happened about it  
okay agreement  
the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen but to keep this as uh normal as possible to keep it accessible  
mm-hmm  
so you just want to know the variability of the of the fixation  
yeah because mushroom was not in the trends  
yeah agree  
well what of people with like the t. v. in their basement like what if <unk> we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably  
okay  
yeah we should do  
say their bit  
okay  
hmm  
i'm sure that's fine  
yeah  
can work together  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
this you will see in my presentation then  
uh  
we're the first ones  
no he will get like every ten milliseconds he get one <unk> one features  
so something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant  
you you can't draw anything uh neat  
do we really need that advanced chip for an l. c. d. display  
yeah  
the the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah  
yeah  
we have to decide  
uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge  
yeah  
yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy but it's definitely different  
yeah  
and then maybe you can find some patterns that are then then once you have the once you have the task  
oh my god  
that's the major idea as simple as possible  
yeah  
um welcome to our second meeting  
does  
that i made  
okay just just do a sum  
alright  
right  
'kay  
well and we can look into this other manufacturing option and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no it's not really difficult  
oh mute  
so  
<unk> i think i high typed high if it's high priority  
i see  
that's right that's a action in the sort of technical sense of meetings  
mm-hmm  
i think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote of course  
yeah  
will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes  
thing is in where is it  
and there's just some little uh clock in the remote  
it'll need a slightly larger uh just because if what you have i is a sort of larger error or of <unk> error margin around it  
yeah  
and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan and uh so we can review that  
so but it's in seconds or it's  
and that's selling them on the international market not just in the u. k.  
yeah  
no  
oh  
okay  
worth looking into  
yeah  
so um i have to inform you i receive an email from the management <unk> board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control  
so basically you would see that the number of points maybe only ten percent of the points you can match well so it's easy to detect  
yeah frequency  
at the same time if it's a dark room it can be used to locate the remote also or  
slap it  
so just yeah i wanted to to be sure  
so that we we take the the ready made parts and just see how we get them work together in the interface the way we want and and then we have a working prototype  
so actually we're going to create a a button less uh remote  
ha ha  
let's stick to <unk> titan  
okay bring out the beer  
yeah a kind of joystick  
i'm the user interface designer  
i think that  
and like on television like i know <unk> <unk> living in los <oos> it's tons of spanish network television if it has english sub titles it's definitely helpful  
three  
and  
yeah again give the phase  
mm  
so okay yeah battery definitely  
<unk> but we will um restrict it to a small uh to have the same display  
so the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart i think up and down  
the channel buttons the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control  
hmm  
but um depending on the context the size and what we consider a document in the sense of calculating t. f. i. d. f. is gonna change  
and uh <unk> uh i can conclude like this that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it  
maybe a remote with changeable faces like the faces that you can buy for phones  
<unk>  
yeah  
oh yeah  
pep <oos>  
uh the mute button  
you're right  
i don't know  
so we are not going to get <unk> all the meetings annotated with that kind of  
okay  
no  
yeah  
i'm seeing five then  
mm-hmm  
we could just go to my presentation  
yeah it's the whole screen  
just making sure  
what they're looking for  
but instead of this i will devise that's our concept  
then we can hope that consumers will prefer these <unk> remote controls  
it's all <unk> goes into their corpus  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
i don't think it's possible really  
yeah  
from ah it's a philips this and this and that and then give the options that are capable the capable from the <unk>  
yep  
function f. eight  
oh we have twenty five minutes for the meeting  
how how yeah how would you leave those out  
if there's enough space you can put uh we'll we'll  
okay  
well th the on the thing is though most remote controls are used by more than one person  
but you don't but uh yeah you don't see it  
so who do you think we're aiming this at  
mm-hmm  
mm the <unk>  
yeah  
sure  
a younger uh-huh  
mm we'll hear about it  
yeah just  
yeah  
no no just sorry this is a standard t. v. one we are not talking about that  
some different ideas we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not  
okay  
okay  
if it was uh i mean th my <unk> is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my <unk>  
he he <oos>  
so  
and i think the temps usually have  
okay cool  
you know what th we're focusing very much on the covers now  
so when you've just got information exchange and you know the or there's a clear task that the people are trying to do and they're focussed on that task  
yeah  
can we leave now or  
uh pretty nice design  
alphabetically  
uh material study i'm working on that um for the the costs  
oh so many things have no function just design  
the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up  
yeah  
i think both  
but you have to go down because then you can get just voiced part and <unk> part  
they have <unk> most of them have teletext  
the field test will tell you how good  
no  
well  
the uh it's made for <unk> people well the they don't if it was uh uh <unk> useless technology they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility  
but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and d. v. d. i could get back to them and see  
it's okay  
this is actually i mean this probably  
and the eraser was another problem  
mm  
al although the standards depending on what standard you're dealing with sometimes it can be quite ambiguous right  
yeah  
very good point  
yeah  
i'll put four  
yeah  
uh well the same idea here  
yeah okay  
i think we have to keep the l. c. d.  
um personal preferences i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal um  
she  
or a very small cat  
we had two groups of people working on this  
uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control start to to have new idea and  
but  
okay but okay  
yeah that would be nice  
uh check they got 'em first though  
so it's it's not  
you had expected it to to be uh more more uh  
and it can <unk> it <oos> out a lot of the junk uh as well  
but le let's go round the table your favourite animal  
say look this is you're doing the wrong thing you're <unk> you're wasting your time now because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford  
who wants to start  
'cause you know people might wanna use this for speech recognition or something  
could be really light or i dunno something special  
that's a lot of fruit  
oh no  
so  
hmm  
you can still keep the same frame rate  
i dunno what you think about but  
yeah yeah yeah  
well it's very expensive  
people uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think well that's the product i i need  
that's the easy to ha uh to to uh  
no  
i don't know about other countries besides the u. k.  
and it <oos>  
so we can we could say that  
ah  
and make all plastic then we ha then we're there  
because if you <unk> lose the l. c. d. screen we need a lot of yeah  
because it well <unk> will rubber actually protect the remote control itself  
so what bit are we on to  
i think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market  
that was just a little formality for us to go through  
hmm  
yeah  
um i don't know  
yeah  
and then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team  
the ten digits  
yep  
mm-hmm  
yes yes  
yeah  
kitsch  
<unk> no um but i think what they had was some big review  
the second important thing that <unk> should be if <unk> in <unk> innovative okay  
uh if you wanna start the next slide  
uh <unk> well there are many things you can do  
okay  
mm  
about a microphone there is no button  
yeah  
oh you've got  
so  
yeah how many of these did we wanna sell  
you know one for the t. v. one for the digital box one for <unk> the video recorder as well  
yeah  
and there isn't uh <unk> it doesn't open up to the advanced functions  
i'm not sure but check the first one  
<unk> <unk> yeah but  
maybe  
uh i don't know  
no  
ah yeah maybe there  
and then you can also look at you know <unk> you know clark on joint action  
you know your job  
okay  
you have to make your own favourite animal  
it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make which seems to  
yeah m. m. m. cache  
oh that's good  
yeah  
that would be good yeah  
and the timing was good  
well no  
uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand  
yeah  
so even though it has a lot of modern technology um for example the voice recognition  
might be interesting to the user though just the word importance maybe  
well that's what i like about uh piranha  
and one  
uh i've never <unk> anything  
mm  
close the meetings after  
uh this is <unk> this is not this <unk> that's not the right one  
no but marius is it's similar stuff  
i would say the <unk> the <unk> the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the <unk> wheel  
mm  
right i really can't see what i'm doing so does anyone have a  
may not okay we can go  
alright we both uh will  
i think the more bells and whistles we add it's just gonna cut into our into our profits  
colours th the elderly people  
yeah  
yeah did you use uh <unk> the x. l. uh x. m. l. parser in python  
okay we need one battery  
that's why we have that button  
yeah  
that's it  
oh right about seventy yeah seventy percent  
yeah  
don't know  
that's just so like to make a list of all this stuff or we probably can somebody can do it on paper  
um  
and at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up  
that doesn't matter that much so make it a one  
well so what what i have here what i've been working on since i was here was m. f. c. c. p. l. p. which is always needed for compressing purposes  
yeah  
oh  
sound button press  
number one product  
i think we did pretty well  
the logo is uh  
so we uh yeah  
you can build sub sub <oos> and then link the the part really yeah  
ah  
there that one there you go  
mm-hmm  
so the question is if someone is moving i'm talking here i stop talking i'm going here i'm talking  
light  
i don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face  
uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with  
okay  
um so  
<unk>  
okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um  
mm  
uh yeah  
i'm stuck doing something else for the next month or two anyway so  
i like it  
okay  
<unk>  
at least if we're targeting the younger groups  
yeah  
so <unk> um i have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh i would like to share them with you  
yeah  
alright  
right  
yeah  
there's no problem with that at all  
but uh i really would like to stop with this because this has been for several months that you say we like we want  
well if you're pressing enter the the thing would already be on and so maybe um when you press power initially it turns it on  
yeah  
nah um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of <oos> kind of things  
yeah  
'kay  
okay so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and  
what is the difference  
so it's still still real time  
it won't get lost  
and uh yeah  
okay  
yeah  
but the one which you have reported means you want to report something more than that  
but then we should move to another target <unk> because at twenty five dollars it's  
well i think that's all  
mm-hmm  
uh decide  
right  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah it's vague yeah  
we can put four  
yeah at <unk> at most yeah  
uh  
yeah  
if you already programmed it  
probably the way to handle that would be to make a summary that's the same length as the selection and that would ensure that the search term came up  
yeah  
mm  
so i there is high <unk> included if you make it with l. c. d. <unk> then when it is without l. c. d. there is not much <unk>  
i assume it's <unk> it's easier indeed  
ne he was re he was quoting  
mm-hmm  
okay  
so that would yeah in that sense it's the same thing here  
um  
so uh the models for  
i i feel i i i think <unk> <unk> will will consider this uh th these things  
um  
hmm  
yep  
walter will uh start again this time  
mm-hmm  
uh i'm i'm thinking of in a sense of like creating a virtual a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting series sort of  
i know it'd be handy wouldn't it  
it costs  
it is sort of <oos> whereas you're just sit at home so unless somebody comes over to watch t. v.  
i know ways of getting around this analytically  
yeah  
i think it's two  
but in that case it's not relevant  
which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case  
uh  
uh  
so we've got uh  
push button  
mm-hmm  
uh you can access that uh via zero and then minus i guess  
but maybe there is a possibility to use a current machine which is only <unk> yeah that's is withdrawn from the network or yeah  
maybe something like that  
although you do need to include r. f. kind of circuitry in the remote  
yeah okay  
it was a t. v.  
i know i know i know  
which also has what  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah but you convinced me  
and which what is that  
mm solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls  
so uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did  
a cat who had an accident or  
i'd go for a three or four on that one so okay let's go for a three point five  
so you have to store some <unk> on the on the  
we could lose the curve  
so how can we define the shapes that people build  
yes  
this is philips huh  
this is an an ipod from apple  
or is it  
sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under  
that might be cute thing uh for uh estimating uh <unk> energies  
sell it  
twelve thirteen fifteen nineteen twenty one divided by eleven  
uh  
i i elaborated on the concept  
uh-huh  
so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present  
i don't know  
so we can say it's it's the product is it's okay  
yeah  
no we only make less profit of it  
yeah  
okay  
you know speech reconstruction from the essentially the <unk> without phase information  
yeah 'cause at the end of the day if it says just t. v. remote doesn't say com combination with all all the <unk>  
alright great  
mm  
we should not do that  
but it is more <unk> that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again  
minor detail there  
mm-hmm  
okay  
mm-hmm  
they uh they wanna do something else  
mm mm mm mm mm  
yeah  
you could <unk> you could put it in a logo of the company  
but it's it's kind of uh it's kind of <unk> organic so that's very good  
yeah  
i mean otherwise i can give you the code for loading a dictionary  
i hope i'm going to try to help you on that  
uh now it's okay  
there are very few uh content uh words  
two  
good idea  
yeah you will have to look that up  
um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product we're looking at making it at a very good price  
so yeah that goes  
we know you'll you'll you'll hate it but  
no  
yeah  
i think we possibly could take a more abstract design  
sorry  
light uh  
and so to me we have to make this a really special product i i i don't <unk> i really have to say i don't see the market niche for this product  
yeah  
well i don't know i'm just  
a <unk> <unk> remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just  
no i will say how do you like to go about with <unk>  
and the speech feature  
yeah  
an eye cute  
yeah probably it would be nice  
<unk> i <unk> i mean i wouldn't know about the costs of them  
yeah  
um well i guess i had the most time to think about it  
yeah  
yeah  
so one plus one would be eleven or  
okay  
of course  
yeah  
the without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems  
so  
yeah that depends on what you want  
mm <unk>  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
are we gonna <unk> <unk> an are we <unk> have we decided on whether  
well we didn't quite have enough material uh  
looking <oos> good that sort of thing  
you know innovative thought with  
bye  
and both gazes are on it right  
uh yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
no  
people are stupid  
mm-hmm  
to prepare the prototype i would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer uh work together  
but only we're measuring one third  
good example  
or is it just one  
mm-hmm  
sorry  
so it's not just for us it's for the experiment as a whole so  
and uh i dunno buttons or or buttons as an option  
uh  
we'll put price up at the top  
do do those calculators yeah  
mm  
so if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button it's uh  
mm-hmm  
like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah  
and you can you can um this way you can filter uh perhaps some range that are uh just very low frequencies for uh perhaps uh a noise or  
it's likely one spectrum in the u. v. which you can see absorption features in  
then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing you add a little <oos> down here  
oh my god  
mm-hmm  
mm  
so that would  
in the battery that's it  
it's diva  
mm-hmm  
no buttons just normal  
yeah  
any um comments on all of that  
large and and and pretty thin and uh and long  
'kay  
mm  
a two  
yeah  
uh for example that festival am i able to put the text to the system and to in real time to listen to the output  
i it's the same as as you have in the picture yeah  
alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth um  
for training say  
okay  
images  
you're pressing the numbers for um for what you want  
and you look at competition and design  
hmm  
you can <unk> those i mean  
nice to stock you know stick your finger in  
um  
yeah  
no not very strange  
but that's that's the big thing at the moment isn't it  
no no no  
or this not hilbert carrier  
okay  
is there a standard colour  
yeah  
hum you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons  
alpha times the maximum of the other ones  
hmm can't you then just say copy  
as we know our  
but  
fifteen seconds when you touch a button after having not touched it for a while  
um  
mm  
i could probably get my computer in if i could get someone to give me a lift  
at this price i don't see it yet  
okay  
<unk> or we could like take off this  
huh  
i'm sorry  
can you draw it now of uh can you draw it now  
oh  
um how are we going to do it with those numbers  
do you wanna  
so for example if you split a document into two parts and said that the two parts have to be close in the distribution  
but here's it's below here also and now here's here's next to each other  
that would be very handy  
it's easy to do you just control the  
<unk> or something like that so we have to pay attention not to put too <unk> too many buttons on uh the remote control  
uh yeah just click there  
right  
i think we get the idea  
yep  
if if utterances are split over three or ten or <unk> hundred different files  
although you don't turn off the video on your t. v.  
because you have to <unk> <unk> uh a <unk> yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary  
um were the important themes enclose  
i didn't uh ha i didn't have time to the the real media  
as your favourite it's like to have a certain number of <unk> um and that <unk>  
as you can see this is the same tool bar uh as is located here  
um let me see  
and not choose with uh this kind of uh and you could put in a an a really <unk> little <unk> device on the side of your uh remote  
choice of material yeah  
or eventually yeah someone can say okay now this become your priority  
um that looked like it was coming up rough but then once you get used to it it does make a lot of sense  
yeah  
yeah  
this is <oos>  
there's no <unk> sort of restrictions on that  
just gonna make i'm making full minutes so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that  
he was not using using doctor speech  
if we use the uh  
i dunno  
okay  
yeah  
well let's start  
manufacturing and uh  
uh-huh  
yeah  
<oos> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up  
yeah  
is it again like uh one hundred frames or it's less or even if you keep variable length of the frames right  
you're standing in front of it i can't see it  
but to me it's it's about a choice do we follow their <oos> or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss  
yeah  
oh okay okay  
um one of the examples given on the <unk> was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a v. on them  
i turned the page  
<unk> she's been volunteered  
the basic word importance is off line as well  
yes  
yeah  
mm yes  
well that'll be something to do  
yep  
okay  
did you type that  
yep they're called um <unk>  
if they were white they would glow probably  
so  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yep  
i think the buttons yeah but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button  
so it meets i think it meets more the young people than the older people  
no we are evaluating this this uh design now  
yeah  
that's uh strange  
it's a two point six  
but uh maybe the boundary will not be exactly the same  
mm  
i guess that's that's enough  
the thing that you're dumping them onto just starts running with the flash and the bleep  
mm-hmm  
right  
but um it's not very clear what is the colour of the <unk> the <unk> the case  
okay um th  
but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface  
yeah right  
and do you have anything do you have anything to say  
it's a good idea  
um  
okay  
you can't  
so so we'll worry about it then  
but i think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull  
but you think here or here  
yeah  
well i don't think yeah  
mm-hmm  
so you can touch it with your hands  
because now we're doing it all by hand and like parsing and un parsing that thing and it's it's all part of the framework  
wait there's was one thing i wanted to ask  
right  
well any case we'll discuss it now  
yeah  
double curve yeah double curve  
oh it's a one  
any uh in any case they are simulation no real data  
let's see we can save this now  
so you just treat 'em as independent  
sample sensor sample speaker  
so maybe i can put six to seven  
yeah but but that's optional for later i guess  
okay  
oh  
it's actually really um after you actually model the <unk> a spectrum not just actually looking at the spectrum  
yeah  
but actually dave has written a whole underlying different structure now and if we hooked it up with my display  
yeah  
yeah  
just write out triple like a word triple r. c. triple <oos> oh  
so you're going to email claire  
okay  
you're doing so that's that's the role of the checker is to check what's said in the silent regions uh in the speech regions and then make sure nothing was lost in the silent regions  
so very simple one could be one person is talking  
so um how you gonna get your complexity ratings  
well  
so is it okay  
uh the it may be good as a c. v. for you but then as a thesis you will have problems uh defending it and all those things  
and um  
okay  
uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current  
um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right handed people than for left handed people  
well they might have the folk wisdom on the complexity right  
there's there's quite a bit you have to comment out for that which is stupid because i  
we <unk>  
oh uh i'll i'll give it uh a <unk> a two  
right  
and that won't play any surrounding segments  
and did we say plastic  
yeah so one  
no  
but people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote  
i'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh <unk> uh you will do some trend watching  
yeah but <unk> uh <unk> of regions or systems is the  
of what  
mm  
yeah  
for i for the cameras yes  
uh evaluation <unk> criteria  
so which can report on what is going on there so i would be glad if you can tell me about them  
yes i do  
great  
yeah  
yeah that's right  
could the middle button of the on screen menu function as a power button  
is it fancy  
it hides that yeah  
maybe having the <unk> images be specific like you could choose your menu bullets to be  
we have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore  
we've all broke a remote control <unk> um <unk> yeah  
but i think the thing to do is um for you to go away and think about it this way with the different tracks for the different objects and the um the kinds of things we've added about whether they're looking at the other person's gaze and what have you  
this is a frame number this is in second but i i kept the frame number  
so  
okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
okay good  
that's what it would be i think  
well i'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no i don't think we do either  
yeah  
well the maximum  
right  
new page  
mm-hmm  
that's from my manufacturing division  
you can make a trigger button or something like that  
ah okay i see  
was there anything in your research  
okay  
i took to mean that they just they use it a lot they use it regularly rather than standing up and  
alright so at top i don't know if you guys can read that or not  
you know you could have some kind of neat little you know a sexy design for <unk> a cradle and the remote itself  
jesus  
i don't know  
okay okay  
yeah back to work  
so yeah  
yep  
that's uh you're right  
indeed  
i think they probably are  
okay  
no but <unk> le you see you've got okay the energy that's one thing  
and nobody is modifying that data at at on line time at all it seems  
thin  
is the is the software par <unk> okay  
mm-hmm  
so  
if they ever come out with potato  
uh i think yeah yeah  
the yeah the main is browsing  
okay  
in terms of uh ho how much we <oos> to the <oos> of the uh market place  
oh <unk>  
a hundred  
it's a new requirement  
like a banana but that isn't actually <unk> as a banana you know with the <oos> and the stalk and stuff so  
mm-hmm  
well done  
so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things  
um  
yep  
you wouldn't mark the source type  
sharpness  
i think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions pads and things on the <unk> uh side  
yep  
and uh going to the last slide  
it's still probably even that angle  
<unk> <unk> should i list it  
mm  
mm  
well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume i think  
so exactly how many stays for decoding and which kind of language model and things like this  
mm  
um i think <unk> because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen  
and if you think there are too many things that you risk to lose control uh tell it now  
so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable  
our functions we've so far decided i think that power channel volume make it attractive  
i like there is some hope that probably having just sentences where there's lots of very specific words  
yeah no or maybe session of five minutes together or something and then work separate  
exactly right  
yeah maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um  
right  
yeah  
yeah okay  
but i have uh a introduction how it works  
yeah this is actually two curves yeah  
so if people just go somewhere to sort of relax and  
th that's my first idea <unk> was how i set this i remember for the lotus thing wasn't there  
yeah  
is it a  
right  
it's the length of it really  
mm 'kay  
it's oh it's very cheap  
but sometimes it's really difficult sometimes you really don't know whether they're saying will or would  
i mean  
uh no  
so um it's a bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday you know  
mm  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay  
um and for the circuit board again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote  
so it's very very user friendly and it's got a little <oos> of colour  
yeah  
it's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls  
and what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell  
so i'll just start it up what we have now and then we can talk about what different people have and stuff  
yeah yeah yeah  
yeah  
uh big keys may better for them actually and uh  
okay good  
we could make it yellow then but  
and they have to do it an to do it anyway  
i think so  
yes  
but it's not really you need <unk> you don't need to specify at each point it's voiced or yeah  
yeah  
ah <unk> yeah but we don't  
hmm  
false  
and then we'll move into the project plan do a little discussion and close since we only have twenty five minutes  
yeah  
mm  
like three or  
i think this is not good  
yeah if you <unk> if you go to radio or or yeah  
that's uh  
maybe it's too much you know  
so if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use  
and um we can make special features  
yeah  
okay  
and it should be really small and  
yeah i'm not  
how is that  
yeah basically th i think just do your best and hope for the best  
well  
um will people  
oh great  
because i um i in my outline i talked about um using the um discourse acts first  
uh the tho those do or those don't  
yeah  
yeah  
at least now he can know a full system setup from  
then when they look get <unk> i i i know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control  
well  
yeah  
you have to set them <oos> them to everything  
everybody hated him for <unk> uh temporarily  
this is l. p.  
we can offer options for casing such as straight curved double curved you know very specific to the customer  
yeah it smells funny doesn't it  
now we're we're on the <unk> now  
so um perhaps um our logo on the bottom or wherever you feel like it would look good  
uh-huh  
<unk> yeah  
yeah  
that can be like the turbo banana plus plus <oos>  
but to  
just to set us apart a little bit  
a  
uh but i have some points  
uh  
like a power fruit  
okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff  
mm-hmm  
mm 'kay  
anyway you will receive some messages  
but um i mean that's definitely one  
that's so you can publish only once in three years or  
yes possible  
from the video with a time stamp it outputs a j. peg  
yeah  
and then  
yeah  
i <unk>  
do you think it's easy to use  
it is possible but well if it  
like they are they are a super unit  
then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons  
and then they can't find it in the room  
yeah  
okay  
oh it's better than your bird  
swordfish  
so choose a colour choose a pen width and draw a  
so then the double r. will be our our  
like a like a <oos> or <unk> or something  
but you should be careful people are sometime becoming problem  
i think we can put on the here  
expensive buttons yeah to make some new  
oh you know this is the head set mic and i heard something there  
<unk> so who thinks the the l. c. d. <unk> display should be i should be in it  
oh yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search  
i hope not anyway  
when a users using a remote control he or she <oos> the buttons to be in certain places  
the previous uh discussion  
i i guess if we leave the if we leave this one out um oh  
oh yeah yeah actually that yeah that's true so that it's easier if you  
yeah  
uh  
uh  
yeah <unk> one  
i was thinking about that  
we're just gonna keep using this board all the time so i think it will be it's very clear for everyone i suppose  
um we have a way so um i don't think i should get into details  
and i mean l. c. d. is well <unk> i know but it's <unk> it's less um <unk> standard than than  
mm  
yeah  
i think for lefty it's okay  
yep no that shouldn't be in there  
'kay  
we don't really need any other audio <unk> uh functions because it's just volume up volume down  
well yeah well does it have to depend on the television  
sorry  
okay cool  
that's how the  
mm-hmm  
um you've got twenty different devices in your living room you want one <unk> <unk> you want one that'll do the job of all of them  
yeah well yeah i  
yeah  
okay  
i didn't i didn't know that this this way it can crash because i thought maybe i can do a mistake and wipe out the things  
yeah yeah  
yes  
mm-hmm  
<unk> what it's gonna be  
so it it it isn't very important that that it works easy  
with uh the different uh perspectives of it  
and make a list of its favourite characteristics  
what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view  
mm-hmm  
yep  
and you have for like for some time period <unk> the overlap and that period on the f. ones and that period or something  
mark will  
no we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed  
no  
we're point three over at the moment  
mm i was using thirty nine yes  
just uh for output yeah  
yeah  
two  
i don't mind it doesn't really bother me  
i'll get it  
<unk> what i think for now is we don't want to have a remote control <unk> which is wired so uh i think we <unk> we can use a battery for the  
yeah  
mm  
and also usually end up being the words which are <unk>  
yeah  
um  
probably <unk> but i'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel if anyone has anything  
so it might attract uh the young customers  
yeah alright but  
i don't think it's rubber  
anyway we'll take this project in three steps three <unk> uh three phase of design  
um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general <oos> use  
on the other hand i later learned that some students did find the october poster session quite a useful experience  
i i just have my ear to the market guys  
mm yeah  
no no for <unk> nay speech synthesis it's like they give you some data  
rubber material  
uh this is what we made of it  
well these chairs man  
yeah we'll go with that  
well you know i don i don't know how many <unk>  
yeah  
and user that's you <unk> steph for the technical functions design and for marketing the user requirements specification  
um um okay  
um  
so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these say that we have a seven point scale  
numbers <unk> is not really different from like uh a <unk> at least in <unk> we have almost same  
<unk> yeah  
when it <unk> when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and you know  
separate from fancy like that sort of thing  
i don't have the information  
so that's a big problem i think  
for instance um gaze tracking  
okay  
to give an industrial design of the remote control  
no  
mm-hmm  
i'm convinced i'm convinced alright  
do they have do you have trouble doing it  
i'm give it a three i guess  
those are features  
no  
'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext  
welcome  
yeah it's like the second to last slide  
i just um uh processed from your images  
okay so much is clear  
yeah  
yeah so again here we use <unk> and so but definitely  
yeah okay  
yeah  
but that will bring extra <unk> <oos>  
uh oh actually no we'll <oos>  
oh six  
so <unk> that that just is a kind of thing which is so simple  
so and it <unk> and it will be a little bit new and interesting  
well i guess really i mean like alternatively why don't we go for the simplest thing and just create three scripts or two scripts which load a parameter uh <unk> common line parameter  
how am i gonna do this  
so let's go back to our laboratory and  
uh that that's <unk>  
so the yeah the move uh but you can still click on the segments and that'll still work won't it  
yeah  
yeah  
and simple  
if it was change my remote control of my d. v. d. player for a <unk> banana then i would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh i'd say a three  
so you know how zero is t. f. i. d. f.  
yeah  
how good is it  
uh yeah  
and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um and as part of this  
yeah  
yeah it's the most advanced  
no but i mean like how how jasmine does it internally i don't know  
yeah mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
what will that be  
yeah  
right  
uh keep them away from other channels  
what are you going to <unk> talk or to teach  
so long as our company's logo is <oos> <unk> in the same way as that with a like a black outline  
um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu  
no  
oh  
yeah  
yeah  
so  
um  
yeah or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery  
it's working  
or to <unk> it yeah  
i mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all  
no but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used  
yeah  
sixteen kilo uh sampling frequency  
yeah  
yep  
fancy  
yeah that's right  
what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user  
but one of these big <unk> has a list of stop words that you can download and they're just basically lists of really <oos> boring words that we could filter out before we do that  
yeah  
uh well i don't yeah it's i i just see it as different  
yeah  
uh market potential by me  
okay  
but uh yep  
what do you mean always  
hmm  
well some of those buttons though are blue based  
oh  
<unk>  
<unk> ho <unk> is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower  
and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high tech side we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands  
yeah  
yeah bit of <oos> and stuff  
yep  
but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same <oos>  
i know it's probably like um  
it's getting  
okay  
mm  
i know personally that would be a very attractive feature is to have a uh have a button i can push to find my remote control  
um and and normally you only every use you know on a t. v. remote you only ever use  
um the user interface designer that's for  
i mean they've got all these sort of you know  
so did you manage uh  
no okay  
i mean do you want the whole thing yellow maybe like yellow and white do you want something  
does anyone object and and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go  
yeah but <unk> what kind of menu  
okay  
this spongy fruit and <unk>  
so it sounds  
oh does it  
will talk about some  
the remote control is designed for people with age below forty  
you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing  
do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now  
where should i put the microphone  
and back lit buttons  
yeah that's a bit weird  
i <unk> think you know me yeah  
okay  
yeah thanks  
or is it also for other company uh for other televisions  
okay  
cool  
strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be <unk> and now that's the second thing it has to be it has to be technologically i innovative  
well so i heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the <oos> of the thing  
but i mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours  
but um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price  
mm  
um this one is known as the potato uh it's  
not very complex commands but easy commands so  
uh titanium i <unk> i think uh  
but that  
but we are uh targeting a place where we don't know i where it will be more flexible  
okay  
okay because i mean that's that's the example <unk> <unk> presumably that's the best example of overlapping overlapping areas  
so  
otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company or  
we got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that <unk> the message that sends the the message to the receiver  
mm  
yeah eight euros yeah  
yeah we have moose and we have <oos>  
so applying that uh absolute uh absolute operation you get a hilbert envelope  
yeah as a a one or a two ma uh at least  
um  
um so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use  
it's bigger than the average mobile i guess  
well  
uh channel and volume are the only ones that  
and maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control  
in fact we have uh also a master slave architecture  
and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no l. c. d. no voice features  
and we were interested in around what di do you want  
yeah  
yeah yeah is noise  
oh let's just go for a lithium  
more sort of um  
please next slide  
so just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process  
notebooks and <unk> uh <unk> note blocks and we have here a  
it's the last thing was in <unk> response to the thing i was saying last week about the <unk> being the wrong way around and uh <unk> from the model builder to the actual yeah  
what is that  
yeah  
there are many things we would wouldn't at all  
would prevent us from having too much mistakes in it  
mm  
or taking a week off to recover  
so someone every it there was one microphone shared between every two people  
yeah it is <unk> the the handle more ergonomically correct as well  
it misses the spot  
the younger people said they wanted it older people did not  
and that's that's really uh unique for <unk> well almost unique for every person so  
yeah yeah alright  
so the ones um he mentioned um  
mm uh-huh  
yeah good point  
i mean if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page it's not obvious  
<unk> or you could have it so you on the wheel if you  
this this won't <oos> ab ab you know won't <oos> you for three years or whatever just on this i guess  
yes  
mm mm  
and we could have one here  
i would say an an and this is oh it it should be evaluated  
yeah  
especially those experiments and these uh statistical tests  
um  
excellent  
i. n. e.  
<unk>  
mister ed  
i will show you in shared documents  
yeah how do you call that  
but we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself  
and those might not be the ones that we <oos> as one meeting in which case you're gonna have <oos> i. d. <unk> and things like that  
i mean th th certainly  
yeah  
yeah  
except  
yeah i'm also not sure how we can go from from bottom up  
you could just put it down once on top your t. v. and never have to  
oops  
mm 'kay  
yeah <unk> mine too  
it is uh it knows exactly what it wants  
yeah more through uh like function t. v. <unk> and no no you know what i mean  
mm-hmm  
um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um  
no  
okay  
oh yeah if they under yeah  
mm  
well this this what we're gonna <unk> this is their motto like  
hmm  
we'll go for single curve yeah  
yes  
so like i said click down here just to if you haven't learned that trick already  
the thing which you guys thought to make in a paper  
okay electronics  
that  
i was uh taking into account the for one given slide also the <unk> <unk> slides  
it's it's expensive i i guess  
oh right  
um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control uh <unk> and you type in the page number you want  
yeah okay  
sure  
no  
well hold on  
um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward rewind functions  
hmm  
exactly  
yeah  
well i think that one's just bound to fail  
yeah  
yeah  
well i think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons and uh well <unk> <unk> the menu are clear well <unk> so  
<unk> <unk> it's like an uh easter egg  
but uh yeah on m. m. m. <unk> now we don't have such many videos so  
good question  
uh line in in line in line ratios is modifying ratios  
okay  
that is possible that well that actually depends on the television but i think i figure that would be  
is it the other shift button maybe  
yeah <unk> yeah <unk>  
hmm  
alright  
so  
i have to say four  
alright well  
yeah i think so  
well we're not we're not targeting older people we should remember that  
i'm thinking more  
you should be able to do it with exceptions  
function f. eight  
okay  
it's a <unk> yeah it's a trade off  
and then it could start to beep and  
thanks  
that's gonna hurt us  
yeah  
yeah  
the <unk> project the <unk> project is a project which aims to do the acquisition of audio video and slide uh for presentation  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yes they can work  
okay so we can just go um  
uh first of all the opening which we are doing now  
or might be it does some other kind of thing but  
yeah  
uh  
like they can't say that they'll be there monday tuesday and half of wednesday and not the rest of the time which is part of the problem  
i mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the  
they picked up the software and they play with the and nets  
'cause it's i think it's gonna be more like the tam type situation  
mm-hmm  
mm  
you can what we should do i think is is make kind of a see through plastic button with uh one coloured led behind it  
like maybe have menu things  
oh right  
you have them i you have them but we'll send you an <unk> mail  
uh no i think uh when it is uh in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder you can show it there  
is being used appropriately in cases of discontinuity um but not in stuttering like i said  
yeah  
are we out of time  
no  
yeah but waits just a minutes  
a <unk>  
you should write it down as a an option  
mm yeah  
you know the pear is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh  
know the people <unk> people's names like when you  
on the remote  
it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form  
but if you take a look for example for a <unk> if you have a very <unk> good music signal  
okay  
simple yeah  
like we we'll we'll have yellow we'll have yellow <unk> and yellow angry faces  
so you would put <unk> in a one person room  
is it technologically innovative  
little uh voice uh  
okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types  
okay um looking at the interface concept it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this  
yeah  
so <unk> strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um  
thanks to the project leader  
so you can still operate uh all the things  
'kay  
but that's all been fixed  
i'll do some research for the next meeting  
so  
yeah  
very nice  
yeah  
maybe you're going scrap scrap it  
mm-hmm yeah in  
sorry  
um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now  
if exchange of uh opinion uh uh some kind of so it's uh very related to thought of thinking yeah  
i dunno  
okay goodbye  
but it's actually <oos> and all the i um international <oos> in europe all  
um and basically it's uh words that are uttered in a sequence without pauses  
a good little object  
oh i see right um  
i mean this is a very <oos> way of doing it in some sense  
i thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour  
okay  
no  
well you you've well i mean you've got a bunch of options haven't you  
now you can move i think yeah  
there we go  
yeah  
and then of course any problems that remain you <oos>  
well we we tried uh many knobs to tune on th on that  
but it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made  
mm-hmm  
but but uh what i'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people  
yeah  
ah okay but but not much yeah  
oh your computer  
it's um no it's a button that you press and then you uh like a menu pops up  
no i  
um there are the decisions we have to turn to but we'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the  
or is this put his schedule back  
yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that  
it  
on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll  
i say five  
uh again it's a fair price  
in our uh factory  
yeah  
yeah yeah and that would be really annoying  
it seemed to me that he was saying that everyone would do it <unk> because its goal was to give the new in take uh idea of  
yeah  
alright  
although computer parts all if you're gonna upgrade your computer buy it in the states  
yeah  
i don't remember anything like yeah they're doing yeah <unk> yeah the even even g. even normal g. seventy nine normal speech <oos>  
so of course this is will be a team work <unk> we together have to decide <unk> what rating we will give to this product and everything  
and um  
mm-hmm  
whether any monkey business has been done around the blinks to correct for that  
yeah why not  
uh-huh  
i don't know how it works  
we don't have any push buttons  
like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and i uh i tried to facilitate it without like taking over um  
i want to i'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that  
we should perhaps  
um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple so i'm gonna give it a two  
so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house  
play with play dough  
so now the technical aspects of this new device  
bright but not too bright  
but probably uh he should run it i mean to say  
um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch  
yeah first they started in c. s. t. r. with alan black and paul taylor then then it expand to many places  
we don't  
mm  
yeah i know but uh  
<unk> what connection do you have at home  
right  
there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose  
yes  
so can you um  
mm-hmm  
with a touch screen for the basic functions  
okay  
line again  
we did yes we did good  
what was the other one  
push push  
it's better than <unk> i think than a serial number  
uh but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right  
yeah because i have <unk> g. m. g. m. m. <unk> and h. m. m. <unk>  
yeah  
yeah it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there so i mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well  
but segmentation  
we need the infra red transmitter  
yeah  
um well what functions do we have to decide on  
for a big team of artists  
mm-hmm  
so this is one which one is this one  
i suppose so  
and a and a <unk> and a speaker information yeah  
okay  
and you were talking about comparing what with what  
but we want the line still  
mm-hmm  
oh  
yeah that's what then what he has to find out  
no  
yeah  
well  
she said i i i she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and i really i think it's true i did get i i felt like i got way too into it  
so you can get some some results anyway can't you  
so it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television  
but if you you put a three on it uh just figure well everybody knows what i'm knowing so they'll all just put a two on  
mm i mean you <unk> you can easily remove the frame  
or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you <unk> you press the button help and maybe you see the the user <unk> might in the in the t. v.  
so we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked  
uh i don't know if uh voice recognition of an uh such a stream is uh real  
i mean it's the sort of thing that i mean you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume  
re rechargeable <unk>  
no it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want  
which is the most common used uh function and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb  
yeah  
just copy the one on the left  
no i've well i showed it somewhere  
you have the wider section for the main controls there  
not really  
like no not uh not seeing it but lost it in the house or something  
so we have to take decisions about the component concepts about the energy  
no  
actually uh you can <unk> perhaps just uh just  
there we go  
we put the fashion in electronics  
or  
mm-hmm  
yeah he's going to <oos>  
but it's a very strong material  
no but my screen is reduced in size  
then uh  
yes you are  
uh what el uh well i'll have to get to grips with <unk> <unk> uh properly uh to generate a little sort of <oos> video i suppose uh for instructional purposes at the beginning of the experiment  
uh  
kinetic energy it needs i don't have too much technical information on that yeah right  
is that somewhat similar to what we want  
yeah yeah  
fine  
uh remote  
if it's do able we can do  
so i'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market about um yeah what people think  
whatever  
but then if you use a full it's too much  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether  
yeah may maybe something like this  
but  
you press something you get a response  
no i think it's coming together not bad at the moment actually  
yeah  
more of your presentation because i think there are lots of different candidates and you certainly can't go through and mark up every meeting  
uh <unk> this remote control will stay a prototype  
oh thank you  
you have to see it  
uh the most expensive  
yeah  
three and a half  
about um frame grabbing  
it's the siemens uh c. twenty five i believe it's it's the one the post bank uh gave away the very  
mm-hmm  
it's a very strange interview feeling as well because you can't see them while you're giving your talk  
yeah that's that's the basic idea  
so he got so he supposed this so this is suppose se segment one and this is segment two  
anyway  
add it copy page  
course then it's it's like the rectangular again only with a couple of <oos> out points  
yeah it's the marketing uh angle on television  
or at yeah alright then  
and then you list a few and i will choose from the list  
yeah  
i think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look  
or or <unk> what's something harder  
that's true yeah  
into one  
is that alright now  
hmm yeah  
because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons  
well that depends on what the energy is needed  
mm-hmm  
for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they <unk> they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons  
hmm  
it's only this slide  
we have one new thing uh discovered  
okay great  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
no that not now but so  
yeah okay that the target group  
<unk> oh i hate these things  
'cause we have three design steps and in every step i have a <unk> specific task to perform or whatever  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
where  
can you go back one page  
did it come out  
yes  
uh it needs to be sturdy um easy to find so we gonna have that locator function  
you know but then then only it makes some progress this  
so the skimming can work on that because the skimming just sort of sorts the utterances and puts as many in as it needs  
no  
see you in  
that  
totally  
'cause i am not very sure plastic titanium or whatever  
yeah  
it's better in  
i don't yeah i have no way of knowing yeah  
yeah  
more to your own personality or or house style  
<unk> some  
ah we don't need it but it's uh it's design a design thing  
uh-huh  
now i have to change the line width  
no have some quiet time and that's where it came from  
yep  
checking their own work  
um  
uh how how about the energy  
and i'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it  
aluminium for battery <unk> contacts integrated circuit which consists of a diode transistor  
yes  
have we got enough to be getting on with  
works for me  
yeah  
uh  
or maybe another meeting  
but they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals that don't look like that  
and we are thinking to use uh lapel microphone you know this this thing  
like for <unk> i wrote something that counts the the different occurrences of all the tags um  
i dunno  
um i don't think they would really need to be  
you find out information  
no  
yeah  
yeah side of it  
okay  
on something on the image of it  
in the middle in the  
okay alright so let's have a look here  
yeah  
um  
i think it was another colour and it was like i think it'd look okay  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
or you get it  
so we want probably want to take a threshold at least of fifty or sixty just as a looking at that  
okay  
no i mean  
when are you planning to finish your  
why does it need to be classified into like different segments  
well it's both a <unk>  
yeah with with an l. c. d. screen you can  
hmm  
then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily  
mm  
teenagers and families  
just uh  
two  
yeah i think of in the end ideas that can be used sadly  
'kay shall we wrap that up  
yeah  
yeah maybe not so hard  
they're pretty fragile  
mm  
mm-hmm  
mm i know  
which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down which may be for the volume  
blue beagle  
and we can use this pen to perform  
mm  
and uh well for the idea i've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people  
mm-hmm  
i don't i don't see the point of that  
but i have like a you know obviously my <unk> not made of rubber  
that's uh  
the speech <unk> is a add on module  
yeah  
mm let's take that out  
yeah but we <unk> we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts i believe  
right  
or regular chip  
or banana shaped  
yeah that's true if you uh yeah  
so it was a a good point for you  
those are the commonly missed things  
tried to keep it simple  
yeah  
at least i saw some  
the project  
i don't know i can switch with him and we can put him and nancy together  
for switchboard yeah  
well there <unk> should always be a menu but it <unk> can be very short  
and um just a clarification before we finish this  
a spongy material to be used on the on the outside  
mm-hmm  
interface oh the interface graphics for the um  
and special colour  
yeah  
again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an <unk> one again because this is a. a. batteries you can choose the types of battery you want  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm or titanium  
so again if you change this shift the mod the <unk> the modulation spectrum <unk> frequency changes for each window  
i might go as far as two on that  
and if you watch t. v. outside it's very useful  
um  
yes it's okay  
and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down  
they make sense only so global <unk> the likelihood is <unk> globally over the whole aspects etcetera  
okay  
oh yeah they're good aren't they yeah  
so i will let you to do your presentation so  
and then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately  
excellent  
so just look at forget that one and look at that one now  
yeah  
yeah  
um  
um i think particularly at the moment 'cause they're really trying to sort of uh merge us into one subject area  
the rubber  
that's true yeah  
but  
i dunno  
but that's the kind of the idea so it lays good in the hand and then on on the side with with your thumb  
bo  
um there's a graphical use where you you look at pictures and  
yeah  
not first change menu options or switch something  
really  
uh  
so you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work  
okay  
yeah i mean i hope it will be the same for the words  
we could definitely include that if we wanted to  
mm-hmm  
mm  
yes  
yeah  
um  
uh a four  
i mean this the language events are multi modal right  
these buttons are uh it not clear  
yeah  
mm  
mm-hmm  
anyway um you'll tell me whether it we cancel this  
like fruit names  
um  
she did admit it  
oh uh yes  
in project  
so uh mm mm  
uh i like the idea of the visible light signalling  
sorry  
beep beep beep  
narrow line region emission  
there's  
um as to where we're going from here you're going to look at the components concept  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
so we could talk to <unk> about that as well  
so we've got new project requirements  
because we you have <unk>  
okay  
maybe it could be instead of pressing button it could be just touching a  
mm-hmm  
it's no not as small as as it should have been but <unk> maybe because of other processing after  
our third meeting  
uh is that uh does our our <oos> say so  
think  
it's it's cheaper as compared to the l. c. d.  
well it's fluffy alright  
uh yes it's um it's on the <unk> uh it's not on the booking system  
so uh just uh something very very <unk> i could uh even uh go to lower  
mm  
so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting  
and there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and d. v. d. there are the mm um video c. d. <unk> and whatever  
and uh perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better but you notice a few things that we've totally <oos>  
yeah  
okay okay well then you just have you have a diff you have a mode switch  
we have yeah several uh interface designs  
so give <unk> give me different files as long as like it <unk> if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them  
yes thank you very much  
oh you mean how long processing time it takes  
yeah that doesn't matter too much i think  
but i thought it was worth before joe <oos> just checking that the model <oos> not restricted to just doing the <unk>  
right  
well so maybe we we can <unk> we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television  
means you say you should say like does that remote control being on or be on kind of thing  
this you do it on a single meeting  
yeah  
and whether it's a sort of <unk> real reaction product  
yeah  
i'm not getting anything uh on my screen now  
um what are our broad constraints before we <unk> design a prototype  
we  
looks pretty complicated  
yeah  
right  
well it's just that when we're creating it we're we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices  
and again this part could be  
yep  
or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the l. c. d. and then do on and off  
it <unk> uh yeah i'm not <oos> about that  
no no  
if we just had all the buttons as standard except for the one red apple then that would take care of that i guess  
you don't need to tune it  
i know but uh <unk> i guess we can do it like several people together  
how so so how does that work how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter  
it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one i can draw  
yeah  
so you only have to choose the position on your  
ready  
so we have to <unk>  
no  
it's a <unk> of of clouds but i don't th don't think if we're including the  
yeah  
but th  
co yeah  
okay we have so i think we can rule out um i'm not sure we can rule anything out  
uh-huh  
looks more like a banana  
uh you're lit i know what you mean with the <unk> p. l. p.  
so that's why i like cats  
okay how can i get this on the <unk>  
um have a little training on tools uh create a plan discuss things and and we only have twenty <unk> twenty five minutes total  
i think we're exceeding now  
of course <unk> doesn't work any more  
no no it has to be um curved  
um sorry  
about the voice rec  
it's quite quite good yes  
no  
but uh if i want to record the conversation with uh uh a processing after th  
and even the shape we have now uh <oos> kind of an r. and the reversed r. doesn't it  
think so  
whether it's the average one or  
yeah  
cool  
we can design the remote control to have access  
thank you  
because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look  
yeah but that'd be quite easy to do  
with those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions  
so  
i have to do working design so uh  
yep oh hundred pound pen  
yes but we can make  
okay  
so i think we can move to the last part of the meeting  
yeah that's my function to okay  
it is it is yeah it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer  
i think we have to come to a decision now just i i think we we what we just do i is vote  
two three  
project evaluation  
yeah <unk> <unk> yeah  
so i th i think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental  
well that that's just it with the covers  
i think i think this is a two personally  
let's see here  
yes  
because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber isn't it  
um this looks yeah  
yeah um i do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print  
who wants to go <unk> first  
and which do you recommend <unk> easy to use with l. c. d. or without l. c. d.  
yeah  
it is optic  
yeah  
whether just to lump them in or or not  
oh you guys are always the <oos> on these projects  
uh then it could be cool yeah  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
i know  
'kay  
okay  
again you know thinking of menus or  
and we're considering now adding something on to the side of the square that isn't attached to the triangle  
oval  
and we're <unk> actually making a better profit than we expected  
yeah  
i don't know how if if i have time to talk about the  
it's th th right now it's only r. r. but uh  
actual  
no no  
okay  
yous know what it's supposed to be  
yeah  
i don't think i can but uh we can try  
yeah  
um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice  
no it's got its little camera in there plug it in  
yeah you can see here yeah  
zero point zero one times an hour  
they are <unk>  
so i figure how many do you need you know  
yeah  
think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose  
so the l. c. d. display is is three francs sorry three euros by itself  
is that price per unit or for the whole  
yeah but how many yeah  
yeah  
yep  
changing fronts  
maybe you you record it somewhere else  
so it must be a fashion  
to your home machine  
with the mouse it is no  
but  
to building a prototype based on this okay  
and i think now it's it's more of uh a compromise  
what  
okay  
yes  
well we've made our prototype anyway  
'cause it i it is very unconventional i like to think of it as unconventional  
it's an certainly a different colour from your average um  
the cool thing about that is that if you've got two <unk> you can tell how close they are  
yeah that makes sense  
lots of yeah  
uh most for most is t. v.  
put fashion in electronics  
mm  
no  
yeah uh channel fifty  
i mean they don't okay  
mm-hmm  
okay  
seven okay  
if you're having ultra <oos> this early on then i think you have to have here  
yeah but yes but it has um you know a basic thing that it loads i think  
so the only your t. v. can understand it yeah identification code inside the  
do we want when you click on a search result we definitely want that one to appear in the summary  
mm-hmm  
hmm  
mm the simple <unk> chip uh is is available uh with the led transmitter uh transmitter  
yeah  
right  
try to  
well second phase conceptual design  
yeah  
so <unk>  
yeah  
<unk> but i di i didn't see where the <unk> <unk> the turn off <unk> turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the  
okay  
uh the case materials  
f. five and i press that again to get it off as well do i  
sorry  
the first one is called <unk> which is developed by <unk> and <unk>  
um no  
yeah totally i mean that was fairly tight anyway i mean especially with that last minute <oos>  
and we didn't use motion features at all for that that's why i we  
no <unk> th no  
so this is what i like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of <oos> in a way  
that was barry  
so we have to change something  
is this for the project or  
mm-hmm  
or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff  
okay good  
you know you can draw something on the sketch board and then take it there or whatever  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah i dunno  
um  
yeah  
you have your hand on one place on the remote control so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb  
the l. uh the l. c. d. is nowhere useful so that would need to be articulated  
um i think it'll be the mid range to the high end market in terms of people  
yeah  
yeah  
yeah  
but it but it's only right handed then  
i think so too  
um  
we're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel  
i mean i think i think it was useful going through your expectations about this  
um i think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons  
last week  
um we could use solar cells  
let's go on this was just a  
well uh one example given was this so um i assume they just want something <unk>  
well we we do have a wise board so i'm not <oos> that  
mm-hmm  
it should be separate  
otherwise the project becomes more complex which endangers the time <unk> <unk> ma uh the time to market  
you don't need the power button  
um what i found out was that there are quite a lot of things without without <unk> time stamps in the beginning  
yeah  
yeah so i'll try and try and get <unk> up and running so i can try it out when when when we've got her coming in  
well you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned  
uh current colour  
but you you want okay  
but it's that that's for the comfort  
that that's a target within the target region  
sorry i discovered clip art  
um 'cause one thing i'm thinking about is <unk> we're looking at the the part building pa type stuff  
ah look  
uh  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
but  
so yeah  
mm  
'kay  
yeah but that only works that at the moment isn't done through our system that's just done because then the time changes  
hmm  
and then averaging it over the utterances  
one curve  
<unk> aye  
okay  
so i just didn't  
yeah yeah  
yeah anything to do with objects  
mm  
thank you  
l. <unk>  
so that's kind of the global thing that ties together other things  
well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh  
it's with the images i gave you or okay  
yeah  
um yeah  
yes  
yeah  
yes i agree  
no it's a giraffe  
yeah but  
so like i i was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting and yeah  
and i have another page i don't know where it is  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
okay so th th what about um room for creativity  
just compare uh  
okay and right now the i. d. and u. i. d. you two are going to work together on a prototype using <unk> clay  
okay shall i start  
uh there's um screen  
um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
mm  
don't really  
there'll be a zillion tracks  
uh  
like if there's some name of some conference they would could probably say that name of the conference quite often  
um  
uh where was it  
so uh we might add there a lot of uh features  
are we taking these off  
whistle tracking yeah  
it's th that's the self destruct button  
huh  
functional requirements  
yep  
yeah  
if you make it a four it will be three in general  
i think it should be more general  
so anyway  
yeah four it's more reasonable  
actually  
but he is he is no good in <unk> right i <unk> i guess  
you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your <unk> but <unk> basically you're looking at the working design  
um i think it must be unless i it  
okay  
so so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things  
what just like in terms of like the <oos> of the country  
and i'm not sure what else but we should check what other things were before this on the list of things to do  
bit more cartoon style  
sure  
yes  
yep  
i think the supplement can be the voice  
so we can tape snapshots  
hmm  
yeah i don't think it's furry enough so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit  
yeah yeah  
but i don't i don't know what to display on it  
i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down and then put the numbers around in like an old fashioned dial shape  
this'll be how it uh will actually work  
yeah  
yeah  
uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that or maybe they'll send  
um so what i ra rather than looking at other remotes uh ra <unk> be better to simply look at the human hand  
and the so this l. e. d. modules are being uh designed uh now  
mm  
yeah  
so now that we know how to use the <unk> um the next um  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
sort of our corpus that would still be from one series only  
and then we're basically <unk> on budget except for you know ten cents  
i believe to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros  
so so the most functional des mm the most important function is to <unk> choo buttons to choose the content  
okay so but there are no time stamps annotated to that  
i just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily  
i think they probably are in the <unk> b. t. g. <unk> and things  
mm  
yeah that's two different question  
a part here  
i'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique i mean it's it's just it is just <unk> um so i i'd give it a four  
mm  
um line again  
yeah  
just a <unk> what are you doing there there sorry  
it it most definitely is it's very easy  
so four point two  
they're all black  
yeah <unk> exactly  
yes  
what kind of index  
next a mo  
you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button  
it's really funny that you got spam in your work emails  
okay  
is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market or what  
yeah i cannot  
okay  
you know it's yeah we did it <unk> it was okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk>  
i think it would be a <unk>  
one is that there's always a cut off right  
well twenty five euro i mean that's um  
so we all got off easy  
right okay  
mm-hmm  
and then uh we can discuss uh some more closely  
mm  
yeah let's say ups  
um  
yeah we have to rate  
the menus uh  
oh it's a yeah  
there's a lot of information that's completely lost in this bag of words representation and i was hoping that in some way you could use that to evaluate this  
okay down to the electronics um section  
i uh  
yeah it shouldn't be too heavy  
i  
yeah  
but as it is now i <unk> would say  
uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these  
yes  
no but no okay  
no that's <unk> that's not true  
mm-hmm  
yeah i understand what you mean  
so but no nobody nobody was using it for anything except it was cute  
right  
<unk>  
<unk> yeah uh yeah we have to because uh <unk> you can see how people have related their clothes shoes and everything with fruits and vegetables  
or is something that you say is christmas two thousand six  
uh it's better than i think  
okay but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way or is just the the signal  
grey  
do you get a pop up if we  
um well this edge and this edge like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it but it's not absolutely necessary  
i'm sorry  
um then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel which was in at the time  
okay  
yeah i mean the position of the screen is also more essential than i mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there  
i put it in the presentation but it's not in the paper  
uh so we come back in five minutes  
um  
uh you know maybe i you're like in maine you went to u. c. s. b. but you wanna say you went to <oos> or something like that  
oh thanks  
where are the  
um well  
okay we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of <unk> <oos> remote control it's gonna be  
and the scroll uh wheel  
afternoon  
so it's not it's enough if you have just this phase and <unk> and the hilbert envelope you can put it together  
right  
yeah it's i'm i mean yeah it's different  
yeah  
like some people use this setup and some people that  
i mean if you think if it's <unk> roughly a million words and nine characters per word sounds <unk>  
the rule was to leave it in was it  
but actually they are not  
yeah then we can have how much for how money is left  
just okay  
it's an option but yeah it's true  
yeah but we should all use the same programme i think  
mm-hmm  
so um well i doubt <unk> do that again 'cause that'll get around  
well that on the ipod for example you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level  
yeah i mean <unk> so in our case basically every  
yeah  
hmm  
uh  
how do you do it  
yeah  
so we're better than average  
well i i i think uh it's the  
doesn't matter  
and uh i've already allocated some some things to be checked  
okay now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons  
and then we did th all the rest of them separately  
well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but <unk> just as a kind of an inspiration  
i informed you about the materials what the interior has to look like and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go  
well it we'll stick to banana or  
ah yeah is it what's it in french  
okay  
mm yeah  
and if you just click that it'll go ahead one at a time  
oops  
what else  
uh  
so why should <unk> we put this function in  
only  
i did  
okay  
oh it does it's kind of like  
<unk>  
and then processing each <unk> yeah p. l. p. <unk>  
and it can be it can be anything  
so uh you've gotta work out how to do that and who to email  
i've told about uh the three first points  
well i i think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the t. v. screen i don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that  
okay so i'll make a note on l. c. d.  
and that central manager alerts everything that's there like alerts the <oos> like the the audio display  
<unk> that's <unk> it's twenty times fifteen it's not  
it does yeah  
but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one  
this cost well to put this into um production we're looking at about what was our goal  
there's a lot of options that we have to discuss  
you might wanna write that down  
we have the technology to do that  
i think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy and  
like there's a lot of um buttons on your remote control and you don't know what half of them do  
the the i. d. and the u. i. d. right um the industrial designer hey right on alright getting into it um  
um that's what i went over and nobody was <oos> to them  
yeah because the the batteries those <unk> last forever  
good  
so i think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um  
where is my mouse  
okay  
right but it's be <unk> <unk> similar  
mm-hmm  
mm-hmm  
i mean i i have a friend who has a p. d. a. that he just points at his <unk> any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so i th i assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world  
yeah  
so first i present as we came to this perfect model and then we'll give some technical specifications  
yeah  
yeah exactly  
yeah  
so the sound thing the sound thing is stands in our way we need to be recording sound online  
it's th they never quantitative <oos> do anything  
true  
so  
mm  
and uh our expected profit will be around fifty million euro  
so that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it  
mm  
well  
wouldn't that um 'cause you've trained on switchboard right where there there are chunks  
you know  
so so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families  
so we can make really <unk> and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power  
yeah  
yes  
fifty percent you're kidding  
so this is a <unk> a lot like <oos> <unk> work on saying what are the different parameters for um these exchanges  
special form yeah they're a special form there in shapes and stuff  
alright  
running around outside as well as being inside and <oos> their food and generally just they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing  
yeah two years' time this will be on the market  
yeah  
uh the user interface concept  
um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually <unk> carrying out  
um right now <unk> uh i'm doing i'm trying to do the uh meeting action segmentation  
so that kind of thing  
it's it's actually a part of your interior of of your design in your room  
i think so  
i didn't use  
oh  
but uh i'll when and out of the output of the <unk> <unk> does does do some of the processing already  
mm-hmm  
i checked over the net it's not the way  
yeah  
or uh yeah yeah  
th  
okay we're doing well for time here  
percentage of  
also in uh this one like in the watches but a remote control can lie on a table for a day  
have slides  
um just this  
look at it  
and we have the feeling that to have the information embedded in the table make it part of the table  
company colour being yellow  
really  
no but  
a menu you go into one menu and then it can have your different options whether you wanna change the settings or the  
um i don't know where the slogan should go or really what the slogan is  
th there there is a distance  
yeah well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes there are maybe um three four hundreds t. v. <unk> at maximum  
yeah but <unk> still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors  
yeah  
you know soft to touch and  
and uh they like sports and gaming and that gives them uh the <oos>  
i mean are they cheap or are they uh reliable  
mm  
so  
uh one thing i wanted to know is any um a good literature on these lines  
so if you keep all the <unk> lines as they were there but you were just uh <unk> with two bits or three bits for amplitude  
yeah  
okay  
okay  
i mean i suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well i i don't know if that works technologically or not  
i'm the industrial designer  
yeah so so a <unk> one is appropriate  
yeah so  
okay  
but then uh you can look statistically it <unk> it will be <oos> um because the <unk> of uh of the difference level  
mm-hmm  
because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds  
okay  
a hedgehog  
okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side it doesn't fall on the screen  
had it as a feature  
didn't you say that the <unk> the <unk>  
not a three  
yeah  
well i like the feel of it i like the feel of it  
maybe yeah  
or lets the user create his own vocabulary  
mm-hmm  
good  
maybe it's cheaper but we have no  
you know audio settings and uh <unk> uh screen settings  
i <unk> uh there must be a new remote control  
okay sorry  
yeah  
so i was just yeah  
so you can hold it  
<unk> just a a <unk> a <unk> a volume and a programme one  
specific  
mm-hmm  
one way the other teletext was there but i guess we can remove it or you know make two separate interface designs  
blue shifted absorption  
yeah yeah it's it's okay  
um  
yeah  
it's a action  
uh do you mind if i draw in black then  
<unk> well nuts that are different colours  
for the anti r. s. i.  
uh-huh  
um  
well  
um it's a spreadsheet of the parts and i've just <oos> put in what it's going to look like um  
yeah  
if it isn't then we cannot reach it  
sure  
from you catherine <unk> your <unk> <unk> you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design  
no the the we don't have a <unk> no  
so  
yeah yeah  
yeah  
so that's why  
okay  
okay  
and everybody's uh like uh using different training and testing data and then you don't know if like  
and then within that create a <unk> create sub folders for the the given meeting and you'll have to get all the sound files unfortunately from the m. m. m. server on your own  
yeah  
yeah 'cause the  
what um oh sorry  
no  
yes but that remote controls are already on the market  
i think so too it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment  
uh  
but across speakers you can't  
but i can't test it until we get the microphones working  
and we'll probably make also a yellow one  
and oh by the way this should be um  
um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting  
yes i <unk> yeah i know that not every yep is an agreement  
yeah  
so <unk> right  
okay  
um i think there are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where <unk> there is no time stamp for the numbers  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
i'd say we're doing well there  
um we could even say something like um you know  
yeah  
but <unk> yeah course but what we'll have  
or do we uh i dunno if we have <unk> <unk> specifically name all the functions we <unk> we want  
well i my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions  
yeah  
no  
yeah because it was it was really just silence and you're asking the person to just get rid of  
so it's um uh about the tourism information  
moving along  
mm just uh po uh pi uh posterior estimated using p. l. p. features for number which i think we can we can rate it  
thank you all  
um there are other ways to do it but uh i think it's it's important because um in <oos> speech all these words are quite small  
um so for the casing uh this an <unk> mail i got from our manufacturing team  
i mean i'm thinking it might be  
uh could you press the next uh  
what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the t. v. speaker  
and maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher so well  
does uh yeah  
but the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the t. v. screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you  
so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button  
i think we are yeah  
yeah  
although it's plastic it's it's grey to to to give it iron look  
drawings of bananas  
yeah <unk>  
yeah  
uh different shapes of buttons  
yeah  
and was <unk> was running  
um anything else  
uh  
uh so the student will be asked to design uh a table  
mm-hmm mm-hmm  
if you control click an utterance it will play where it should be in the file  
um i've  
give you my my it's just it's it's sort of it's a line break separated file you know  
yeah  
uh  
but uh i think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device  
okay i thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of <oos> meeting  
yeah  
huh  
thank you kate  
and then if you take a journal you will have less links and and more documents  
well <unk> three i guess  
and if you get a new document it will um compare which words are in that new document  
i mean but what yeah say what what i'll what i'll plan to do with it then is take the is take to the software  
well i suppose it's rubber as it is isn't it  
yeah it's just anything that's got shoved through the eye tracker  
um  
yeah  
stupid scroll wheel  
mostly focused around the twenty five age group  
so  
between okay  
no no no we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah it's of course it's user interface  
okay  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
yeah  
f. okay  
fine to coarse  
sarah i'm sorry if i <oos> your name i didn't know whether it was s. a. r. a. or s. a. r. h.  
you did  
okay  
you'd want to try and <unk> just have the one product that if  
say if you're right handed you use like this or so <unk> your switch on and off should be on yeah  
yeah  
use the same concept as here keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest  
um so yeah project evaluation is this point  
how how it will be done  
okay  
yeah  
<unk> oh yeah  
so pretty much all the <unk> are from you only  
yeah  
um  
<unk> okay  
sounds good  
um uh in the <oos> we have the l. c. d. displays  
uh something like it  
um  
yeah it's getting  
logo brand  
for example switch on switch off switch the next channel and so on and so on  
uh nope that was it that was it  
right  
and then it's easy to separate the signals  
exactly  
yeah yeah yeah  
okay  
okay  
uh-huh  
f. eight  
mm the thing is the most important things that we have now  
would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing um  
uh-huh  
it's really boring yeah  
it it's not this that you processed right  
i know we should remove this but it won't <unk>  
are we doing it on th the whole thing on the utterance level  
um i think it should be i think it maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever  
mm  
one l. c. d.  
hey you're marketing eh  
mm-hmm  
well <unk> <unk> don't don't uh worry about that just the moment  
well line narrow line  
mm  
<unk> this first  
sorry  
so you're four  
oh no it wouldn't be okay at all  
that it's hard to lose  
yeah  
of the uh of real reaction  
user friendly  
mm  
yeah until the until the beep goes  
okay  
yes if you see towards the top left of the image you'll notice and luckily olivia had warned me it might be complicated  
i know  
yes  
right  
for uh speech recognition  
uh-huh  
see if it's there  
thanks  
yeah  
okay there's an l. c. d. display um i think these are quite standard things  
okay  
yeah  
well five  
and then ease of use was the third most important <unk> so really  
so  
yeah  
yeah automatically  
that's nice  
okay  
that's what we like to hear  
uh well it depends we we could like in some cases we could put it as a feature and say you know you can <unk>  
oh i <unk> if we make it small then it needs to be a little thicker because i need to put all the electronics in it  
definitely in the vegetable drawer  
yeah for some of the meetings yeah  
oops  
yeah i don't see him with ten he <unk>  
new product requirements  
yeah  
uh  
um is it technologically innovative  
you're right there  
yeah if you lose the the back the okay button uh <unk> let's say we only have the four arrows and the menu button  
yeah that's possible but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case  
you don't worry if it crashes afterwards if it wastes all the resources if it formats the hard disk in the end  
the user interface designer can design a menu  
i think yeah  
yeah  
you just have to push harder  
i think i <unk> do you have any um anything you would like to  
yeah  
and uh with different colours uh  
and we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five euros to spend on a remote control  
yeah  
so <unk>  
so easy  
uh-huh  
we can skip some frames  
yeah  
mm uh yeah five frames <unk> you're <unk> the <unk> this already segment so  
can you <unk> it as a bird  
yeah  
here  
um  
you know we're not using that much space if it's just for interim  
i don't think that will do it  
okay  
mm-hmm  
<unk> i mean i i'm finishing off my presentation  
yeah yeah  
and uh the price goes up  
mm  
something like that  
do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it  
you can uh zap through them with the page up page down button  
yeah  
ma matthew  
yep  
but  
you could make it but it's just it it doesn't i don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after  
with a cable with uh buttons on it with retrieval uh device in it  
aye  
okay  
we sell power adaptor products  
or they use the perplexity on the the likelihood to say oh good this likelihood is uh is it's smaller than the other  
hey  
okay so <unk> those are that the hilbert envelope is um is approximated by linear prediction  
mm  
yeah  
just a light on it or  
it's a cat  
oh okay  
what about a button for your uh favourite channel  
i don't really agree actually to be honest  
<unk> yeah  
yeah  
no but you select with the two <unk> the other two buttons no  
design which we saw there  
alright  
but  
and if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in  
the <oos> message that you left  
okay  
go on  
or is it <unk> is it where the is it where the file names are  
yeah  
and um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques blinking <unk> and all that kind of fancy stuff  
yeah it would buy us something  
our profit aim is worldwide fifty million euros  
i'm not sure actually  
had at our disposal and um such  
oh do you need two copies of <unk> to do that  
that went well thank you  
um you can see the circuit board itself  
the the the the programme to programme button the switch to uh two channels  
uh <unk> that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings maybe  
um  
this time it should be both  
i think it's the box that should be spongy <unk> shape  
and even if it does uh doesn't match it will uh people like mm colours that don't match  
well our user interface you can uh maybe uh i don't know what your specific instructions will be  
which i suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again you'd say  
if if we gave them a whole month or just over a month then  
'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see but maybe use a <unk> hierarchy uh structure  
oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones  
so is there no way i can give you the <unk> and  
yeah  
okay  
okay yeah yeah  
but it will there's a a cost of having to go to back up which is <unk> them  
yeah people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t. v. more than uh people who are el uh elder  
bring on the ice sculptures  
so make a click please  
right  
as you said uh what not now but uh the next point would be to use that card with the other card and to merge the slide signal with the  
yeah  
okay so  
yeah but if you look at the l. c. d. you you don't look at the t. v. screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at  
yeah  
okay  
i mean we could make it nice pale yellow  
this is from one channel to  
uh i didn't have a look at that  
mm-hmm  
right we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control  
who's not here and but i think so it it occasionally melissa will all be doing checking of the transcriptions  
okay  
you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use  
let's say that's your standard uh  
yeah  
it's an abundance i it's an element i guess but it's  
i just multiply from here to here from here to here  
and there is no kind of or anything nothing exists there  
yeah  
<oos> sensor machine that uh knows  
right  
no that's that like he assumes yeah sixty milliseconds or something he start with so so then he can yeah yeah  
it is nathan right  
he looks really tall like he's gotta be like six six  
if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message  
mm  
so first uh just to mention i will  
but it it then it uh you can't throw it it  
solar can do that  
uh uh i <unk> mm i wouldn't trust it too much  
mm-hmm  
we can't do anything else  
anyways  
uh-huh  
uh organic <unk> sort of feeling to it then  
mm-hmm  
not quite sure what they mean zap goes like  
uh  
what else  
yes it is  
i don't know if anybody's mentioned this before but you'll you'll know about this with the c. v. s. server  
mm  
sorry let's go through this  
the cost price is very low  
and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high class we could consider it  
so  
okay um and we're also gonna <unk> like your question earlier um whether this is going to be <unk> for television video or etcetera  
or something uh yeah  
maybe we should  
mm  
this is the residual  
um  
okay well that's the  
yeah mainly and to break  
and of course this low part this is the l. c. d. screen  
okay  
yeah too bad  
yeah yep  
and we have l. c. display and yeah  
norman  
um and is there any questions you have that <unk> from last meeting that  
ah yeah yeah  
it's got a direction  
and then they are just like something else that's part <oos> when miles goes over this one it triggers that one to display it or something  
or  
and the menu  
so we'll hear about that later from gabriel  
oh  
yeah  
no no no no  
you can see they can switch form one modality to another  
ah the eyes always ruin it  
right  
so some television respond differently  
okay one two  
somewhere where there's a button but maybe it's a button that you attach to the t. v.  
mm-hmm  
the chip is normal silicon  
so that gave me um now one value per speaker per meeting  
yeah  
oh really  
and probably yeah  
is <unk> it  
mm-hmm  
and um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy save design we should really implement them  
and that's  
want to get the feeling this is a twenty five euro project uh <unk> um  
okay missus  
i don't have <oos> feelings  
so let's see if that comes within budget  
so i don't know if that's necessarily a good thing or not yeah  
very interesting i i leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know  
sure sure sure sure  
i'd give it i'd give it a  
so that being said next slide please  
i mean it really is more in the spirit uh of the r. s. t. ish relations than um than in the damsel kinds of relationships  
maybe oh i don't know  
mm-hmm  
um how many models were you relying on her for  
but i think that they have to be looked at  
mm-hmm  
oh okay  
now a line should be in  
thank you for uh your suggestion and i i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided  
or a two  
thank you  
oh  
maybe i would like just now to talk about the diva project  
i don't know how it works but i guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of  
yeah  
and then we'd have to go back again and then put that back into that segment mode here  
and then we see what what looks good and what looks i think probably it looks <oos> if like an <unk> if every sort of every topic segment has um <unk> yeah  
hmm  
because they're all plastic  
yeah  
mm  
some some preview of all channels and then you can yeah  
<unk> so that might be another reason for not doing that  
okay  
because it's uh  
in your programme  
completely ugly  
and and you have two wheels  
mm 'kay  
so it may not be very useful but because it's new people may buy it  
yeah i think it's uh yeah more expensive  
oh from the time i get the file i can do that in an afternoon the next sort of the next morning  
fine now  
which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you <unk> the <unk> <unk> design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it  
they wanted something that looks fancy and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick but something ergonomically shaped and organic  
um and basically  
yeah if we just had uh  
i think you know if you're going to buy a t. v. maybe a <unk> have that you're going to choose from  
but we all use the same white board file  
i mean perhaps it's because of laughter or something that's what i was thinking but i didn't have  
it's okay  
yeah yeah  
so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control  
<unk> session  
so they they <unk> they don't match what they want to have on it  
yeah  
okay  
mm  
yeah  
however that does sound a bit like the  
they just told me to  
uh but you keep just the phases instead of <oos>  
okay  
but have a component though as such  
if it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it  
i would buy it myself  
we've got a we've got a curve and a <oos>  
we're not well maybe the the the on the side  
mm  
yeah  
i don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder which is for now the detailed design meeting  
'kay  
yes you can put uh a little l. c. d. display on it with uh with lots of information  
okay i think we're gonna have to wrap this up um  
mm-hmm  
um you will receive some information by emails i as usual  
you've done this before haven't you  
um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each  
say in the shape of a banana or something like that  
on our corporate site i saw uh a new d. v. d. player uh we're gonna produce  
yeah yeah  
mm-hmm  
i think one curve is uh fine  
i <unk>  
it's probably easier if you put it on yours and then i'll just email it to you  
oh so there's no two parts with the same shape  
mm yes i see mm okay  
no i <unk> i cannot <unk> think of any requirements right now  
okay so  
well  
yep  
it's just a bird  
<unk>  
function f. eight okay  
uh we only need one of them  
um we are really gonna sell this  
nice  
after that we we feed that into um  
i've finished the meeting now  
okay  
yep  
that would be good  
yeah  
yes so um if we do a version which automatically opens up a file open box  
you know curved look you know <unk> to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know  
mm i think okay we're just on time  
yeah  
yeah so yeah and you have maybe a one image with a um adaptive threshold i think  
we've got the two uh  
ooh  
oh yes but there's no big difference between the traditional controller  
<unk> c'est ca  
uh a bird  
too wicked  
as we have money over uh left  
di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that i have  
okay  
goes into a sleep mode  
so maybe we can start with uh industrial design  
did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of <oos> you to put them together  
so we have the logo we have the colour and we have the fashion in electronics so we have the slogan too  
exactly  
so quite simply if you have a page one which is like a home page  
we don't we don't i mean  
i suppose it could go in  
gonna be visible down the line  
no i guess not  
okay  
yeah  
it's okay  
you then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness  
i think just because it's got a <unk> feature in the phrase  
of course  
but i <unk> <unk> i think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple  
components to use i'm not exactly sure what i will use for the design of the circuit  
<unk> having a water proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath  
yeah  
but that's i don't see why that's not possible  
mm  
yeah okay  
twenty two  
mm great  
and everybody knows what is a banana  
what you can do is uh take just the minimum phase of which you can get from a linear prediction right  
mm-hmm  
what do you like about it then  
yep  
that's <unk> cool  
perhaps i have some examples  
what's the uh <unk> or the website 'cause i didn't  
yeah  
yeah i suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant  
yeah let's see if i can make this work  
so  
he has all kinds of speech recognition results right  
well you can use the scroll wheel as well for um maybe for the channels  
i think we should aim at the young people  
one for the four finger one for the middle finger  
like a consensus right we go around and we think about it  
yeah it's a distinction in the market  
i can't help it  
yeah  
i'm not sure what they mean by that  
yeah  
yeah that's right  
mm  
uh yeah  
depends on the scroll  
uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a morse code format  
right  
so  
um more technical uh <oos> of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles  
yeah they're pretty heavy  
um it might be more difficult to do  
you could we could probably <unk> em <oos> a a side company or something to do that for us  
more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together  
yeah  
and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition  
mm-hmm  
yeah oh yeah without without a doubt  
so that's yeah but that that's not a question  
yeah  
what is a <unk> <unk>  
min uh i <unk> i know i know  
smile for the camera  
mm-hmm  
mm yeah  
yeah you're right there  
yes is now is okay  
yes  
mm yeah  
forty six nineteen fifty seven  
like a c. right now or a dash in a c.  
what does the management say  
um if we  
i think so  
that's no problem  
it's tricky  
so you change colours  
then  
it's not a good place maybe  
'kay  
yeah  
uh the the shape is okay but yeah  
yeah  
so that's something to keep in mind while you're designing  
but there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control  
yeah we probably should  
fruit and <unk> well there you go  
the most used buttons you're doing the same thing all the time and that's just what r. s. i. <unk> all about  
you'd be watching the t. v. and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something  
turn the t. v. on and i turns comes on but it's not that  
that's possible  
it's not matter  
<unk>  
well yeah uh lots of new televisions can store pages you know  
twelve okay then it would be eighteen because uh i uh rated them as uh um  
yeah  
mm-hmm  
yeah but  
uh  
yeah so you for each one you get l. s. f. <unk> here  
um they are often lost somewhere in the room  
and then uh over paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button  
it has fast forward stop play all relating to movies  
roughly  
yeah  
but i think it would slow things down too much  
and it's gonna have the logo <oos> on it uh in there  
yes  
okay  
but uh no as far as uh i mean it  
so you're having the basis station and there is a button if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is  
mm mm-hmm  
then for disagreement i did also but um it's a bit more difficult because there's so little disagreement  
<unk> no no no no no  
ah <unk>  
main bit rate  
they could be plastic we don't have to have rubber buttons because we haven't got a double curved case  
this i was thinking  
you will be except that in this <unk>  
yeah  
yeah  
okay  
well if we're trying to keep it <unk> sleek and sexy as well  
no  
that's impressive  
so we're adding costs for right okay uh i mean i think this is good  
but we weren't going to include <unk> descriptions of <unk> features that were based on fitting were we  
'kay yes  
yeah  
i <unk> i <unk> i <unk> i think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh i'd really want uh because of that fact  
i don't know much about their <unk> or anything though  
the other one was audio settings  
mm  
we don't like systems  
great  
but it's not that fancy  
that's just really good id  
okay  
um  
so that's uh that's a bit of software that's sent and that includes the source code and things as well  
<unk> on the right i tried to play with the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose the number so it's very <oos>  
right um where did you find this  
or how does everybody feel  
i don't know what you have to do  
i <unk> i <unk> any thoughts on that at all  
yeah  
yeah fair enough  
so um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner and uh hopefully we'll sell millions  
so <unk>  
yes well we will then find out ho how it works  
well <unk> <unk> no not at not at my remote  
mm  
rabbit  
yeah  
<unk>  
i was  
well we don't need to um make the the parts are all the standard <unk> ones i had before anyway  
that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight and that a <unk> titanium is very light i know  
no i think it will be more interesting to start with uh  
terribly high tech  
yeah i think  
that's no problem  
and uh a last point but also very important our corporate image should stay <unk> in our products  
alright  
that's very <unk> so  
mm-hmm  
yeah  
so we take that signal here and we move to this uh machine here which is in fact just uh the i. v. c. video card  
have them both up at the same time i think  
so we'll  
these are kind of next generation <unk>  
yeah true  
dual use perfect  
and the characteristics  
oh  
but uh since uh the requirements changed that's uh not a good idea  
<unk> yeah but now now that the guy building these models know that they need to do the <unk> some stuff  
i'm not sure  
yeah so it shouldn't like even if to even if uh if we have to extend nite clock  
does that mean i'm up  
so  
yeah  
but that's okay  
and that's uh also for the younger public  
but it just <unk> it might go back to the last node or something like that  
no  
it doesn't seem to work very well  
think  
okay  
yeah  
yeah i mean it's  
so uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options  
see  
way in middle  
no you don't think so  
yeah  
hmm  
i think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff  
oh <unk> so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay  
no  
is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs  
good  
we will not use teletext  
don't know  
and we have to decide on the functions and on the let's see what was it uh the target group  
um where it calls which one to get you just need to change the flag  
alright  
that is a  
mm-hmm  
so it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone if you have a nokia or like that  
project evaluation  
um unfortunately  
and maybe it will be quite  
because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this  
basic battery  
we have a high quality in slide and we go to low quality to lower quality with uh video  
um wanna make this um selling price of twenty five euros  
<unk> <unk> i'll i'll come to that point later on  
this is it  
sorry  
yeah
