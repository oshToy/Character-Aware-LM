wonder how much of the meetings is talking about the stuff at the meetings 
yeah 
not a lot 
no 
hmm 
okay 
sounds like you've done some stuff 
so 
'kay 
hmm 
hmm 
everything 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
to just have the sort of main same sort of idiom throughout kinda 
so 
hmm 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
but then it's not as extensible 
like if we wanna add more things in the future then we have to well new buttons 
i don't know 
whereas a menu type thing is more flexible that way 
but we're probably not gonna be adding too many things 
okay exactly 
i know i know 
true true 
yes 
hmm 
hmm 
yeah 
actually 
yeah but maybe tie that in with dialogue acts or something as well 
i mean speaker characterisation tied into i don't know 
di just some way to sort of leverage that information 
like we have it we're doing it but what how does it help the browsing 
or what can it give us in the browsing 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
right 
yeah 
true yeah 
is that just from the main main window 
is that is that from any particular window like if we wanna sorta get like if we were on the users versus like topic or something 
have a right click from for these various things to yeah 
right yeah 
yep 
okay yeah 
now it's consistent throughout 
so yeah 
right 
actually yeah like um another common thing 
like if we have it so it's set up that um if you double click and it goes to a default thing on the menu 
i mean that's kind of a typical kinda action that would happen 
if you double click on a particular topic or something then it goes to sort of a like a default view 
so it'll be like all the um cases of that topic 
either whatever we decide the default to be whether it's in all meetings or just in one meeting 
and just show up the the particular instances of that topic in a meeting 
like i'm just thinking to have the default there 
so if somebody knows exactly what they wanna do and we know that that's the most common thing that's gonna happen 
so the double click will do that and so save them the trouble of right clicking and choosing the item on the menu 
well it might come to us as we start playing with it 
um like we have the the right click menu 
you'll have the menu right click it but instead of like have a default double click 
so if there's a de so it'll be a choice from the menu but yeah exactly 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah exactly 
well then they close it 
yeah 
you know it's not it's not the end of the world 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
hmm 
mm 
well yeah 
mm-hmm 
i think we probably need that though to have the f the full flexibility we need to have that there but um yeah 
mm-hmm 
although the thing is typically though is someone gonna have five windows open at the same time probably not 
probably just two or two or three of whatever whatever they're looking at like dialogue acts to whatever characterisations 
hmm 
yeah true 
hmm 
so like have a tab there 
for something like that choose on choose one 
yeah 
oh you should be able to 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah or even just have buttons on it toggle buttons or something on the tool bar for that window 
just something 
a lot of different ways we can do it it doesn't doesn't have to be a tab or whatever 
just gonna be yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
or check marks 
even have two of 'em checked and send yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
true 
oh yeah 
okay 
yeah 
yeah like a lot of these can be like once we get the disfluencies out then we can you know 
have transcript without the disfluency transcript with the disfluent disfluency 
have all these you know 
have all these sort of using the same window and so we can put a lot of and probably mutually um whate distinct yeah 
exclusive yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
right 
yeah that kinda makes sense 
by the end of february 
okay right 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah so we can plug it in and 
hmm 
mm-hmm 
actually is the code accessible like the the gui stuff that you've done yeah 
like can we just like copy like the latest stuff out of your directory somewhere 
or like if we're gonna just try and like take a look or something try and just plug some stuff i think you can if 
well if you just tell us the directory and just make the file readable then we c know the directory to get in then and just 
that might be might be an idea 
yeah 
i think by default they are i think really 
or 
yeah 
okay 
okay alright 
okay 
or you could just email to us 
okay yeah yeah okay right 
yeah right okay 
okay 
yeah 
yes 
lower case 
yeah 
hmm 
right 
um all the searching stuff 
like the the in inverted file stuff and um the next search query and all that 
hmm 
yeah 
so you could probably just use that code like that was behind the question she asked him earlier 
just you know the re using code and stuff was just like okay good 
um apparently 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah probably 
we'll probably still have to do some other file manage while i don't know creation 
messing around still though 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
hmm 
yeah 
huh 
okay 
right 
okay 
right 
yeah it's good idea 
yeah 
mm-hmm libraries 
hmm 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah exactly exactly 
so you're still working 
i see 
yes exactly same 
yeah i mean betwe um i sup yeah 
yeah 
right 
well well you're in s. p. n. l. p. and s. p. two right 
so yeah 
yeah that's where i'm at 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah oh yeah 
yeah that's fun 
oh yeah 
okay 
so 
yeah i was thinking that we can probably get uh start attacking this seriously and then just um 
yeah hopefully have something by next week that we can sorta try integrating into the gui 
okay 
think that should be possible 
okay 
why 
hmm 
well they did say it wasn't the most efficient 
very clearly yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
hmm right right 
yeah 
m yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah seriously on the weekend 
yeah 
well f 
uh um yeah 
yeah 
how many hours is this 
hmm 
yeah seriously 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
that's what i gotta work on 
mm 
who was doing that 
oh really 
yeah yeah 
these can be changed as well 
okay yeah 
um i don't know it doesn't matter 
if if you want to 
i mean it's just you know play around with some extra stuff 
you have some time why not 
hmm 
was that in informatics course 
or oh 
oh it like digital okay 
okay 
yeah 
hmm 
alright 
yeah 
fine 
hmm 
yeah 
i'll be happy when this week is over 
yeah 
well i don't know is that about it then or anything else we need to discuss 
did we wanna meet before we talk to steve next week 
well i dunno 
we'll probably get some work done over the weekend so i dunno if after d. n. l. g. or something maybe just have a little quick little update and just 
yeah 
well we can decide 
yeah exactly 
true 
yeah 
search 
and well sure why not 
couldn't be that hard 
well it'll be you know still limited version of you know the next query search 
but no no 
won't be the whole thing then 
um like we can just decide sort of things that we do wanna do 
hmm 
yeah 
well actually most are just dialogue acts 
and what else was there 
summary topic 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah it'll get behind schedule yeah pretty quick 
like you're saying yeah 
well actually do we wanna set a date for interim prototype 
specifically a date 
yeah 
okay 
is it semblance of reality 
yeah 
i see 
right true 
mm decide on that on over the weekend 
yeah 
right 
yeah totally 
oh just like the basic 
so like no 
sorry 
yeah 
just like all the and seeing the code and just sort of how just see the basics of what you've done 
like just get a a quick look over and just the basics 
yeah 
or like like you know the class paths all that sort of thing 
like just just say okay well here's you know everything's basic in set up and then just yeah just jump right in 
yeah 
yeah 
that's cool 
yeah 
in the morning 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i know 
well thing is you know if yeah something like that could happen anytime 'cause uh yeah 
like my schedule's like a class break class break class you know that sort of thing 
so so yeah i know exactly exactly that's what i'm thinking 
so something like that and then if i have a class i can run off and do whatever 
yeah 
okay 
actually monday monday might be good d um 
yeah yeah 
anytime um not at n not at noon or two or four 
no in between those is you know like one or three or 
sure 
possibly 
yeah 
yeah that's an option too 
yeah after 
sure 
that's fine 
yeah 
or three thirty 
no just yeah 
that'd be necessarily necessarily short 
actually we can't get in there though 
w we well we can get in through the through the the card the card door 
yeah 
how about if we take uh a tour 
yeah right 
yeah yeah exactly 
okay 
just sort bang on it 
actually i was asking steve about that whether we can get in there 
whether he was gonna get us access into the 
the computer room 
yeah print 
okay 
right 
is there a printer in there too 
a nice okay 
that would come in handy yeah 
hey we could we could photo copy our um assignment if we wanted to 
yeah 
well the comments i'm thinking 
um 
yeah that's true 
so after d. n. l. g. 
yeah 
as long as d. n. l. g. doesn't go late 
oh 
so 
sounds like me 
are you 
next week 
or the week 
how 
oh 
yeah 
that's cancelled 
oh really 
um something like that 
i think one or couple classes were cancelled 
yeah 
exact yeah 
i th 
yeah 
i think it was up to the professor whether they did it or not 
well i don't feel like teaching 
yeah okay 
i think yeah 
i think d. i. l. will probably have one to make up for missing classes 
d. i. l. will probably have classes yeah 
yep 
you can have it 
yeah 
huh 
which one the top one 
um 
do you really want multiple windows from a single lap 
but most will probably want to go with defaults 
yeah 
yeah 
you'd be s 
yeah exactly and just the other comment about whether you wanna do both speaker characterisation and topic segmentation 
yeah yeah that's about it 
nothing terribly exciting 
okay 
yeah 
alright 
okay 
so 
okay 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
so what do we need to talk about 
yeah 
uh 
yeah 
good start 
oh i don't mind as well 
this wasn't a good start 
okay 
sorry 
yeah 
yeah 
can you use double click or 
yeah i don't know 
yeah 
and then 
i guess a button button makes a bit more sense 'cause otherwise you don't really know that oh what if i right click now what happens then 
it's like more if it's visual 
yeah 
do you see my 
yeah 
but well we we can have both but whatever 
yeah um i don't i mean it w it's more like part of the 
browsing sort of thingy 
more than the speaker characterisation as m steve mentioned 
um i don't really know how to involve the speaker characterisation into the browsing 
yeah well 
yeah 
i mean i guess maybe we could have that as another thing of like 
well if you get the speaker characterisation that someone s talks a lot in uh a certain topic 
and then if you i don't know click on that topic you get everything that's in that topic or whatever 
and in that way but i don't know 
no no no 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
uh just let th 
yep 
yeah 
like i don't know show the speaker characterisation for instance 
or just i don't know 
but if you do double click on something don't you expect something to happen then 
sort of well i don't know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah uh that was good start 
i don't know 
i guess it depends on the 
yeah what you're clicking on 
obviously 
single channel 
no 
no 
yeah 
but uh well couldn't we i mean you probably i don't know if you wanna have like the the full transcription and the summary at the same time 
so maybe you can just like choose the s same window for transcription and summary 
yeah 
yeah 
tabs are nice 
i like tabs 
yeah 
i don't know how easy it is 
but i dunno but 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
or just i don't know 
yeah uh change the contents of the same window like from transcription to summary 
probably yeah 
hmm 
yeah yeah 
that could probably 
no no it could be like transcription summary like two buttons and you just press on which ever you want 
yeah 
yeah 
i don't like pop ups 
i guess that yeah 
yeah 
he's close 
yeah um well could uh i don't know 
would transcripts uh b sounds reasonable to have like transcripts like maybe three alternatives then 
like full meeting meeting without disfluencies and summarise 
yeah 
um yeah 
i guess it is 
i mean just to try it and i mean for us to to be able to do something that we can include with your thing so so eas yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
just so see the integration works sort of between the different compo 
um 
so i guess that's what we need to aim for 
yeah 
yeah 
well if i guess i mean that was probably our intention but we might not have written it down 
so i guess i know 
yeah 
yeah 
alright 
say that again o. four 
oh yeah 
mm 
okay 
i could tell you what i done in s. p. two 
oh um i don't know 
i basi i s started like browsing a bit just like trying to see if there's anything out there to use s sort of um just 
yeah searching yeah well yeah 
we're doing the 
yeah yeah 
so it just found a tutorial but i inverted search in indexing but i haven't read it yet 
but 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah well i don't know if it's usable 
i uh can have a look th at it 
but but i found some code for like from a tutorial about i indexing 
uh whatever 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um yeah i guess that's it 
i don't know 
uh i'm i was a bit worried about when well when he talked about this with the mm file messing around with files 
i mean uh how much do we actually need to do 
like extracting things from the x. m. l. files and stuff to be able to do the indexing 
okay 
okay 
what are you writing in java or yeah okay 
yeah 
you know a bunch about file things 
um yeah i guess i mean it was a good point you had that like collaborating with the file things 
i mean if you already started on on doing your stuff i guess we can 
yeah 
yeah 
should we i don't know 
meet up and see what we could do 
i mean i don't know see what you've done and see what we need when we know more of what we need maybe 
or what do we need 
yeah 
yeah 
yep 
yeah 
well 
yep 
oh 
um 
yeah we're gonna meet up 
yeah 
'cause it's now 
okay 
okay 
but it what what is it like a window where you have to wr write the search query 
or is it just what's behind it 
so or how does it work then 
d okay 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
okay 
when you like you is there a open thingy or like well what did you two do to like how did you figure out that this uses n. x. t. search like is it 
okay 
okay 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh no 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
i don't know 
oh 
oh 
yeah 
yeah 
that's nice 
sorry 
i'm just being yeah 
hmm 
have we these courses that we're okay 
yeah 
no 
i don 
yeah 
yeah i don't know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
no 
mm 
i don't know 
mine was 
the progress report is due on twenty third february 
february 
um yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
just looking at my own deadlines 
see 
yeah that would be fine 
wasn't like what you had now wasn't that pretty much what we agreed on 
or was it just like that one 
okay 
this is illusion or whatever 
oh mm 
nice thought 
i'm impressed 
maybe you should make it exist then 
yeah 
yeah 
it would be nice to i don't know meet up and uh you can sort of show us a bit what you know already 
so we don't sort of have to do all the work again of just like figuring out stuff 
just like accessing the corpus and stuff 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
yeah 
um yeah 
yeah 
next yeah this monday 
just 
yeah 
it's full yeah 
yeah 
well it doesn't matter for me 
i mean three three or after what 
maybe we ca 
in four buccleuch 
we can go look we can look at now afterwards 
yeah 
okay 
into what 
okay uh 
yeah 
oh is that the photo copier i heard i heard about 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so what time do we say 
yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
okay 
hmm 
what 
it's true 
yeah i don't know 
it's reading week next 
it should be it shouldn't be any well it's supposed to be next week 
it's week six next week 
i don't know 
we have one class at least when we like speech perception we don't have any lectures 
but i think we're having like all other classes 
so uh there's not point in having 
no i think it w 
yeah which are a bit crap yeah 
i think the under graduates had uh all were off totally 
what 
yeah th we will probably have it yeah yeah 
last week 
yeah 
yeah um i guess that's it 
was there anything else 
do anyone know you wanna like take care of this or should i take care of it 
yeah 
i don't know if there was something 
oh i think he basically said 
um the same things as in the comments if i could read it 
can you read that 
yeah 
from a single application 
yeah 
well uh that was i guess 
oh 
no 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and now we have seven percent of the course already done 
is quite good 
so if y 
if you're okay with uh having oh 
who 
yeah 
we're done now 
i uh 
is she still here 
yes you are 
yeah 
yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah 
should we 
well should we just go around and everyone says what they d what they've been doing how far they've got 
well i hope so 
okay 
well i've got a browser now which whoops 
already gone 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
okay 
so yeah 
we've go a browser we've um which comes up automatically with a transcription box and the topics 
and then when you go on the menu you can select a summarisation box which pops up and an audio player 
um and a s i think the search works as well so you could pop up a search 
and it loads up um just the background window is empty and um so when you start 
you have to either open open a particular observation or do a search and open it through that 
does that make sense 
um the transcription box has got a summarise but button which doesn't do anything yet 
um now i wonder wh how we wanna do you know we want a pop up window with the speaker characterisation 
um either we could do that you know when does the pop up come 
either we can when you click on the the i. d. any sort of i. d. in the transcription box 
or we can put an extra button extra few buttons next to the summarise button so that you actually in the transcription box 
but so like you click on a button and then that opens whatever that speaker characterisation is 
the problem is the r the left click is already used because it highlights that um 
that part of speech or whatever that what he's been saying you know the the left click highlights it 
so that you can i don't know what happens when you double click actually 
but that'd be a bit annoying if you have left click for one thing and double click for something else 
um i think so yeah when you left click it 
you can for example set set the marker there so that the mm the audio goes from there i think 
um so we can't put it on left click 
we could put it on a right click 
we could for example have a little menu that pops up 
so right click on at menu you know and you can click on speaker characterisation up pops the window 
that's a good point 
i don't know 
nothing else 
yeah yeah but um i don't know about you but uh usually in windows right click doesn't do anything does it 
it opens a menu 
yeah so yeah 
so but that'd be yeah 
if you just yeah 
yeah 
um or just you know or just the button 
well no no you still have the menu the menu pop up that 
well oh yeah 
it's more obvious isn't it w what you can do 
yeah 
yeah that's right 
that's true yeah it's more intuitive really isn't it 
maybe maybe 
in the beta version 
um but actually what we could do is on in that menu as well we could have an option that pops up a window with all the all the meetings that that user has been in 
like a search for that user 
is that gonna be useful or too much 
or 
yeah so y when you right click on it one one option will be give me all your meetings characterise the speaker 
or is that too much i mean 
yeah 
yeah that's true yeah 
yeah 
yeah that's true 
it'd nice to have it inconnec interconnected like 
or you mean the the speaker characterisation 
oh well yeah i mean 
i don't know about that 
i mean it's the speaker characterisation is a bit like you said 
i mean it's like a nice thing 
we don't we're not actually sure what the user wants with it but it's interesting so why not give it to him 
i i think we should do it 
i mean 
yeah i mean that's that's still another level further 
i mean we're not even there yet 
you know it doesn't even doesn't even pop up the speaker characterisation yet 
y we have to first define what what happens when you click on a user 
yeah 
yes 
so should we try try to do a right click when you then 
sorry 
yeah 
yes 
wait 
yeah there's a second thing about the topics the topic window 
we wanna somehow click be able to click on a topic and it pops up with all the meetings that contain that 
yeah 
so we could do that in a similar way do it right click as well 
and to have a different menu for our 
yeah 
so yeah 
so we have basically two options of of browsing the meetings is by either um searching and opening individual observations 
and when then we have the interlinking by right click basically 
double click 
oh 
hmm 
yeah 
i don't see there's anything obvious that was that would be able you know that would be 
yeah but then then there's the problem with a lot of windows popping up again 
and they pop up without you even being quite sure what it is you know what i mean 
yeah maybe 
mm 
hmm 
especially if you have a touch pad 
it just goes oh 
well i'll i'll check what it does on on um double click at the moment 
'cause i think it might do something 
but but yeah mm but i don't i don't i d really don't see anything obvious that that would 
i mean if you can think of something that 
sorry 
sorry 
um yeah another thing 
single audio files 
do we wanna use them or not 
yeah single channel that's single channel files 
do we want them 
i mean 
yeah okay yeah yeah 
i mean we might use them while wo to work with them but do we wanna integrate them in so that when you browse you can here's 
do you though 
i mean it's not gonna make much sense if you don't listen to it on its own d do you 
does it 
no hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
yeah wh what do people think in general about the windows cluttering that he's mentioned 
do you think do you think it's really that bad 
that's what i feel as well 
i mean i'm i'm very much i w i wanna have everything customisable 
um 
probably not no 
yeah 
two or three maybe but yeah 
but yeah it depends i mean i i really wanna put the summary in somewhere you know 
and the summary for example is typical 
you open the window you read through it you might click on you know close it again straight away 
but it'd be good to have it there 
i was just thinking of tab 
that true 
yea yeah yeah yeah 
that's right 
i'm not sure yeah 
no 
i don't know 
do you reckon 
i'm sure 
i'm sure you could do anything 
hmm 
i can have a look 
but yeah that that might be an idea yeah 
hmm 
but i mean people get used to it i mean when you use a windows or linux for that matter you have a lot of windows open 
and you manage them 
yeah you can minimise 'em 
yeah yeah 
yeah that's true they're they're definitely 
yeah they're definitely gonna be in the same window yeah 
exclusive 
yeah that that was the plan for the disfluencies anyway 
so d 
yeah do you wanna do that with summaries in 
put the summaries in in the same window 
mutually exclusive with 
summary 
yeah you wanna do that 
yeah 
and finally the prototype he spoke about 
what kind of prototype could we produce 
because i'm i'm just you know i go into the lab and i say right what am i gonna change today 
you know 
and it kind of just it just develops i'm not aiming for anything 
do we wanna aim for something 
i'm i'm pretty much getting there anyway to be honest 
it's not it's not gonna be a lot more work 
oh 
hmm 
mm true 
oh right i see 
hmm 
um probably not 
i don't know can you access other people's 
yeah sure 
i don't know if it's readable at the moment but you can sure have a d have a look 
alright 
'kay 
right well i'll make that readable then 
um so the directory is my number 
well this is not difficult 
it's in all the emails 
not o. four 
o. four five five five 
six o. 
o. four five five five six o. 
and then um there's a folder um n. l. s. s. d. 
and it's called the m. browser 
yes m. for meeting 
really 
no i'm i'm extremely organised you see 
i've got folders for everything 
i love folders 
yep so that's me done 
someone else wanna talk about their stuff 
mm-hmm 
w what where you doing again 
the search okay 
okay 
indexing 
oh 
oh right 
oh that's pretty much there is it 
of making 
oh great 
yeah that's handy 
so you think it shouldn't be too difficult 
oh i see 
yeah 
you have to convert it to some sort of format i suppose 
i mean you should look at look have a look at the the browser code then because um you know they already extract for example transcripts 
put it into a window at least 
what do you mean 
this week's only two days old 
oh 
yeah 
oh that's complete rubbish anyway 
never mind 
just so stupid 
mm-hmm 
well ye the browser as i use it now or as uh you know 
it was there when i took it um uses the um the n. x. t. search to get the data out of the out the files 
which i think is odd but i'm not quite sure how it works yet 
i don't quite understand it 
to get the data i for example to get the summarisation data you have to search for i think the i. d. s or something 
yeah 
yeah 
so they don't you know they don't say look in that and that folder but they say search everything 
oh it does load up quite quickly 
so you know it's not too bad 
but you know you could have a look at them 
no this is not the actual search 
this is just when you open what you know to load the transcript for example to find the transcript for a certain meeting 
it does does an n. x. t. search for the string i don't know transcript or text or whatever 
yeah 
yeah so i don't know if you've looked at the search query s language but it's like a dollar a. text say 
yeah 
and then yeah 
because every every of all of these um 
these files have got um tha an i. d. 
and all the transcript files have got the string i don't know what it is 
words or text or something in it so it just searches for those files 
vaguely 
so 
open 
um um well it's in the code 
just that it you know it yeah you define a search object and then you search on that string 
i had to figure out how to how to do the same thing for the summary 
that's how i 
i had to i had to understand how to do the transcript how they did the transcript to do the summary myself 
yeah just search for a specific string 
so you could just you know you could use that when you if you wanna um take the data out and put it somewhere 
yeah 
if you have a a question about w what the p the code means or where to find the code that you wanna 
you know whatever you wanna do then just send me an email 
i can explain it 
oh yeah 
actually in the moment it's got a load of rubbish because the the um the browser that i used from this from you know 
that they gave us had a lot of extra stuff in 
and i haven't dared throwing out to through out all the functions i haven't you know that i don't need 
yeah just in case 
exactly 
yes 
so they're all in there ye still 
a lot of rubbish but they will be get will be chucked out right at the end i think 
yes 
exactly yes 
yeah 
precisely 
the weekend 
the weekend's still four days off 
oh 
i don't actually have that much to do at the moment 
well oh dear 
well 
i can't remember what i'm supposed to do by the way 
am i supposed to do the summarisation thingibob 
no 
you do 
well i'll do that then 
shall i do that then 
i mean 
or you know 
it shouldn't be to difficult 
i mean 
well i'm doing communications which we had one exercise and i've done that like two weeks ago 
and that's in in two weeks 
yeah it's a nine nine course as well or ten or something 
yeah 
and then then i'm doing parallel programming languages and systems which we had one exercise as well and that's in like friday 
well i'm not doing any background reading so you know 
being lazy 
oh 
yeah if you like 
we can always decide then i mean yeah 
yeah 
um so what what are you planning to do over the weekend then 
you're gonna do the search 
you're gonna implement the search 
everything 
mm-hmm 
it's just that i think we need to set ourselves some milestones because otherwise 
you know 
weeks will go by and 
well you decide i'm not doing much for that prototype 
so 
of 
oh 
well how about we get it done by then 
i mean 
then we can write about it in the in the interim report and s you know and then we've got something to show 
um oh and the the search interface 
maybe you should decide pretty pretty early what kind of things you wanna be able to search for 
and then if you want you can give that to me and i'll i'll build a u nice you know a few tick boxes and drop down menus 
no 
oh that's that's that doesn't exist 
tha that's completely cut and pasted 
that does not exist 
nicely done though isn't it 
it's actually all these all these um things are are nicked from um you know all these drop down menus and tick boxes are nicked from google online 
a screen shot of google 
it's just so much fun 
it's gonna be a little difficult more difficult 
yeah i mean i was going to but you know the whole drop down menus and stuff what we wanna search for is not quite agreed on 
we never agreed on what we wanna be able to search for 
so 
yeah do you wanna you know just get together and think about the different types of search we could possibly do 
and then then we could discuss it next meeting which options we really wanna include 
that would probably involve researching the query language a bit as well to see what that can do 
know 
know already what 
oh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i can do that 
show you what bits the code 
yeah 
ah yeah 
well this time i'm dictating the time 'cause i if i'm not there you can't do anything 
yeah ah it's not gonna take an hour to explain it you know 
i mean 
pick a time 
i i you know let me know whenever 
what monday 
what did you say 
three o'clock 
actually th yeah 
unless you wanna do it after the um after d. 
d. and a. 
that's gonna be tight 
yeah it what front door 
i've not found that yet 
really 
really 
ah 
well i'm just 
i've got it in my computer 
whatever is in my computer 
i just think it's better to do it afterwards 
then we have all the time we need 
rather than have half an hour and then we'll surely run out 
oh 
actually it's not even confirmed yet 
what was she doesn't even know what she's talking about yet i think 
maybe it doesn't happen at all 
is it really 
really 
i don't think we have a reading week though 
the the 
yeah i don't think there is an official i don't think there was an official one last semester 
i think it was just a bank holiday wasn't it 
no 
okay 
let's meet monday 
hmm 
right 
i think we need to tick the okay box right 
ooh 
exciting 
should we turn these off then or what 
funky sh stuff like that 
yeah 
yeah 
look at all this stuff man 
okay 
right 
has anybody 
has anybody done anything 
you better start 
good at this 
right 
d yeah 
the l the left click or the right click 
right 
yeah it might be quite good i suppose 
yeah 
what else could we have in the menu 
okay 
so otherwise you just have a right click or do you have have a 
is a window 
a menu yeah yeah 
yeah it's why 
and so it might be a bit weird the fir to just start bringing up stuff and then it 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
it's more 
it's more idiot proof isn't it 
it's got a button 
add more buttons 
yeah 
well in uh i guess in in in meeting browser one point one 
you can have a menu instead of a button but this why i don't think it yeah 
yep 
i guess so 
so what did you part of the m the menu that comes down it says give me all your meetings or something 
yep 
i guess so 
it's an idea 
get to use my pen 
yeah yeah 
oh yeah 
we have to have a speaker characterisation first before we cross any of the other bridges 
so yeah there you go 
yeah 
alright 
why not 
even if only one thing comes up 
okay 
so and so this lot is for um 
on the t speaker 
and then this lot is on th 
what was that 
i didn't quite understand 
do you mean 
yeah 
oh so and it figures out what's the most common use to double click 
oh 
okay 
yeah 
sometimes you do it by accident though 
you oh go away 
stop coming up 
yeah 
no 
yeah yeah oh yeah 
t throw stuff throwing out the window 
yep 
we don't know yet do we i don't think 
do you mean the single channel 
probably not but we might need them for disfluencies if we try do it in audio 
but at the moment no 
but yeah 
we might want to be able to say oh just give me what that person's saying 
unless um you can't hear it properly or something 
somebody's talking over somebody else or something 
well p 
w we just say no for now and put it in later or something 
yeah yeah 
yeah 'cause otherwise it will the it will increase the amount of data we need by a lot won't it 
therefore print will be bigger 
yeah 
no i think it's i think it's fine 
yeah 
i think what we're doing is fine 
yeah tabs are good 
mozilla style 
yeah 
does anybody know how to do that 
or can you do that in java 
i don't think java knows how to do that really 
maybe yeah you probably can 
but but 
if you really knew what you're doing 
but i don't know 
it's a bit of a cripple with java's windowing tool kit 
the eight is sometimes it's a bit of a cripple 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that will reduce the number of um windows we needed wouldn't it 
which is quite good 
'cause otherwise photoshop has a lot of windows if you ever use photoshop it's got loads 
and you're always g forever going no get out of the way 
there's always stuff in the way isn't there 
so 
yeah 
you do yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
unless can you i don't suppose you can minimise them and stuff like that can you can you do that 
okay well it's alright then 
yeah 
of course you can actually yeah it's got everything 
yeah sounds good 
um 
yeah that's what we need yeah 
something just slightly more than just that on its own 
yep 
yep definitely 
i think that's kinda as well isn't it really 
seeing it seeing it sort of start to do stuff rather than just be 
a prototype with a gui 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
you can make it if you make it world readable then anybody can access it 
yeah 
no uh i i it no they're not world readable 
it not the default they're only default then only you can read them by default 
you can see them but you can't read them 
yeah 
what's your number 
okay your number 
okay 
and then it's 
n. l. s. s. d. 
the m. browser for meeting 
hope you hope you never have to look in my directory 
it's just pure chaos 
s mine is serious chaos 
files everywhere 
don't all jump at once 
yeah 
yeah what was on it 
oh you found some code for it 
for the inde 
alright 
alright 
cool cool 
so even if it doesn't work you can jiggery pokery around and make it work 
y yeah 
yeah yeah 
all sorts of nonsense 
but yeah 
by the basics is uh oh okay that's good 
yeah 
i've been trying to g write something to read the x. m. l. and get rid of it 
and i can get rid of it but i'm having trouble putting it anywhere else 
so it will come up on the screen for the moment i haven't managed to put it into a vector or whatever in java to play with it 
but i guess it's not very difficult 
yeah in java yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah i'm sure they do 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah i will 
i'm sure it's nothing difficult 
i'm sure i'm making a meal of it at the moment actually 
yeah yeah 
absolutely yeah 
should share as much as possible 
yeah 
yep 
next week sometime yeah 
i actually haven't done anything this week 'cause this week's been manic 
but well whatever it was last week then 
the the the week as it as is rather than the proper week do you know what i mean 
do you know that it's been all a bit manic the last m the last yeah 
yeah that's right yeah 
and then we had to do an i. r. p. whatever it was last week as well 
which is only a page long but it's quite difficult to write a page 
more diffi it was it wasn't marked but it was i had to sit there and think about it for a bit which is a bit irritating 
yeah but s. p. n. l. p. 
yeah 
yep 
so when it when it 
that's pretty bizarre isn't it 
well i guess that's how it works 
they've got d 
that is pretty bizarre 
yeah yeah 
that is pretty bizarre 
wh 
four and it w it li it just has an open variable transparent s list whatever find everything that's got that and then load 
yeah 
yeah yeah 'cause that's the uh the declares a variable doesn't it and then they keep okay 
right 
oh see obvious 
so did you have to write it in the way that they wrote it is that what you did 
right 
okeydoke 
fish the data i was just thinking that yeah 
mm 
have you annotated your code nicely 
not yet 
just in case 
mission critical 
yeah 
commen commenting it out one bit at a time and running it does it work yeah 
okay get rid of that next 
good fun aye 
so basically we go and go and do some work really i think that's the um the um the answer to that isn't it 
the long and the short of it 
yeah 
proba i'm still at the bottom of the mountain 
yeah 
well should you find you want to explore any other perhaps you as your um uh quantify raising 
you saw it yeah 
so what courses should i pick to be not doing any work at the moment 
yeah 
oh so it's uh yeah 
yeah me too 
um 
so so what's that two weeks basically 
ish yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah that's it's quite impressive actually 
yeah 
that's quite slow really 
yeah 
no it's not is it 
yeah 
can take us for a tutorial sometime 
next week sometime 
mm monday afternoon 
uh 
three is alright 
it was what time's d. n. l. g. 
four isn't it 
three's good though 
i'll but we have s whatever 
what's you what would you prefer 
we could three thirty in the in the computer room in here and then we can just go stra if you can't can you get in the front door 
oh you haven't got a key do you 
can none of you get in there 
the k the f there's computer rooms in here the m. s. c. computer lab and uh is in here 
well if you find me i'll show you where i'll i'll let us all in there and we can all go in there 
yeah yeah 
you do need to have a key for it 
like that's the thing 
it's got a lock door button 
yeah somebody will answer it 
yeah it's only got it's crap it's only got about four or five computers in but it would do quite good for our job 
'cause it has not very uh p not many people in it very often 
yeah there's fridge there 
and there's a photo copier with the code on it yeah yeah 
it's cool yeah 
oh right 
yeah yeah 
hopefully it's not that man so it won't matter 
some classes did and some classes didn't 
it's all a bit bizarre really 
they didn't really know what was going on 
nah make 'em work 
done 
oh we trust you 
yeah i think the comments are basically the same as what you said 
so it's 
yeah 
oof 
bu buzzes 
yeah 
signing off innit 
log off 
okay 
who wants to take notes today 
okay 
what 
th okay 
i'll make funny drawings 
yep 
thank you 
very interesting start of the meeting 
everyone's looking down reading 
yep 
hmm she never said that 
and i'm being like i don't know not a native speaker of english 
i think is but what whatever 
oh 
we'll see 
yeah 
i'll uh look at it like when my usual working hours are like from twelve o'clock till three o'clock or something 
so if you can work on it that and then like no actually not 
but i'm never online on the morning 
so yeah 
yep 
well 
yeah do what you wanna do with it first and then i'll will look at yeah uh yeah 
and i'll send it out to you again tomorrow or whatever 
yeah 
probably wanna think about if we wanna change our goals and stuff 
i think it um one thing that we could probably skip uh totally is the removing things from the audio files 
that's no i don't th that's that's too big yeah 
no 
yeah 
yeah but that's definitely one thing we could just remove 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean we haven't really yeah 
yeah 
he he d he doesn't have to know exactly what i mean yeah m i mean it's hot finished but it doesn't really say 
yeah 
hmm 
i don't know 
shall we change the deadlines 
yeah 
should we i don't know do you think mike about our things that we had together 
should we i mean now yeah 
i mean we have it now like inverted and you have the other but what about the m 
removing disfluencies 
shall we just 
yeah we just keep it together on the the pap there right now and just see what what 
no not the disfluencies 
no haven't 
yeah 
yeah might be yeah 
yeah 
something 
yeah 
yeah my intent is to work on these things tomorrow a bit more 
so also i don't know if we send it in on the afternoon maybe i can add a few sentences too when i'm done 
then it's done 
and if it's not hopefully it won't be 
oh yep 
yeah 
yeah 
we'll see 
well i was still like struggling with java stuff 
but yeah but i'll work on it 
um i think uh i was wondering about that is uh i haven't looked at it so much 
but if m any of you guys know how we could do the like from the uh extract words that you did 
like also in uh in this extract t time stamps on stuff so we can is it 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay 
yeah 
so now i could just put it in some 
tuple or something yeah 
what on the 
okay 
mm 
yeah 
i'll take a look at that 
pop ups 
all of them no 
what do you say 
okay 
no we haven't 
yeah that's true 
yeah 
yeah like 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that's what and that's what i think we like 
okay 
i mean we're not really uh well i mean 
we're not gonna do much more than just look at the 
the rem like the text problem with disfluencies 'cause we're not gonna search it and we're not gonna like listen to it 
since we're not doing the audio thing 
so i guess just to displaying it is a alright 
but well anyway yeah 
no 
well that is true 
it's probably best and do as you said 
like just like yeah 
no 
no 
yeah 
i have a friend there too 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah maybe asleep 
yeah um 
what 
i don't know 
it doesn't matter for me either 
but 
yeah 
i mean if we both yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and correct back any he like things that i thought was wrong in english or whatever 
it like no 
that's not that or whatever 
yeah 
oh 
it's sad 
i write wrote like four lines of whatever 
um yeah twelve thirty tomorrow with 
steve 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
okay yeah 
basically that's fine yeah 
yeah we could because this could be just some uh a little just just describe some screen shots or something 
yeah you can either have and we can just ignore that bit 
or you can have 
yeah 
yeah you can either have the yeah it says screen shot there and stuff 
but th you can either have screen shots by the thing each one or um have just a bunch of 'em in one session 
it doesn't 
yeah 
i've written the topic segmentation one 
uh it should be alright 
do we d 
i think pernilla should do it yeah 
yeah 
uh yeah exactly 
she's only gonna tell us we got it wrong anyway 
so i'm only joking 
th you can you can perfect it and 
sleep sleep food sleep 
sabotage it 
yeah 
yeah 
nah 
it's a good thing to have to say we cou what we could have done if we had more time 
a good future work thing isn't it 
stick in the conclusion of the final report 
should if we had more time this is what we would have done 
yeah 
yeah if yeah if 
we don't think there's enough time 
or we felt there were more important things to do with our time than 
than worry about 
yeah that's a good idea 
you have should have a section probably 
the best file on target or something 
or t well 
and so i've only got six days to do the topic segmentation as well 
jesus 
yeah 
uh 
speaker characterisation 
jesus 
speaker characterisation's supposed to be done already 
yeah two days ago 
give me a week and i'll tell you the answer to that 
or maybe the speaker characterisation might get slimmer 
probably we won't disappear it yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yep 
yeah we won't make it disappear but we might thin it down a bit 
um but we might not you know but we might have time 
depends how how how how things m 
the topic segmentation with the l. c. seg and text tiles basically done 
it just needs to be done because you know what i mean the co yeah tuned yeah 
a search through the parameters or something 
let's see what happens 
yeah pretty much 
yeah yeah yeah 
certainly 
how about the underlying data for it 
for the d inverted file 
how's that coming along 
yeah 
coming along 
easy yeah 
just yeah well it just um when he pulls up the segments um part of that one of the f one of the attributes you do get attributes 
get attributes it returns a list of attributes 
search through those and and then it just you can that will tell you what attributes it's got 
and then you can either do it automatically or you can just hard code and say look get me the time stamps 
so you just say um get attribute and put i think it's i think the method's called get attribute and just it's called start time and end time 
and that will tell you the start times and end times 
i think it returns it double 
yeah that's on the um the n the the nom right elements 
the the the uh the object is a nom right element i think 
that should uh tell you what it is 
what have th th uh you confuse me 
do you have um three separate windows for the three separate different types of results 
okay not not three different okay okay cool 
yeah 
okay 
right yep 
yeah 
yeah 
or tabs or something 
yeah yeah it's three panes 
it's called a nite text pane or something isn't it 
is it 
text area or something something like that yeah 
nom text yeah 
mostly things are called nom 
yeah 
nite object model i think 
nite object model i think that's what 
with the um 
the removing the disfluencies have you done anything with that yet 
anybody 
'cause um i was wondering how we're gonna write it back to h. t. m. l. i mean x. m. l. if we take if we did the processing 
writing it back to x. m. l. 
seems 
there's a blop of text 
text file 
you will very much limit what you can do with it if it's not in x. m. l. format 
there is some bizarre method that puts things back into x. m. l. format 
but 
what 
oh select what we want just take bits of the x. m. l. and take only it takes certain segments 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
yeah yeah 
certain segments 
okay yeah yeah 
alright 
okay 
that 
it says something different there 
that's what 
then written to a written to a file 
i kinda doubt just that it would ever be done 
but that will mean that you can only do things on actually no uh 'cause you need to do things on word level 
so yeah that's fine 
yeah 
yeah 
it's fine 
yeah 
yeah but it would 
it would just be blurb like a summary 
it won't look like it won't say speaker x. says this speaker y. says that speaker z. says this 
and 
yeah 
then it will look ugly probably 'cause it will look just black and white 
unless you want as dark colouring 
no no i don't think that's i think it's true 
it does it on the fly anyway didn't it 
so 
so then just goes through it and says if this word equals that then print 
just a bunch of if statements is 
yeah you probably could actually 
this is probably and that's probably not that much more difficult 
you just fatten the code out a bit 
i it would be the same thing 
and they can't yeah exactly 
shouldn't no 
it's just uh they'd just be if statements when they fast if statements aren't they 
this is loads of if statements 
well is that 
i wouldn't wanna have to put it take to put it back into x. m. l. with java 
even trying to read it in x. m. l. with java was complicated enough 
i gave up doing that completely and just defaulted back to n uh nite stuff 'cause it was much much much easier 
so if we can do it with nite stuff do it with nite stuff i think 
otherwise you're gonna be s java trying to do s it was just so complicated it was ridiculous 
don't believe it 
you have to d start defining object models like the nite thing and getting all bizarre w weird things 
it was mad 
yeah 
i spoke to 
yeah it's always it's is it 
it's just a it's just a for loop really 
should be fine yeah 
yeah 
yeah i included a future work in my own section 
but 
i just said i said what i've done so far and what i'm gonna do and some pro some issues 
i think you lose the 
you might lose a bit of continuity if you do that though 
that's what i was thinking 
but sometimes it's easier to have the top it in its own its sections if you see what i mean 
so you talk about speaker characterisation you say what you've done and 
goals or something 
something bullet pr bullet bullet points 
yeah 
because if you have a discursive thing here and then another discursive thing there 
if they're not together you lose a lot of the um the continuity i think 
but um 
so apart from that yeah 
yeah 
you stick it together 
she'll shine it 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
s steve o. 
twelve days and write yeah 
not much without any of us 
no 
yeah 
okay 
i like the timeline 
uh b let me see it 
oh that's the same 
oh 
very good 
um i'm not sure uh if we need the outline of the prototype 
i mean what what are we gonna put into that 
yeah because i mean that's basically what we're doing here isn't it 
the whole 
yeah 
yeah 
yes 
yeah 
um 
yeah well i mean it's up to you if you wanna keep going with that 
i'm happy to do some as well 
i have lots of time tonight 
um and then uh we'll send it to you and you can do the final revisions 
i'm sure 
i know you're always online 
you always make me feel bad because uh when i go to bed at like one you're still online 
you never go to bed 
yeah you pretend 
always busy 
yeah right 
yeah so maybe 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
oh there's more 
oh i see 
oh this is the one that okay 
that's what i thought as well i mean do we are we are we actually gonna attempt that 
i don't think so either yeah 
i think that's gonna be a b we don't even know how to approach that at the moment i think 
yeah yeah 
yeah yeah that's right 
um um so maybe i mean we we should we should definitely well we could probably not put it under this heading 
but put it under changes since the initial specification 
and say you know we didn't we decided the the r time is too short whatever 
yes 
yeah 
we would prefer to concentrate on the main 
and i think we should probably uh comment explicitly on the milestones here as well and say we managed to do 
m m meet these milestones at yeah 
like you know develop prototype gui 
we t you know ah yeah we managed that nicely 
uh 
yeah yeah 
yeah put it put it good 
conceptually 
and you can say yeah 
we uh say we are still aiming for the development to be complete on the or something 
m 
whoa 
i yeah i 
yeah that's right 
i i really wanna do it 
i mean it's not it's not gonna be difficult 
if at least have all the information pop up that is already in the meta data file 
that's gonna be no work at all 
so it's definitely gonna be something there 
yeah it might turn out easier than thought 
um 
yeah sounds good 
what else 
we should probably d sorry we should probably do another responsibility of packages as well 
that's what he hinted that we should also um indicate who who is responsible for what from now on 
well you could put you know yeah i don't know 
so um 
have you managed any further on the search thing 
alright 
that's nice 
yeah yeah yeah 
so w is there um did you have you made uh another m. browser 
is there something that i should 
not since you looked at it last no 
but i will tonight that's the point 
no 
after the weekend 
weekend was out 
mm-hmm yeah yeah 
well at the moment is there at the moment is there a window that comes up 
or is that a r a second results pane 
or is there you know does the window get larger 
what's there kind of what are you thinking 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
yeah 
yeah i quite like the idea of a tab in that case 
but you wouldn't want to compare the result the topic one topic result with one summary result would you 
actually mm yeah 
especially if you get if you get results for the same meeting 
maybe yeah yeah 
yeah yeah it's true 
yeah 
i mean we could we could order them by meeting for example 
how to order it 
yeah well i mean uh if you know that's uh you even a second step the first question is do we want to order them 
how do we wanna order them in the first place 
yeah 
yeah maybe we should do that 
yeah m why don't you just um 
colour code those 
the results to three different colours 
no but if you 
if you if you do it straight from you know you get th you get the result 
and then there's some if statement saying s straight on the you know 
rock bottom lev level saying if th if you found a segment then colour it print it in red or whatever and 
as opposed to 
oh right 
ah 
well have a look 
oh mm-hmm 
yeah yeah i can imagine 
oh oh i see yeah 
you you have to use actions 
um yeah i mean um at the moment it works it works with highlighting in in the transcript window doesn't it 
so 
what do you mean it should work with anything 
mm-hmm 
yeah i mean the whole um the m what fills the transcription box and all of these boxes is a special sort of pane made by nite 
so i am not sure what it's called now 
um 
um some 
um no but i know what it's called 
and that comes with a whole load of highlighting extras as well 
as i said you know if you if you left click on something for example it highlights automatically 
so maybe it comes with something clever as well 
yeah 
no i'm sure it hasn't got pane in it 
nite 
i don't know text text yeah something like that 
might yep 
nom text there is alright 
yeah why what's nom anyway 
nite oh 
why do you why do we want it in x. m. l. there 
i mean i thought we'd we'd just selectively selectively write the x. m. l. that we've got 
so as as opposed to 
yeah t 
yeah only only print out certain um certain segments the segments that we want just selectively 
at the moment it prints out all of them 
we'll just put an if loop in it that leaves out some of the print statements 
not not store it at all whatsoever 
because 
oh right 
yeah 
so what 
yeah yeah you don't really need to do much more with it 
yeah that's right 
i don't think it's gonna take long to to produce anyway 
it's just another um i mean these meetings are not endlessly long it's just words and to print all of them out selectively 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
you could nearly do it together with with uh the transcription with the original transcription have them run parallel 
so if certain you know if it's a proper word 
print it on both both panes and if it's not a proper word then print it only on one 
but i mean that's that's you know fancy but 
but um 
yeah 
yeah 
but then 
you know the the b the good way of doing it um not together is that you if someone doesn't wanna look at the the 
you know the chop file then you don't ever have to produce it 
so but i mean you can you know 
you can write we can write something like um we'll try and do it on the fly and and observe if if that gonna is gonna take too long 
if it's gonna take too long we'll think about writing it to a file and doing it off line 
yeah i um 
oh right 
yeah 
hmm 
mm 
that's what programming is all about i'm afraid 
yeah 
maybe 
that's the higher people 
well i mean 
yeah why don't you put both of both of those ideas in into that that paragraph and say you'll have a look at both or something 
if you wanna do it 
i i personally don't wanna mess with uh writing files or anything the moment 
i wanna do it superficially 
yeah 
yeah 
well it has already learned it anyway 
yep 
yep 
so should we all write um a letter or two about future work as well 
a word or two 
oh right 
yeah well maybe you could 
maybe you could split that up and 
yeah like here is what we've done already and then you know down here 
mm 
maybe 
yeah that's right 
yeah 
yeah maybe 
maybe 
mm yeah maybe you're right 
no 
sounds good 
anything else anyone wants to talk about 
we're all half asleep aren't we 
burnt out 
what 
huh 
maybe asleep 
but uh so we're all still writing our um summaries sending them to you you send it on to pernilla 
how kind 
yeah 
yeah 
and then send it on to us so we can nod 
okay 
sounds good 
i haven't used my pen 
oh god 
no 
oh 
channel 
mm 'kay 
l i could take notes this time i guess 
i'll takes notes this time i guess 
actually i suppose i'll use this 
um actually first thing i just sorta did a really sorta brief um yeah version of what we have to do 
um actually i can just take that if you want 
actually for that i was just copying the one straight out of the other documents 
so it's all whatever inaccurate and well 
but yeah 
okay 
um 
oh she has 
she has her own 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
well just sorta well the thing is yeah 
we're gonna be touching on all that during the other part for the progress and putting screen shots and all the rest yeah 
exact yeah 
well it's something that he had mentioned in the um in the previous like just to sort of have a prototype together 
and so i was just saying that you know we could potentially do that 
i don't know 
it's not something we have to 
alter 
yeah 
yeah sure 
like the thing is i was thinking even in the stuff that i was doing i mean 
just throw the screen shots in there when you talk about what you're doing right 
it kinda makes sense 
so yeah 
oh yes oh actually i have a i have that at the very end screen shots 
but that didn't show up on this page 
so it's not even relevant 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
anyways so um so yeah this just very general structure um i guess from this we can just pop in our little blurbs and and uh 
oh yeah 
cool 
i guess 
um so i don't know if there's other stuff that you think should be done to this i could do that before i mail it to you guys 
um otherwise yeah 
um did someone else wanna throw it togeth actually i can probably still throw it together if you want um put your parts into into this one 
i'm the perfectionist right 
yeah 
yeah 
that's a good idea 
let's just cut out the middle man you know 
just yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
or you just leave your computer on maybe 
logged in 
yeah 
yeah 
actually i noticed that no one is 
anyways alright 
okay 
so i'll send it off to you 
then um 
yep 
okay 
right 
actually d um 
yeah 
was there anything else we wanted to add to the time line 
i mean essentially it was what like f um you can't see it right there 
here i'll s here's the old one 
well that's that's the orig this the original one 
yeah yeah which just copied straight out 
um 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
unless we d unless we discover some sorta time warp thing it's not gonna happen 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah sure 
yep 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
this this and this 
or some of them were later some were yeah 
we could even 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
yeah 
yeah 
more or less 
yeah 
search yeah 
p plus plus or minus three days to yeah 
yeah that's that that's true too 
that's true yeah 
ah that's plenty 
you don't have any uh s. p. n. l. p. assignments do you 
yeah 
oh really 
oh jeez 
h um is are one of those something that you wanna change and delete from our list of expectations 
yeah 
okay 
alright 
like should we put i a hint that something like that might happen into the document 
okay 
alright 
okay 
yeah i know 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah okay 
yeah true 
yeah 
okay sounds good 
yeah 
okay 
tuned i guess or yeah 
yeah 
cool 
mm 
okay 
right 
yeah 
well i could probably just copy that straight out of the other one as well 
that's essentially the same as it was 
maybe more detailed specifically 
mm 
split those apart 
yeah 
i think so yeah like yeah inverted file 
yeah exactly 
oh 
well if we're skipping the audio one and then things got easier 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
have you taken any more of a look at it 
have you taken any more of a look at it 
at the disfluenc okay 
yeah 
okay 
we could probably 
i know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow 
we could just make it up 
like i'll claim one you'll claim the other for the search things and then we could leave that one as a a joint one 
and that'd be good 
um i found finally today something that i can build it in and it uh i should have something for tomorrow 
i should uh you know at least very least have uh um a gui and uh wire i'll be wiring that in hopefully tomorrow morning 
so i wanna get something i wanna see this i wanna get it together 
have an image in my mind and i just wanna see it on the thing and then get a nice screen shot 
so 
um 
mm-hmm 
well 
w well well it doesn't really matter i mean you could write the sentences first as well 
i mean with the intention that this is done 
i mean and also some sometimes it's a bit of a motivating factor too 
i mean you write down the words and the ideas as oh okay 
well i'll do this i'll do that you know it just all falls together 
hmm 
oh 
oh yeah 
um there is but i w i haven't made a lot of changes to it 
so i might just um delete what i've done and copy again from yours 
'cause i'm sure you've probably made some changes already 
oh really 
since friday 
okay 
i thought you said okay 
oh right i see 
okay 
i thought you said that you had written some things that maybe have caused some bugs and that you were gonna fix those on the weekend or something 
no okay 
alright 
alright yeah okay 
right 
okay cool 
um yeah so if you although there's stuff out there that actually i'm gonna try and minimise the amount of changes i make to m. browser anyways 
shouldn't um 
shouldn't be an issue 
actually just to clarify last week when we were talking about our search results 
um like if we have topics as well as transcripts as well as what was the other 
summaries 
um do we want separate result panes uh for each of those 
or do we want them all in one pane with like an icon or a different colour or something to indicate what type of result they are 
so that when they you know click on that it's gonna go to the relevant thing 
like just if they check all three say topics summaries blah blah blah have three different windows come up 
or three like sub sub panes sort of 
um 
what um i thought what we sorta discussed last week was to have it sort um the same window 
um so it'll be on the search window bottom half of the search window 
um i don't know if we still wanna keep it that way but that's uh that's what i was gonna be working 
so so it's just like you click those and it's just loads up 
you know splits that thing into like two or three or whatever that is 
one two or three depending on which ones you check 
and then um so if we wanna do it that way you know like it probably doesn't matter too much 
just trying to think if there's gonna be any other issues down the road um depending on 
no just just panes just result panes for each of the three no no no no no 
no no 
so so it's just when we click you know topics and summaries for what we wanna search 
then it'll uh you know there'll be two result panes 
so for one for topics one for i don't not really tabs 
um but then you can't see all of them at the same time and it's just like 
well it's no but the thing is if you're looking if you could check them both um you wanna see all the results 
yeah exactly 
yeah 
so the summary and the topic and the transcript are um so um or we could just put them all into one result pane on that same window and just indicate 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah i guess that was the other thing whether we wanna have this reorder by columns and all that 
but that's a hassle too 
it's a lot of work 
yeah 
i think yeah probably by meeting makes most sense 
i mean essentially they're tem you know in time order 
so yeah that kinda makes most sense 
least uh 
yeah 
yeah 
should be an easy no i don't know actually 
should be fairly easy i guess 
yeah 
thinking sometimes in a case like that like a run across um in other languages 
just that it's hard to tell what kind of object it was originally once it's put into like a list box or something 
it's hard to tell whether it was a a transcript or whatever 
and then if we're highlighting something in a transcript window 
it may be difficult to get that information back once it's just in a list box an item in a list box 
so let's there's yeah 
whereas if it's coming from 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
it's just silly 
yeah 
um yeah it's just like from past experience i've there's goofy little things that happen 
and it just doesn't let you save certain things and it's just kinda um trying to to do a different kind of to go to a different window 
so if you wanna go to the actual highlight the transcript or highlight the topic or highlight the summary 
at that point that's sorta where it starts getting a little bit tricky 
'cause you're working with an event handler within the one panel or list box or whatever it is 
and uh 
so um there are ways around it but you know whether i'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow yeah i know 
or delegates or whatever the all that stuff 
so anyways 
right 
i think so 
i think he was saying that as long as we implement that um interface um it should work with anything that we do 
like highlighting the yeah 
i think that was um who is saying that 
um wasn't jonathan saying something about that 
i think it was just like as long as we implement one of these interfaces for this particular type of window 
we should be able to have that highlighting happen 
i don't know 
i don't 
anyways 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay 
alright 
okay 
okay maybe i should maybe i should use that as well in my yeah okay 
hmm 
yeah why 
yeah 
okay that makes sense 
mm 
no 
um 
it's i thought we were just going to have that as words 
like not ev not as x. m. l. just sort of as a was that what was that um what transcripts recent oh no 
transcript no 'cause then we need all the other data if we wanna keep it a transcript right 
yeah 
yeah that's true yeah 
good point 
hmm 
oh yeah 
okay then that's then that's not yeah 
yeah i know 
that's sorta what we were thinking before 
actually but this makes more sense 
yeah 
yeah if we're gonna do the x. m. l. then fine that's that probably makes it easier 
mm-hmm 
as text you mean 
the thing is like well how would we display the like if we do take disfluencies out and just c you know 
create a text file take the disfluencies out of the text file and then yeah 
unless we extract that out of the file when we create the text file 
yeah 
that's true too 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
or i don't know 
i was just thinking as well i mean we could probably even use like x. s. l. t. to kinda just transform it and you know 
flip it into uh yeah just uh transforms um like um style sheet the um x. m. l. style sheet 
and then it's kinda like there's usually things built in to well should be built into java 
i mean to process x. m. l. into like in just creates whatever file it's gonna be in 
uh it's been a f couple of years since i've looked into anything like this 
but uh that might even be an easier way 
and then that way we could even pre process that before hand 
i don't know do well we don't wanna have to do that right 
although on the fly it's typic it's it's typically pretty fun 
oh right 
oh really 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah okay 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
yeah okay 
are you serious 
it's insane 
actually i was thinking i might try and talk to who is it jonathan and jean 
like just to see h what they what system they used to develop this stuff 
'cause it would be nice to have all the tools there and just like have the object model and just kind of like plug and play with everything and just to actually use the system 
you know at a higher level rather than kinda you know 
playing around with a little bit of code and modifying their code and doing this and that 
it'd be nice to just sorta see what they're doing 
so i might uh try and contact them see if there's i don't know 
any other hints they could give us 
just to get things i don't know moving at a higher level i guess 
it seems it'd be more interesting to use it as a a real developer would 
'cause just seems like a little tinkering here and there and just adding couple things and i don't know 
so 
a channel 
n no no it shouldn't be no 
it should be higher level 
it should be conceptual and you know coming up with the the brilliant ideas and then just yeah bringing those to reality 
yeah 
i don't know 
hmm 
hmm 
yeah 
like the thing that i was thinking there is well is that once it's done for a f you know one meeting it's done and it's there 
it's file 
text file or x. m. l. or whatever it is 
but yeah just i don't know just it doesn't make any difference really either way to me 
it's like hmm if it's fast enough on the fly then sure 
um that's about the only issue i have with on the fly whether it's fast enough 
hmm 
especially with java and all this other crap 
it's just if it's loading the file and doing all the rest and processing the p 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
whether it runs out of memory 
hmm 
um 
yeah yeah 
right 
actually yeah that makes sense 
um oh like into each separate i know yeah 
yeah act 
okay 
i think that does make sense 
but maybe at the end maybe just uh a point form of you know things that we're still working on things that we'll do 
yeah yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i know what you mean 
yep 
yeah 
actually i'll just 
oh that's true 
hmm 'kay 
yeah 
snore 
okay 
or or she'll just take she can take it from now 
doesn't matter 
or do you want to or no 
uh okay i c i can yeah sure if you wanna send them to me that's fine 
yeah okay actually no no n actually that's a good idea i'll take one quick look over 
try and get it as good as i think that we yeah 
okay 
purely a formality 
right 
okay we're changing dialogue back to hello jean 
no 
okay 
oh 
i have 
okay 
oh oh right okay 
well i thought you had tomorrow off 
did we get seven out of ten for the other one 
okay 
yep 
not bad 
um i think there is 
just because um the the topic box and all this is um is based on um oh what's it called nom no nite text area or something 
in text area is that what it is 
um it has some sort of highlighting stuff there 
so you should probably look at the 
um 
i'm not sure if it's in built though to be honest 
what what what wh wh 
you don't 
okay i'll do it 
yeah i w i was thinking about uh i was going that direction anyway 
yeah that 
okay yeah 
so 
okay yeah i see what you mean 
i think 
i think 
so um i uh have you already calculated all this data or are you supposed to do that 
oh right 
alright 
uh what should it come back as 
numbers 
oh yeah 
um whatever you give me i can do it i think 
i mean um 
um 
um so what will whenever we open a window for one speaker um 
yeah yeah 
sh pretty much i would have thought 
yep 
yep 
definitely 
oh is it 
um the one present 
although we could do th mm we could do the one highlighted i suppose 
mm 
mm-hmm 
i mean that would um that would be um implementing what you said 
that you wanna see per topic you wanna see which one spoken most something like that 
so you could you could zap through these topics uh meetings sorry 
and um and it would come up with how much they spoke and you can pick the one that s looks the most interesting 
so do you wanna do that then 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah definitely 
so yeah random things like just like return talking time 
or 
yeah 
good 
yeah i mean 
can you put in there what topic was spoken about as well 
then i could use that for the for the topic pop up window 
that'd be r 
that wasn't what 
yeah 
yeah 
because at the moment if you right click on a topic window on one of the topics 
you have the option of pop popping open a window which gives you a list of all the meetings containing that topic 
so 
yeah 
yep 
so how how would you d how would you calculate that 
would you do the summarisation as you populate it 
you know just yeah for the global 
oh right so oh so that that is all sta stored together 
oh right okay 
okay 
sounds good 
so have you done these yet the no 
mm just gotta decide on what we wanna 
um yeah definitely 
yeah 
so it's all all usable now can i do it tonight 
hmm 
oh i see 
yeah 
well let me know when when it's sort of usable 
or at least 
what do you mean a picture 
do you mean just the yeah but it's not gonna take very long 
i mean it's m yeah 
mm 
hmm 
sounds good 
so where is that 
is that stored in the uh 
on your home directory not in the okay 
yeah 
sounds good 
alright 
yeah 
well are you wanting to write that in directly or what what do you wanna do with that 
if you wanna change my code 
you're yeah but are you do you wanna change that m the original m. browser file then 
or yeah 
have you done that now 
or 
oh okay so not the actual one but a copy of it 
okay yeah 
no i just 
well just just tell me when 
because i usually i usually work on my own copy for for the day and then update it without checking if th if the one in the one in the shared one has changed 
so okay 
yeah let me know 
yeah 
cool 
so is that what you're working on now then to in to rip to present the results nice overall 
you mean the hi highlighting stuff 
or 
yeah 
actually for um um for an n. text area whatever it is um they they defined some ha handy highlights on that 
so you've got different different highlights 
you've got just look at the the what they wrote about it 
they've got like user highlights um selection highlights time highlights and 
something else 
so you can quite easily if your text area is called area you just do area dot set highlights or something you know 
something like that 
that's the way i did it to to highlight to cross highlight between topic and then transcripts 
sorta thing 
really 
really 
oh yeah allocates more dat more room or whatever 
more memory 
does it talk to you now does it 
yeah 
spent too much time in front of it i think 
mm 
right well i've been uh i've been doing some random pop up windows for the speaker characterisation which is good 
so i can feel that in now 
the windows are all there now after lots of fiddling 
well you know just the pop uh pop up window was difficult enough 
because um it it m basically has to set up um like whatever ten pop up windows in memory as in already initialize them 
because there's there might be ten speakers that all have to have different mee windows and um and i'm working on when you click on a topic to see a list of the of the topics of of of the meetings that that topic was mentioned in 
and i have uh a question about the we said we wanted a start screen 
what kind of start screen do we want 
i mean do we want some general blurb about welcome to the browser or something 
some animation dancing on 
yeah 
so do we want yeah maybe we could write an on like the whatever it's called the the top of the window saying welcome to the meeting browser 
yeah but how 
m i mean at the moment the way it is it's uh it's a drop down menu as you've seen 
um with all the and that because it's it's the dialogue class that you use there 
yeah 
i mean i think they should have two options either load up a meeting that they choose or do a search 
and through that once you've got the results you click on something and that loads up the first 
oh 
does it 
oh 
oh ju just bec mm 
oh 
can you not get this nom object um 
i suppose we wouldn't wanna use yeah we yeah we wouldn't wanna use n. x. t. at the beginning anyway 
because we don't wanna search um locally we wanna search globally 
so d so let's say 
well no then they would open the meeting first right 
so let's say they have two options either pick one meeting or search globally to find a meeting that they like 
yeah 
no but why do we want default 
i mean just you know 
yeah but local search 
we can't do global search without anything 
pretty much 
yeah i mean the local 
yeah 
but yeah the the global um inverted file search gives the nom objects basically to the local search right 
well yeah th that's always gonna be the case with search 
mm 
i mean you can uh you know the option is to do a search in the way that you d if you do a global search 
first as a first step and you return the meetings 
as in they're not even the meetings but the name of the meetings so you know say you wanna search for the word language 
then it gives you as a result all the meetings that contain the word language 
and then you can decide well i wanna search on this and this and this meeting or only on this meeting or 
yeah 
definitely yeah 
there is um yeah in the in in one of the papers they have m um names such as um better understanding or whatever 
even w one of them is yeah one of them is even even better understanding or something 
i i love that 
yeah 
i love that 
yeah 
yep 
so i've yeah i've put that in already to 
sort of 
so yeah again concretely to the start up start up um libraries window 
um 
well can i 
yeah how is that 
i mean do you think you would have have time for that as well 
wha what does t. f. i. d. f. stand for 
oh 
okay 
yeah 
ah 
so the general score would that be a um for the whole of the language or the for all the whole of the corpus 
okay 
okay 
well you know you can you might have some general frequencies 
oh i see 
so what would the if we had the these fake topics what what would the what would they look like 
a bunch 
just a list of like three words or something 
alright 
because that would be really handy then we can actually test it on the user as opposed to just doing it and not using it 
'cause if you just have the segmentation that's great 
but we can't we can't compare it to the to the uh hand annotated you know the hand segmented tool 
hmm 
mm 
hmm 
yeah that would work 
that'd be really nice 
mm yeah yeah definitely 
yeah that's what i'm thinking too yeah 
well do we want to 
do we want to 
sort of but then the main idea was more like to to speed it up speed the search up 
because n. x. t. over the over the whole of the corpus was just not feasible 
but it would be 
no but the general inverted file 
oh yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
that would just be a nice extra 
yeah i i wasn't sure if it was or not 
true 
it's true 
so what it's only interim 
yeah i mean if you have time 
do that as well that'd be really nice yeah 
'cause i mean then then it would give you like if you searched for a word 
it would give you the the meetings but also how often the w that word occurred in that meeting 
that would be so useful 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
yeah yeah 
yeah but it would be useful if you yeah 
you know you c if you have a if if you search for language and you return like you know 
basically all of the meetings you wanna see where they actually spoke about it and where they just mentioned it once 
ah 
language and 
no just like edinburgh and language 
alright 
and then and then ad add those up or something 
or what 
how would you combine them that's the question 
so to come back to the start up screen i'm i'm i'm i'm very unsure about what that should look like 
i mean we wanna for the part where you can choose choose the the meeting what kind of information do you wanna have about the meeting 
i mean the u the the longer name obviously if there is one 'cause they don't all have a longer name 
what the users that spoke 
the users that took part 
but then that's probably pretty much the same for the same group 
yeah i'm not sure 
yeah just to give them an idea general idea what there is and so they can pick a a to um a meeting 
yeah 
yeah or w you kn yeah 
i wanna look at the meeting where so and so spoke um of that you know sort of some sort of research group 
i want that first meeting 
look at that 
oh 
oh 
mm i don't think we need that yeah 
because we we just wanna have a way of of yeah 
because as soon as they've got loaded their first meeting y they can they can browse through that quite nicely 
yeah 
what do you mean 
w how how are we gonna know that 
have a user model 
but that would defy the whole point of browsing right 
if you only wanted to look at like five meetings 
well you just you just uh you just scroll down the list and find your favourite one 
i mean it's not like they come back every day and do the same browsing 
let's see what's changed today 
mm 
yeah yep 
oh right oh okay 
well 
yeah 
no that's um 
i w i wasn't gonna put any you know any any help in there any sort of a explanation of how the browser works to be honest 
i wasn't oh right 
mm-hmm 
i see 
but i mean the main thing what you wanna do is to view a meeting right 
yeah or search yeah 
s and both of those we have and 
yeah that uh all happens for the search basically 
basically either the user wa knows which meeting he wants to look at and he just clicks on it 
or he doesn't and then he searches for one that sort of looks like 
yeah 
oh i see what you mean 
inside the search menu yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah that's that's what yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah that looks about right 
um but i'm i'm unsure about how to how to put all the information in there 
because we need drop down menu but we want all the information about the name the longer name and the sp and the users 
so how d how d 
no but the codes i mean at least maybe if they know the codes and in or the to in or the corpus corpi 
yeah 
drop down is definitely not 
yep yep 
yeah 
but then yeah as i said how do you do it 
um 
no no no i'm not i'm not saying you can you can pick a user but you should come up with some list 
but an extended list of the of the meetings so you know you have b. d. r. whatever it was called o. one 
and then it gives you the longer name blah and then it gives you the you know the participants 
i was thinking that 
yeah 
tool tip 
but then yeah 
uh no it's not at all i think 
a tool tip yeah 
i've not tried that yet but i was i was gonna do that 
i'm very yeah very keen on that yeah 
yeah i'm not sure what th it is that very is that not annoying if you have to hold your m you know 
you ha you have t yeah y yes 
they do that a lot don't they 
no but you know to to search for a u pecif pec specific user you have to hold your mouse over that one 
wait for it to pop up hold your mouse on that one wait for the pop um 
hmm 
mm 
yeah 
it'd just be nice to have some basic information on on each of the meetings 
yeah i'm thinking that that updates depending on what you've got highlighted 
yeah maybe that's the best idea then 
so you've got a drop down menu a search a search button not search go button 
and then 
some sort of field which updates dynamically depending on what you've got highlighted 
yeah 
yeah that sounds good 
i think 
nom 
yeah 
what does nom actually stand for 
nite oh yes 
oh 
oh yeah 
you've got lots of nom something and then nite something and then n. something 
oh really 
oh 
oh 
no 
in most of the descriptions are hints to each other saying you've gotta update this jonathan 
this is this is uni unintelligible 
great 
i know it is 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yep definitely 
not very fun 
right so anyone else got anything to say 
do we yeah do we want another meeting at the end of the week um with pernilla 
yeah 
yeah something like that 
i mean uh i think i'm gonna do quite a bit of work this week so i'll have probably more to talk about 
i think yeah 
well 
if you like 
well we can disc uh discuss that on friday if we have one 
friday 
what what time 
um 
i've got a doctor's appointment at ten to two 
what 
li 
w how about qui 
i can't 
um what i oh no no that that would only give us like thirty five minutes or something 
well what how about quite late 
like you know five or six 
well three o'clock let's say three o'clock for now 
okay 
right 
i'll write um i'll write this meeting up and i'll send it to pernilla as well 
no 
because she's not here 
i collect meeting summaries 
yeah no we should probably do that at end depending on 
so can we just can we just r repeat briefly what we've spoken about 
so we've din done uh progress on the speaker characterisation who does the speaker characterisation 
we've mentioned topic labelling with uh key words 
um we discussed if the search should be ranked 
and michael did you have anything else 
and a start up window 
oh well basically not not unless you've got time for at the end 
it would be nice at the end 
i think it would 
yeah 
i think i think it w it would it would give you the most relevant result 
no but for things like if you search for language then you might have you have some topics which have as a 
you know n some some meetings which have as a topic language they specifically speak about language and they use that word like in every sentence 
and then you've got those that just mention you know mention it briefly like once or twice saying 
you know my language is german or something stupid that you don't really want 
so you wanna distinguish those somehow 
or would be nice anyway 
yeah yeah 
uh for multiple terms we can just do something really simple 
i mean 
yeah 
yeah just just just disregard it yeah 
yeah i mean you'd you'd just do it really simply you know 
you'll have the results as before but yeah yeah 
can discuss it on friday 
it doesn't have to be all intelligent 
yeah exactly 
mm 
well it's not that many meetings 
so that sh that shouldn't is there really 
wow 
ooh 
hmm yeah that's true 
it would be useful as well for a word like language that might occur in all of them 
but you wanna find the one that actually contains it usefully somehow 
you know you still wanna be able to search for for the word language 
in a sensible way 
well we'll discuss it again on friday 
yep 
yep 
tick 
oops 
does it squeeze in aye like that 
yeah 
okay 
right 
yep 
it's going uh 
okay 
sure 
just said the same things you just said 
so how we're getting along 
t uh i wanted to talk about that actually 
um this speaker um the data processing is fine but uh we don't particularly want to do the b the the b the gui for it 
no not really 
if someo if you wanna do that then then tell me how you want the data presented how the 'cause do you want me to tell you 
okay like 'cause at the moment the the the there is i've created two classes one that represents speakers 
one that represents the meetings and the meet and the information about both is contained within each object 
so and then they wr it writes objects and the objects contain all the information about the meetings and the speakers 
so that the who the speakers that are at the meetings and the amount they speak and then the averages are contained with the speakers 
so there's two separate class aren't there 
and they all they're two different objects 
and you can recall they can write the it writes the objects and then you call the objects back and they ha those returned objects have all the information that they need 
and then you can call methods to return whatever you want 
or everything but that's why i wanted to know how ho what's the easiest way to have the data 
yeah supposedly all calculated yeah 
um and all stored as objects so dot object files 
um which means that you just ret call constructor and call the load thing and call it there and you can create a list of them or a vector of them or whatever you wanna do 
yeah 
and then or just call them one at a time to populate window 
but that's what i wanted to how y how what format do you want the data to come back in 
'cause it can come back as a almost anything 
what's easiest to display on the screen 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah ca you could 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so um so i can have it so that it returns you a 'cause at the moment the main data structures are hash tables for the meetings that say it's got one that says percent it's called percent talk 
one's percent noise and one is percent participation 
do you see what i mean 
so and then it's got inside it's got a link for it's got a it's got the n speaker's name and then it's got their percentage for that thing 
so it can either come back as a you can have the hash table or you can have it returned as a vector and it will say noise 
uh just a string is noise w x. percent 
it will say vector this cou i don't know whatever 
w you can either have it th you could either have it you could i have it like an embedded in vector or array of strings and each one represents one person or whatever 
what the what the easiest thing dec how how you wanna display it 
okay 
yeah exactly 
exactly 
yeah 
see that's the ca how did we can i have a look at that again 
okay 
s if it's in that format it's speaker 
it's speaker speaker is the uh controlling thing not yeah yeah okay yeah yeah 
yeah 
so all of this uh all that's calculated as well stored as speaker objects 
yeah that's that's easy 
some are quite amusing actually 
the uh the influences of i lived in germany for six months don't know if that had any effect 
just spend too much time talking to brits 
that was bizarre thing 
where did these people come from 
so then the all that's calculated as well 
all i have to do is get the dialogue acts 
i don't think that'll be difficult 
um 
so then does this how does is how is this box populated 
is it populated by the one present or the one highlighted 
the one present okay 
'cause at the moment i'm using there is there are methods that say um for the using for other talks 
so that's and it says like get get talk time and you and y it takes a name 
so that w could call that would call that and call the meetings method that said return that 
and that would populate that which should be an easy thing to do 
um and the same for that comes out there 
meetings 
yeah yeah 
yep 
yeah yeah that would be easy as well yeah 
yeah okay 
so i'll w i'll just leave in lots of methods that st that'll just return one number at a time 
that'll be the easiest way to do yeah 
okay yeah that's fine 
yeah 
get talk time i think it's called at the moment something like that yeah 
no it's stored as an object file 
it processes a whole lot off line and stores it as an object and then they're much much smaller 
they're only like a one um one thou one k. 
yeah it's all pre processed 
and then it's just each method object's got a return bunch of return methods 
you have to g re create the object 
it's got a load method 
so what you do is you call a null constructor 'cause if you call the th proper constructor for each meeting 
it goes off and does all the processing and stores own object 
and then um if you call a null constructor 
then you pr call load and you can call load and whatever one or all of them or anything like that 
go through a list 
yeah 
one object for each meeting 
yeah 
although yeah yeah 
although you c 
yeah 
it's just tell it tells you who participated 
at the moment it tells you who participated and the amount they participated in percentages and in time as well 
yeah yeah that'll be pro that'd be easy yeah 
yeah if that won't be too difficult 
but that would be that would cause a problem with anything that wasn't annotated for topics 
oh yeah 
no topic specified yeah have a default yeah 
there are some there are some default actually 
the um a lot of people don't get their own ch and other stuff 
but 
yeah 
okay 
right 
y oh yeah that wouldn't be a problem 
and then you could do a search over the meetings over the objects 
'cause that's the thing these these are so small 
they can load each o all of the whole lot up and do a search of the whole lot to find who by who and what problem or what topics were in what 
so it doesn't crash the thing 
what the global statistics come straight off of that don't they 
'cause they're just for the meter met th the 
the speaker class knows about all of that stuff and the meeting class knows about that stuff 
um 
no no but i don't think that'll be too difficult 
what we want yeah 
i thought the other stuff was more important anyway so i did that first 
mm no design the gui first and uh 'cause it it w the problem is if you change the classes 
it the object's serial numbers change and you can't re load the object so all the processing has to be done over again 
and i haven't quite finished it 
so 
it would become out of synch and get a bit funny 
if i gave you one if i gave you it one and you worked on it 
and then i changed it and run the thing again you wouldn't ever be able to load the objects back up 
and you'd have to and then you'd have a v multiple copies of objects all over the place and it'd get silly i think 
but if you can if you wanna make the picture c you can do that without anything i'm presuming 
ju just the that yeah 
the text box 
'cause that doesn't okay 
alright 
well it won't take very long to get it all finished 
but i think i'll need to have done all of this stuff too first 
'cause otherwise the objects won't be the same 
no it's on my home directory 
yeah 
no i haven't global yet 
when it's finished up global otherwise it would get confusing 
that way it doesn't crash if you try and load all ten in one it crashes doesn't it 
it it's a bit dumb if you can fool it if you c if you c load up ten different si engines simultaneously 
it can do that fine 
but it can't do them it can't do them if it thinks one 
'cause then it's about the amount that each if you you have to kinda call a new class and then it will do it fine 
but if you don't then it won't l yeah it says okay oh yeah i've got all this space you can use some 
otherwise it goes oh no 
it talks to me yeah 
say nice machine it goes 
oh they're done are they 
okay cool 
they pop up 
uh yeah 
welcome to the l. s. n. l. s. d. browser 
some some some speech and some music some drum rolls 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
or a switch board that comes up that's just a blank form like that with some buttons on 
load me a meeting load me a search load me something else 
whistle a tune 
yeah 
hmm 
i that's cheaper than x. t. search 
it would need you to have a meeting loaded before it will start doing any searching at all doesn't it 
you can't the the only thing you can search is a nite object model and the only time you get one of those if you've loaded an observation 
yeah 
which we but doesn't that way c you cou you could use the inverted file search to return a list of of meetings and then use one of those to load a search 
but you won't 
it has to be an observation and even if you go and se you can go and search the whole corpus from that 
but you have to have it has to start with something for some bizarre reason 
the engine there's only one there's only one search method to the search engine 
uh the engine class only has one search method 
yeah yeah globally yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yep 
it doesn't take long to load up anyway 
you can load a dumb one up that doesn't have any 
exactly yeah 
yeah 
but only gives one at a time anyway doesn't it 
'cause otherwise you'll crash the thing 
yeah 
it's not too slow though that thing 
it shouldn't it's not it's not too bad on that 
i don't think that will be a much of a problem 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
ma make it strings for as long as possible and then only return the things when they actually needs to has to search 
when it needs to be loaded 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
did we think about um 
better names for the meetings 
oh do they do they re translate them 
do they 
okay well that's alright then 
we'll just use that then 
well that's what's the that's the working group is it 
okay 
i wanna see the meetings about even better understanding 
okay that's cool that's good 
so who would the the um i. d. f. s 
i mean the d. f. s 
the document frequencies for each word in the corpus 
yeah to do um what steve's talking about you do 
to do the topic labelling 
if somebody's done the keywords or the the g i. d. f. s or the d. f. s already would 
can't you do any better for our search without the t. f. i. d. f. 
i think you need to 
it's the amount that they occur over documents 
basically the amount they d. f. is the document frequency is the amount that each word occurs um no what is it 
term frequency is the amount that that it occurs in ea one of them is the amount it occurs in each document and the other one is the amount it g occurs generally 
so if you so the more it occurs in specific documents compared compared to its general score the bet more informative it is about a certain 
the corpus the corpus still data 
yeah 
no 
yeah 
yeah 
but plus a stop list so you remove stuff that doesn't ta it like yeah and then the which is gonna a a prob basically equal score 
or a massive 
bunch of key words 
that'd probably be easiest thing 
key words 
yeah key words three f three five words 
in both documents 
yeah term frequency inverse document frequency 
i did do it once i do have a java class that does it for something i don't know whether it'll work with this 
but 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
also key words gives you a a whole new type of search 
you do keyword search 
but you could do key word search could be topic search can they can be the same thing 
instead uh it would just search for key words when it when they you tell him that with topics but actually get searching with key words 
for each do you see what i mean 
but i suppose even calculating the the w the the what's its faces themselves would be too much too long 
the easy bit is it's probably the easiest to calculate them based upon in their whole occurrences in i in the corpus than it is to calculate them per topic 
'cause you don't have to integrate as much information 
no you can do you can do search without t. f. i. d. f. you just can't rank the search 
yeah 
no no no but that's what isn't that what the idea was in the first place to rank these rank the results so that 
yeah but that won't slow it down 
ranking it won't slow it down 
yeah 
it still uses an inverted file but it ranks the results by the amount by the higher yeah 
i thought that was part of it but yeah okay it doesn't matter if it's not 
um 
no we did yeah 
but yeah i guess uh if you do if if that's not part of it don't worry about it it doesn't 
'cause i'm only gonna do this if i've got time anyway 
so 
yeah 
well it'd just give you a rank 
it would that was the whole point was to if you say this is your top one this is your bottom 
yeah 
but say but it's how how informative 
that t. f. i. d. f. is an informative score isn't it 
so 
depends how you treat your compound nouns 
like what 
as a compound noun 
uh sunny day yeah 
and like an adjective yeah 
um 
in its most simple form it would do a separate rank for each one each term 
you could make it more complicated and make it do for th for the yeah 
yeah 
you can just add 'em up or you can 
yeah yeah 
yeah you don't wanna start looking for bo 
yeah 
um 
i guess you just do a sum of the um of the the individual t. f. i. d. f. for each term returned 
and that generally will be a bit crude but it will give you a d score 
and the higher the more uh more informative each term is for each thing would give you a 
a thing 
it's pretty crude anyway but it's just looking for um 
if it's all it's gonna do is look for six separate c oh 'cause then it's gonna go into the n. x. t. search and return that isn't it 
so mm yeah 
yeah yeah that's true 
so yeah that's less crude isn't it 
but um 
groups of terms 
yeah without doing any like um word pairs which is just omission 
yeah i don't know how that works 
that's how i remem yeah 
but then the idea is that gives you an informative score 
how you combine that is is up to you 
i guess it there's lots in the literature 
i if s if you were is there's a lo whole load about it in manning and schutz 
so they've got a whole chunk about it's so just i. r. isn't this 
basic information retrieval 
they've got a big a good chapter on it 
if you haven't got it it's on cognate 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
me too 
hundreds of p. d. f. s 
yeah 
okay 
do you want that on the start up screen yeah 
'cause 
yeah i guess so 
yeah yeah i guess that's useful 
uh you can have a save preferences 
you could have a save preferenc preferences i guess 
well alright call it favourites then 
you can have a favourites 
yeah it's not enough information is it to 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah it would be quite good if it has yeah 
just a b search buttons so just 
mm 
yeah yeah 
doofus mode 
or search yeah yeah 
so if even if it just had two things 
just said one sai one said take me straight to this meeting and have a m text box you can enter it or a drop down menu 
and then another that said search that loaded instantly 
it loaded up the search screen 
yeah 
yeah yeah or one that yeah or one that 
yeah 
yeah 
or the other thing to do is just have search as the default 
just it opens and the search window opens 
and that's the interface and you just go from there 
and then that brings up the browser after you f searched for something 
or or the search but the search window could have on it something that said just has a drop down menu that says just and a go button that said take me to this 
and so the f so the in yeah 
so the f only thing that comes up when you're finished is a um when you start it's just one window like that and it's got all the search stuff like down there 
and so this is your search 
it's just all here and here is just go to wherever and a go button 
and then from there it takes you to wherever else you wanna go 
yeah 
and the other topic says welcome to welcome to our browser 
a drop drop down menu 
oh you wanna have oh yeah the users 
they're always nonsense yeah 
yeah that's true 
yeah it does 
this is good but if you wanna search a search if you wanna look for one meeting and just look at it then that's fine 
um that's that's true that's or unless you have two 
one one is one one there where you got two one for meeting one to speak 
or and you can choose you can go go for go or go for the other 
go on go for both 
if you go for both you're searching 
yeah 
we could do microsoft stylie and hold it over and it pops up a thing 
is that complicated 
mouse over isn't it or something 
actually in this n oh let's do that then 
you get out of the bloody way i'm trying to do a search the damn thing 
yeah that's true that's annoying 
but that's why you could just have a list of your users then 
and just you just say i wanna look for this user 
go 
find me 
find me then then then it pulls up a list of all the ones who got that user in it 
and then you search then but then you didn't search 
maybe just leave it just have them there and don't worry about the speakers 
if they're doing speakers they're doing search 
it's not the same as doing a a quick access 
yeah 
or you can have a f text box there that's got yeah as you go over them 
then that doesn't get in your in the way 
yeah 
the full name and then speakers 
yeah 
we can do all of that without even ever going anywhere near loading up a 
i think 
oh cool 
and uh a thing 
a meeting a nom 
yeah 
i think it's in the right object model but i'm not sure 
no uh yeah is you're right it's the right corpus yeah 
it's the not right corpus and then you got not right elements in it 
got not right attributes in 
yeah 
i think the n. ones are interfaces and the nite one one of the ways round one's an interface and one's actually an implemented class 
uh 'cause you go back enough and the um the what's its name is not very good 
the a. p. i. is alright but there's not a lot of description in it 
it's very crude 
it tells you what 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so you end up just it saying returns an n. text box 
okay what's that 
doh 
it's a implementation of an n. text interface 
what's that 
oh it's a extended version of a stop it 
might be useful mightn't it 
yeah i should have more to talk about 
oh for next week 
no just after s. p. two 
yeah yeah 
i don't mean straight after 
yeah for that 
yeah that could be quite good 
right 
um 
friday morning 
three o'clock 
i don't know 
maybe i do i'm not sure what i'm doing this weekend 
um 
two 
should we say three o'clock and then if there's a v serious problem i'll tell you 
it's might not be too we th i don't think we need a probably 
three's better than five or six 
three so say three o'clock and then um if there's a problem with that 
then if three o'clock's a problem five or six will be a problem 'cause i won't be here 
but i don't think that won't be i'm not sure 
is she collecting them 
oh you're just sending it to no 
i mean is she collecting oh right oh yeah sorry 
yeah 
school for the gifted 
yeah 
well i thought somebody was collecting them 
but right well that's what i thought when you said that 
then we'd know who's missed them or who's if we've done any 
yeah 
no 
yeah that would help a lot for that s for single terms it would be very useful 
for multiple terms unless you wanna do something there will be a way of doing it for multiple terms 
yeah 
or you could do it and override it by the you ca you could just ignore the d ranking if it doesn't show up together 
or you could perhap you could penalize it you could just put a b weight against it 
yeah you do the n. x. t. so so it doesn't show up together 
either disregard it or put a weighting against it 
so if you g how many pairs you get you can 
yeah so then just next 
yeah 
yeah might have to talk to pernilla about that 
'cause some things you're gonna get a lot of results for 
and if the one that you got just happened to be at the bottom when it was actually the most relevant one 
something like that would just push it up 
yeah 
which is the highest exactly 
and um also with their something like sunny day 
the um if sunny and day aren't mentioned together a lot but sunny just happens to mentions once 
then its term will be low and it will push down the other one if you combine them 
if you just dup add them together 
yeah yeah 
but you have no ranking system at the moment so if something's an amazing w highly ranked thing from t. f. i. d. f. 
it could just be ignored because it falls off the bottom of the do you have a assuming you only have you have a return all results for all so you type language and it returns seventy five meetings 
yeah there are already seventy f but there are seventy five meeting 
yeah yeah 
so if it m so yeah if you return seventy five wh where do you stop 
how do you rank them or something 
or returns twenty even if it returns twenty do you cut off at ten do you rank them do you what's the threshold 
something like that would be 
look through them all yeah 
one at a time and 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
so is that it 
we're done 
tick 
i've signed off already 
'kay 
hmm 
did you wanna take a look at comments 
there's more uh 
yeah 
oh 
okay 
excellent 
okay right see ya 
okay 
yeah 
mm 
'kay 
um one thing that i was wondering is there a standard control that you use to connect the different things 
like if you're in a topic and it goes and highlights the topic in the text or whatever 
is there a particular type of control that like is there one of these n. x. t. or sorry um nite controls 
n. o. m. or 
okay 
mm 
you haven't had to build any new windows to do that sort of thing 
like other topics or well we're gonna do one for speaker i guess and all the rest right 
or no 
no 
well okay um when we talk about speaker characterization how are we accessing the list of speakers 
okay 
right 
hmm 
okay 
okay 
okay 
yeah 
actually i know that might also help 
like when he was talking about like have an architecture that things are gonna plug into 
i mean so that things are all modular i mean it would be a good idea if we used that same idea for anything else we do 
or what else are we doing 
um actually even the searches or whatever you know just any sort of thing 
i mean search results if they're all in a predictable thing with a name certain properties or a list of properties a vector 
whatever 
um 
mm right 
h um yeah 
yeah 
just a matter of deciding what we what would be easiest all the way around i mean 
oh 
right 
okay 
strange 
right 
hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
so each time are you going straight to the x. m. l. files for for the information or right 
oh well 
oh i see 
okay i see 
okay right 
right okay 
so it's all just pre processed and just okay 
thanks 
right 
okay 
right 
okay 
that's cool 
yeah right 
right 
is this is it for the entire corpus 
or is it just like individual ones like t one fi one object for okay 
that's nice 
oh each meeting okay 
alright 
wonder if that would be useful for some of the other stuff we're doing 
well yeah 
no 
no no 
just 
right okay 
okay 
yeah 
alright 
or just return a null or a blank or a blank string or something yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
alright 
yeah 
right 
okay 
it's a good idea 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
'kay 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
actually i can up load my stuff as well i just have to make one change to your file 
just to load this one instead of the the default 
so it's two lines of code 
so 
um what do you mean 
well yeah just the one thing that's like the action for loading up the search thing 
yeah 
well your version yeah yeah 
yes 
no 
i did in my directory just uh just do that yeah 
um i have a copy yes 
i'm yeah 
but i will yeah i was going to update that one just 'cause yeah it just makes sense that then you then you can test out yeah 
right 
right yeah and then update 
yeah 
yeah i haven't i haven't made any changes to it yet 
so yeah 
um yeah i'll just make that one and i'll let you know 
'cause yeah like i say two lines of code if that 
so anyways um and then you can play 
there's not much to do yet 
but have to get better results like better presented 
yeah 
yeah and just um to wire in the the topics and uh summaries 
so um yeah that's pr well also yeah like that that as well 
so yeah 
yeah 
just wanna find out what kind of objects those were that um for the other ones 
so it goes in and highlights 'cause that's i know 
hmm 
oh yeah 
okay 
right 
okay 
okay sounds good 
um so yeah just a few more things to do with that and then uh once pernilla gets the uh the index 
um then that's gonna be kind of fun 
like i'm just wondering have you had to well the way you're doi i was gonna ask if the way you were doing it 
you were loading like a new corpus each time for each meeting but you're doing the objects 
so you don't need to just uh 'cause if we're if we do have t like if the inverted search says that there's you know 
ten documents are we gonna have to load each of these ten corp corpora just to um do the individual next uh n. x. t. search 
yeah i think probably yeah 
are you serious 
that's a 
yeah okay 
that's insane 
'kay 
right okay 
okay 
oh yeah 
okay 
okay 
oh 
okay 
hmm 
or just or is it more like right 
oh right yeah exactly 
it doesn't take too long no 
just we have to yeah while we're debugging we'll probably be getting sick of it 
um but no or something that just sort of guides them to the most obvious things 
yeah 
hmm 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah right 
mm should mm 
yeah 
i was just gonna ask if we should assume that they all wanna load a meeting first but not necessarily 
i guess if they're doing a search on the entire yeah corpus 
yeah that kinda makes sense 
right 
well we can put the logic in a yeah 
i could probably even that s shouldn't be too hard to put a check in there 
and if it hasn't loaded then force him to load one 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
unless they know what meeting it is 
well yeah it's hard to 
yeah 
yeah 
or well the things they may n just be looking for a word or whate you know like and if it shows up ten different meetings 
then at that point they'll probably wanna like we do we want to like if it dumped by default goes with the first one and they want number five of the ones that are returned 
i mean then they have to go through the 
well no t like to load up like the thing is that i think 
uh like when it loads up it'll load up the transcript window and the whatever other window 
right now i think just the topic ones 
um although the time is probably more um caused by loading the actual data 
so i'm just thinking if it's kinda like you were saying you have to have a nom object right 
i mean before you do a search at all on this 
yeah 
okay right yeah 
that's true yeah 
yeah but the okay the global one feeds into the local 
um so if we're getting any usable data it's it's gonna be doing a search on each of those files 
so it's gonna be loading up each of those one at a time to get the data that we wanna 
right 
but it's it could be time consuming like if there are ten documents that hit with this thing then 
oh 
um yeah well i'm j just thinking of some way we could you know 
st cash the results and in a nice little format that'll make things a bit easier 
but the thing is i mean if we've got that then it's gonna be needing really really to load the entire corpus for that meeting 
if uh if it's trying to show us where those were if it's trying to highlight those in the text transcript or whatever 
and we're gonna have to have all that other data in there 
so each time when we have a she search window and we have like you know 
ten different meetings you know with the word wireless comes up 
go to meeting one then it has to reload the nom object 
next one 
i mean that's gonna that could be yeah 
okay right 
it always seems to be slow loading up the first time at least like that's all i i've been doing lately is just sort of loading it up 
test it try something else and then shut down load it up 
but so um so just sorta based on that as a yeah 
but uh if it doesn't take that long each time then that should be f alright 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah right 
yeah 
yeah 
that's true 
yeah 
that 
yeah 
yeah that makes sense 
and that way if they know specifically which meaning it is then that'll save the time 
because i'm sure they don't wanna have the extra loading time either if they could avoid it 
so yeah or they could check mark against the ones they wanna check 
so 
well i think they were in the text 
we can probably do that ourselves and just sort of b. d. b. you know just do a a string 
yeah the long names 
yeah yeah 
like the the working group that it's part of 
yeah 
that probably even might have a 
yeah 
yeah right 
see if it's accurate 
um do we actually need the uh the frequencies 
yeah 
oh right that 
right 
yeah okay 
yeah 
well thing is if it's being done there were there was 
yeah 
there's a @'s trying to get uh to work on friday 
um they did have all that and it was sorta built in and just uh had some trouble getting it running properly 
um but it had sort of all that standard sort of stuff but it w it last i heard it wasn't working 
so she was gonna look at you know more straight forward sorta thing that really just fulfils what we need it to do 
but if we need the if we do need the frequencies then 
um i don't know 
um well it was would've been like a list of 
what's it stand for 
hmm 
mm 
well the corpus yeah 
so yeah the probably probably term frequency 
yeah so the general one is pr yeah yeah 
right 
actually what's the i. in t. f. i. d. f. 
really 
okay 
oh yeah 
alright 
yeah 
uh-huh 
right 
oh yeah 
well do we need to 
i mean we're just looking oh for for your s for your stuff i guess yeah 
for topic with 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
i don't think we had that in the the document 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
i know 
hmm 
right 
yeah b nice to have 
mm-hmm 
right 
mm 
well i don't know 
actually 'cause the thing is i mean typically yeah 
but th um the thing is we're just looking for when it happens in a meeting if they're looking for particular term or something 
they just wanna know if that term exists there and where does it exist and i wanna see it you know 
yeah 
'kay 
but if it's like a two word term does the t. f. i. d. f. handle that 
it's not a compound noun it's just two words together 
um in f i don't know 
i don't know 
just something like uh edinburgh university 
yeah 
well essentially i don't know 
or sunny day 
you know 
hmm 
let's not make it more complicated 
yeah 
because the thing is the thing is that the way we were doing it we were just looking for the words 
period each word in the um in the index 
well that's way we were thinking about it 
and then then it's just saying were these two words in in any of these documents 
and then if it was then we go closer and do the the n. x. t. search uh to look for the exact term or the regular expression or whatever 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
or we choose the list of meetings that we wanted to search to do that 
so yeah 
um 
like i'm just wondering if if it's gonna give us something cool then yeah absolutely 
but if it's sort like if the n. x. t. search has still gotta be run to find these terms or these you know these patterns then uh 
or also like do um wild cards work for something like that 
so if you're looking for wireless wired wire blah blah blah you do wire with a star and um no 
not y actually that's a problem for me too 
so or pernilla 
and uh 
yeah 'cause 
actually it should work yeah 
okay then i'm just yeah 
sure that's not too bad 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
okay 
yeah i've got uh somewhere p. d. f. 
yeah what if it's yeah 
do the p. d. f. s switch it to postscript switch it back to p. d. f. and then 
don't know 
okay so that's okay that might be good 
alright 
okay 
oh i thought we sort of dis you know what i mean 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
or attended yeah 
p probably for the most part i mean there'll be a set of people that do and then a sub set for each meeting probably 
search for stuff or start working or no 
or or browse okay like search browse um 
like if you're looking for something speci like is that what you're thinking 
like if they if they know exactly where they wanna go they wanna go to you know that meeting on december third 
and they just wanna go there and see stuff then they can immediately go and browse that 
um 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
browse by meeting browse by blah browse by speaker 
like did no i'm just thinking of different ways we can do that like different buttons on the top 
like if they're looking for particular person particular working group particular whatever 
i mean we just uh we could break things down like that to that level of detail if we want 
or we could keep a more general 
yeah 
um yeah but i'm just thinking like initially when they load up 
what are the range of things that they'd wanna do 
like if they're part of x. working group they'll wanna get in there 
um do we wanna save preferences 
well if they're part of b. d. b. working group they're gonna wanna look at the b. d. b. ones and so we'd default to that 
or don't know 
based on what they did the last time 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
yeah okay right 
yeah 
yeah okay yeah that's yeah 
right 
what was that 
yeah exactly 
i forget 
right 
um okay 
well no i'm just getting back to sorta what could be on the the start up screen 
like there is just a range of things we could do we could have like search options browse options 
i mean just i don't know just playing around with ideas 
um and then we can tie this into our evaluation uh tasks and say well if you want to search for a meeting or search for a user in a particular meeting 
then do this blah blah blah 
so we can yeah sort of um you know guide them 
and just like hey my task is to do this and there's a button for it 
oh p perfect 
you know 
you know 
i don't know 
no no that's not what i'm suggesting 
no i'm just saying like these are just like a lot of programmes well kind of lame programmes do have that sort of thing first 
just 'cause they don't want people to have to go through all the menus and search themselves and just like do commonly used tasks or just exit and just let me use the programme 
you know as well 
so 
probably or search something 
yeah 
yeah like find specific meeting 
you know that's an easy sort of thing and 
mm 
mm-hmm 
fits his criteria 
well we don't actually have user names do we 
aren't there all these codes like ami eleven or whatever 
yeah 
yeah 
in a case like that we do want drop down 
we don't want them to type them do we 
okay 
um and allow multiple 
no 
okay you're just looking for one specific speaker right 
yeah 
okay 
alright 
oh for speakers 
oh 
mm-hmm 
a tool tip 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
'cause 
yeah that's true 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah just so yeah 
that's like nice and easy 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
right 
just yeah 
just but it's i think in that case it's the wr write corpus 
is that what it is 
writable corpus or something 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and n. x. t. something and 
oh 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
area yeah 
yeah drove you crazy 
oh god 
hmm 
um not really just gonna keep on going 
like friday afternoon or something 
okay 
then we won't have to have the meeting with steve on tuesday 
or at all 
yeah 
so do we wanna arrange this get this one earlier maybe 
three or i don't know 
yeah that's true 
true 
mm 'kay yeah sure 
um 
hmm 
possibly i don't know 
usually by then it's need a break 
um although well i don't know 'cause it's the lab and try and get some work done for the the lab stuff 
yeah 
oh okay 
ten to two 
or th three o'clock 
or no or you wanna get out 
get away 
okay right 
'cause i think she's got a class at eleven 
we've all got cla well three of us have class at twelve 
um could go 
or if we could try one 
we could try shortly after 
well yea yeah well yeah 
well it wouldn't be a long meeting then 
or no 
would you wanna no probably not 
if one's bad for you then it won't okay 
right okay 
yeah yeah 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
um there's just sorta the basic implementation stuff that i was wondering about 
but um no it should be fine 
um it's just progressing 
um we d did we decide whether it should be ranked 
no 
for now 
'cause 
yeah 
well i d i kinda think it would complicate things quite a bit and not bring us a lot 
just because if it is like independently doing the words for a particular document it's not it's not really getting them together 
like if someone's looking for a particular term 
um i don't know it just i just don't know if it would bring us that much 
how so 
if if if they're looking for like i say sunny day and 
you know sunny shows up in this document day shows up but they're not together 
um or if if they are toge i don't know 
it just doesn't you're looking for that term and relevance is kind of irrelevant because if the term shows up it shows up 
hmm 
right 
in in that sense for single for single word yeah yeah 
yeah 
well create a new yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well but you still have to do the search 
you still have to do the n. x. t. search then right 
if if it doesn't show up 
yeah yeah i know 
yeah 
oh yeah yeah it'll yeah yeah 
well it wouldn't show up on the search results if it if it didn't exist together 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
we'll have we'll have to talk to pernilla about this then just 'cause uh see how she's uh doing this 
'cause if we are using that i mean it does make sense for that but uh yeah and just actually yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well that's sorta what is yeah that's true 
well the thing is also i mean if it's well yeah 
yeah okay i see what you mean 
um and then we could actually put that like on the list of um meetings that r get returned 
if there were fifteen meetings with language is in then it's gonna show you those and rank them as to which is the highest 
so okay i see that 
hmm 
yeah 
well the thing is i mean that'll be exactly how we're doing it now 
like we're just looking for the two words separately see if they exist in the same document 
if they do then there's a possibility that they c occur together 
and then we do the n. x. t. search on that document 
yeah no 
hmm 
um well right now it's not doing anything 
so i don i don't know i don't know what what it's doing 
but yeah 
well i thou yeah 
yeah i think so 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that's true 
okay 
hmm look through them all 
well 
yeah 
i think so 
okay 
yeah 
mm 
forget every time that the 
where did my oh it's it's stuck here 
yeah 
okay 
keep an eye if i'm dropping this 'cause just seem ah as i said it doesn't seem very s perhaps sweater 
or maybe if i set it here on the this brand thing 
are they on yeah 
on 
okay 
what 
was that a answer 
well okay 
i was just about to 
you could change your project 
do a p. h. d. or uh yeah 
i haven't created it 
i i do 
yeah 
shoulda run the i. l. in that directory 
yeah 
sounds good 
oh 
it's good thing 
yeah 
yeah 
i'll do it 
hey zoe 
it's good 
who 
what 
okay 
it's just very quiet 
oh 
yeah 
it's like i'm only interested in this guy 'cause he seems to be funny 
so what is it 
like instead of the 
oh 
we have the g big yellow one maybe 
no huh 
yeah 
yeah that would be good 
ah no 
oh 
yeah 
we have to remember to include that in our evaluation how they did the gif improve your browsing experie 
sorry 
i guess that's why we have a separate speech lab 
yeah 
yeah um 
'kay 
yeah 
yeah 
i ran in some troubles with the indexing but uh f found another package i instead of writing it from um the scratch 
'cause it well i don't know um just now but i haven't played around it that much 
but 
we'll see what happens in the next few days 
yeah we'll think about that 
i can send you right now 
like 
um 
c. 
yeah 
yeah 
i didn't expect this course to be so much about java 
but uh feels like it's it's a java course more than anything else 
it's just like 
yeah 
so 
we change it to friday 
yeah 
i guess that's not 
yeah 
no 
so we 
yeah that would be more reasonable 
'cause the i. l. is friday 
what 
oh yeah you have your presenta right whatever 
it's too much now 
well but yeah monday 
we'll try and do monday 
um i mean we could 
should we meet up monday 
or 
should we 
yeah 
just sh like w 
yeah 
just 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
well so he's supposed to give us test subject 
did he say that or what 
okay 
'cause we're gonna get an email on our uh m. s. c. list saying from steve we need volunt yeah 
yeah 
well th they gonna u need us 
they're gonna need us for like perception projects and things like that 
so yeah 
we need to use each other for those 
yeah that's true 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
and then one's supposed to be a woman 
and one's supposed be a man 
and one i don't know 
oh yeah 
yeah okay 
should we just yeah 
yeah 
yeah it's tuesday the twenty second 
yeah 
i think so 
well uh 
what 
oh it's a thursday 
yeah 
so it's not the yeah 
it's not a good friday if if that's 
it's not a good friday if it's a deadline 
no 
can have a look 
the report yeah 
no okay 
oh 
no we p 
i thought we would 
oh 
yeah 
oh we have three 
s. p. two 
aren't you 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
in our uh timeline we r put in twenty fifth and that's the friday i think 
yeah 
i'm just that's why i'm trying to find his his dates 
whatever 
we're planning on having a big party on the twenty fourth 
so 
end of lectures 
oh it's actually twenty fourth 
yeah 
did he say anything about like h what he expects of the final report and stuff 
like length or 
only 
i mean how long we're this 
one two 
yeah 
'cause this i mean we have interim report of seven pages and that's we can y yeah 
we could p probably just expand that 
i mean 'cause it i mean a lot of it's gonna be the same thing 
yeah 
and then i mean write about the evala evaluation and stuff 
that's gonna be quite a few pages 
but 
so i don't think 
page is gonna be problem 
but uh 
mm 
can i have it 
well the one meeting 
um it should be fairly simple to just get the topics and the summaries fro using that text extractor thingy you wrote ray 
you just like or 
yeah 
excuse me 
i just realised i haven't done that part yet 
to have for the start up 
oh 
to have for the start up 
uh-huh 
yeah g uh that was li like yeah if i'll make a just index 
what 
well i i mean i i'm f it's not first priority maybe but don't know 
but uh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i guess we just 
see what steve says about the re evaluation and then like we'll keep in touch by email if we need 
anything 
i guess we will see you on thursday 
and monday 
d. n. l. g. 
we can just email if we need other 
i guess 
hooray 
okay 
oh dear this doesn't stick at all 
what rena 
what this bit or this b 
like this 
i sabotaged it 
yeah mine doesn't stick today either 
who wants to write summary 
oh 
i'll do it 
um have you changed the the file yet 
oh 
yeah 
yeah i forgot that actually 
yeah 
no when we um when you said at the beginning i thought must check the read write and then i never did it 
no 
alright 
mm-hmm 
mm g yeah 
uh 
yeah 
yeah yeah exactly yeah 
yeah 
make browsers for the rest of the night 
there is a file in the directory called disful 
i ho what is it 
oh right 
yeah that's right yeah yeah 
oh right 
well 
j do you want remo move that just n just for nicety 
yeah yeah 
and really 
oh it's huge several gig i think 
yeah something like that yeah 
has anyone had time to to play with it 
any comments 
um 
oh right 
might as well yeah 
i mean yeah 
the thing is that yeah there is as i said a while ago 
there is still this one error which is a bug in in n. x. t. um that r r always generates these 
i think when you when you left click or right click or something i can't remember now 
um but if it's a real error then it it stops so you can't do any any more 
good 
good 
good 
yeah 
okay 
yeah be good 
is there any any comments you have about just like wording and or some sort of minor things 
hmm 
yeah i know 
at the moment as well the whole windows that pop up are not pretty at all 
but um you know i would make them a bit nice if i had more time but at the moment it doesn't look like that 
so i will if 
but that took me so long to do this bloody start window 
nasty 
so i'm quite glad that it looks you know ni nice on one or this kind of thing 
no this is just yeah 
alright 
that's odd yeah 
try that a few times 
yeah i started i started using your um um the speak i don't know if you've seen that in the yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
but it's good your your stuff is really coo good 
it's got a good interface and easy to use 
it's nice 
right 
well wouldn't won't we include that then 
yeah 
it's when they say mm uh-huh yeah 
yeah 
i don't know if that's very useful because everyone does it 
it's very 
really 
they're asleep i think 
so which you know suggest maybe you can suggest a few that which which would be interesting to list 
like three or four or something 
mm-hmm 
very nice 
mm-hmm 
but 
i mean do we do we care if you know why not w i think you know it'd be it'd be difficult 
but it would be difficult if you know if in the um speaker characterisation window we had a heading you know top five dialogue acts 
and then then the little brackets but they're not actually the top five but top five minus the most common ones which are you know 
because 
for the speaker 
yeah 
no i wouldn't yeah 
exactly yeah 
yep 
yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah just do top five both local and global and then have another 
um but then we want a selection of three or four maybe interesting ones and then 
you followed all this up 
yeah see and that's what speaker characterisation gives you 
who's the one who dr 
yeah 
yeah 
um so is is this percentage then um if you say like um joke for this speaker is percentage 
i don't know twenty is that the ho what percentage of his speech is joke or w how what percentage of the jokes 
are jokes 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i mean just keep it simple as 
um 
you will yeah 
yeah 
sounds good 
yeah i was thinking that um it sort of turned out that way a bit didn't it 
i don't know 
does it matter 
oh i was 
mm 
i have one one m one little question that i reckon we should have a little icon for our browser 
well no the thing is um in yeah in the the top left 
at the moment they've got an x. which is you know n. x. t. and it's sort of a bit cheeky to use that 
so 
no we want something original 
what do you suggest 
we could the only thing i could think of was an m. 
but 
we'd be sued for that i think 
yeah 
yeah um 
i mean it's tiny so we can't really put more than one character really or one sort of simple gif 
no 
well i can dr 
yeah 
well if you find anything then send it to me 
otherwise i'll i'll make up some m. 
i'm not sure actually 
i'm thinking yeah 
yeah yeah yeah i i know yeah i know how to how to put it there 
but i'll have to import it somehow 
i'm not quite sure 
but 
yeah yeah probably 
yes 
oh yes 
no 
no uh 
if 
if the sound card is registered to your name which it usually is not and you have to re boot and sometimes it still doesn't work then yeah 
um 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
in fact it's a n. x. t. package 
yeah 
i mean sometimes they have methods that don't have any explanation to them at all 
so you just like right i'll try this then and see what it gives me 
hmm 
friday 
i thought it was friday 
yeah i think we both should yeah 
well that's the problem because steve hasn't given us any details has he 
that's true 
i i'm sure we could do that in like a meeting 
and make it up together 
yeah 
um 
the thing is yeah we had the the deadline last friday 
but we won't be able to do any evaluation during the weekend anyway so i think we could set monday 
and that would give us the whole weekend 
i don't know 
i think it was 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly yeah 
at the end we'll say yeah but you never gave us any test subjects 
well sort of that's how i understood it 
he would he would make something up 
ha yeah find some people that's how i understood it 
um the thing is you know 
yes 
um i think if we if we don't get anything from him then we should just do our friends basically 
well they're your friends so they should 
but it's not gonna take long 
it's only only gonna be half an hour maybe 
um 
maybe yeah 
well it will be 
yeah 
it'll have to be yeah 
hmm 
so 
really 
i was thinking of like ten 
fifteen 
uh 
really 
really 
how can you get a range of people if you have three 
one art student 
yeah 
yeah 
and hen we should just have two 
yeah 
oh dear 
um 
another thing um we have the we have the um the presentation on like in one and a half weeks or something whatever it is 
or nearly two weeks 
oh is tu yeah it is two weeks then 
do we have to have done the evaluation by then 
it's the thursday 
no the thursday i think 
i think it's the thursday 
is that good friday already 
wow 
no 
well it i'm sure on the web site it says thursday 
hmm 
well you know the the question is i do we need the evaluation for the presentation 
we should definitely ask him 
because if not then 
yeah you might be right 
because we need to write a presentation as well 
exactly me too 
that's the point 
yeah 
yeah 
well i'm not free after this monday but i'm free at like after the eighteenth 
because because i don't have anything after the eighteenth apart from this 
well that's in on the eighteenth 
mm-hmm 
ooh 
so um 
so 
anyone fancy writing him an email 
that yep 
and 
but it's still important to know 
so we would def 
yeah yeah yeah 
i mean we need to know that anyway to prepare the presentation in the first place 
and um 
what was the other one 
basically how is how is it going with your evaluation proposal 
have you got people yet for us or what are you thinking and when 
no 
do we know did he ever say how long it was supposed to be 
mm it's gonna be a lot 
but we can write a lot 
i mean i think we should we should write everything 
seven pages 
oh 
true 
yeah we can n 
yeah should be good 
so do you wanna write him an email then 
that'd be good 
um 
and uh when i get home today which will be before 
um 
before half past six i will make that file readable writable everything 
uh uh 
well i i will 
well i will i will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if i had them by tomorrow evening 
oh i was gonna ask um 
at the moment your search window 
how is it organised 
but at the beginning it when you haven't searched yet 
is it is it just is it still divided into two and the bottom half is just just empty 
okay 
and then if you i don't know double click on one 
okay 
yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
hmm 
well y y this this is the icon by the way 
um yeah maybe you wanna do um left handed um yeah one left click um highlights the the result in whatever you've got open 
which other ones 
um yeah 
usually one left click it's highlights it cross highlights everything i think 
yeah 
mm well it's difficult because 
well you could look up 
mm no that's difficult 
because it the transcription window does cross highlighting 
in a very awkward way because it has to find the topic first 
that was that was a pain 
and um when you when you g um right click on a topic it pops open the list of meetings that contain that pop po topic 
and um and that works when you when you left double click on a topic oh on a meeting sorry then it loads it 
so you could 
you could take that for loading 
so if we have that um the same on this one at least that you if you double left lick then it loads 
mm 
highlights um yeah 
i mean a hi obviously highlights whatever you've clicked on here but also highlights um 
actually it's difficult because 
because you n you don't you only ever have one meeting open and those results will be op i well i suppose if you have a if you have a local search 
then it could cross highlight 
because you know if you get back several different meetings here and you've only got one meeting open then you can't cross out anything 
okay 
what do you mean by multi select 
mm-hmm 
oh okay 
oh i see what you mean yeah 
okay 
well i i i in any case if you left click on on a result that is contained in the meeting that is currently open then it should cross highlight 
if not it can't 
so 
can you make 
is it d very difficult to make another another gui but only for a global search 
just just take that away the the local check box 
because um hmm 
yeah because in the start up screen you can't have a 
yeah would you make that 
that'd be really handy 
everything else can just stay the same you know 
in fact you can just leave everything as it is and just remove the check box 
radio button 
mm 
okay 
are we done 
hmm 
okay 
ooh there you go 
doesn't wanna stay 
yeah 
no it won't 
yeah 
the fun and games 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
seems unlikely 
it's an excel s s. x. dot x. s. l. 
doesn't st have anything in it oh it does it has about three lines of x. m. l. that didn't do much i think 
yeah 
what's that 
it just seems to be occupied 
the place is alright doesn't matter really 
there's plenty in there 
i had lots of stuff in there yesterday that did you see 
loads of stuff 
oh no they live there but there's i had even more stuff there yesterday 
i was unzipping all this kind of crazy huge things that were enormous 
i needed them they were for this though 
it's alright but uh 
yeah it's uh it's about yeah it's so i think there's about eight gigs on there 
so yeah it's no problem 
it's just much bigger than all of our home directories combined isn't it 
yeah 
i had a play with it um yesterday 
uh no it was good really 
yeah i liked it 
um 
uh 
it uh generated a lot of exceptions in the background 
but they didn't cause any problems but it just 
uh yeah i didn't discover any of those yeah 
i did have a look 
i prodded it to see if it'd break but it didn't break too m i didn't play that long but um it seemed alright really yeah 
and it the the th the start up's great looks quite good looks alright 
and so yeah yeah 
no looked alright 
the only the only thing is the it's not the start up screen is not too pretty 
but uh the the s it doesn't matter too much 
no it's not it's not it's not a um it's not the top priority is it 
yeah 
i think it'd look better on windows as well actually 
'cause um it java uses the native windows doesn't it 
so 
yeah 
but we don't 
no 
do they 
yeah 
well the um the um speaker characterisation is finished 
i haven't done it i haven't updated all those object files though 'cause it takes ages on these computers 
so i do it it's faster for some bizarre reason if i log in at home and then run the code 
it runs it much faster than if i do it here 
but 
but that's why i just can't to sit in the lab and wait half an hour or whatever it takes 
yeah 
no i tried that but l yeah 
it'll really speed it up 
yeah 
yeah 
i saw that yeah 
i saw that it it doe it's tells tells you what speakers uh are in which meeting and then you can see which topics which topics yeah 
something like that yeah 
yeah 
the um th the dialogue acts are all done and they're quite amusing some of them 
but there's some of them some of th the thing actually what i wanted to talk about dialogue acts was um there are some that occur all the time that i just and i don't know how interesting there are 
so the fir one statement is that it will b i'd removed it 'cause w it was like everything is prefixed by statement 
every single dialogue act starts with statement and um so everybody's top statement 
so it 
so i got rid of that 
and then everybody the next one seems to mostly be back channel 
well i don't know what that means 
who knows what back channel 
is that what that means 
oh keep that then 
um and then the others are quite 
yeah 
some people don't though 
there are some people who don't do that 
actually yeah you can see that they don't do that and it's the bottom of their list 
yeah 
i know 
some people have and acknowledgement is a big one that comes up all the time yes no questions 
um uh what else comes up 
yeah 
but that's the thing and so i wanted to know whether or not we 'cause at the moment you can get there's a method that will just give you the top five for or the top x. 
you give it any number and it will give you the top whatever for each person 
and then each meeting knows about all the different dialogue acts for each person in the meeting and the amount that that occurred 
and will give you that in top order as well or will give you or you can just search for each specific dialogue act 
do you have to search on in b. s and k. s rather than real words right at the moment 
but i can change that 
um so i don't know what we want to display 
that's what i m that's what i'm asking you really 
all's a lot all's like twenty five 
dialogue acts per b 
yeah 
i think we should have the global top five that cause it each speaker's got top a top whatever 
and so just say one of the boxes just explains does this is my top five dialogue acts for the speaker 
and then in the meeting you have what you could either have the most commonly occurring ones or you could have a list of each speaker's top dialogue acts 
either of those would do you 
but it would start take a lot of space if you have it 
or you could have no you don't need that 
so you s 'cause it's 'cause it's a speaker window the speaker characterisation window comes up 
so you've got the global one there and then here you can just have the top five in this meeting 
and then then the top five in that meet in global the top five this meeting and then the rest is r obvious isn't it 
yeah 
that occur 
but you th some often the interesting ones don't occur things like joke don't occur very often 
well they do sometimes but they're not that common 
one guy has top five joke 
one of them is joke 
he's an undergrad 
that's quite funny 
yeah 
yeah it's interesting isn't it 
yeah 
he's the joker 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
yeah 
that'd be quite good wouldn't it 
yeah 
what percentage of the dialogue acts that he makes are jokes in the meeting and globally separately so once globally 
yeah 
um i think most things are coded with a dialogue act 
a lot of them are coded with z. which means no label 
so i just ignored that as well 
'cause that's boring 
and statement which is boring 
and also the other thing that they have is um if somebody quotes something so if i quote a joke to you they separate that 
so they put they put the the dialogue act and then they put a double a colon and they put that aside 
just ignored anyth any quoted material 'cause it's got nothing to do with i just scrapped it 
yeah yeah yeah somebody else's joke 
so yeah you have to be original about your material 
otherwise we don't credit it to you 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that's all done yeah 
all done yeah 
um yeah i just have to i'll just finish there might be some polishing 
i can't remember 
but i think it's pretty much complete done 
so i'll do that tonight 
just put it up there 
so you can us start using that whenever 
no i just well it's called meeting and speaker 
well i can judge it if you want 
yeah 
we could put it in a sep in a p package 
if you can be bothered 
well it doesn't seem to make any differ i've never ever used java packages 
doesn't even make any difference 
as long as in the same directory it works 
so sod it 
right 
well then you can double click on and it oh oh 
no 
yeah it will have something else 
just borrow a little microsoft gif like that 
m. b. 
where have i seen that before 
yeah 
yeah anything you like yeah 
do you think we'd be doing uh m. s. c. s in informatics if we did 
some people do yeah 
yeah 
that's really easy 
you do it in um one of the w whatever the main is it you set w gif or some set f set set picture or something 
it's really simple 
yeah i think you just give it a file name and it tells it it knows 
yeah yeah it just sticks it in the corner 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
it could even have some sound when it comes on 
it go welcome to the meeting browser 
no that's problem 
have to do it in the 
not no but i think if you put headphones in it will just play just normally 
yeah 
yeah 
sometimes it works yeah 
yeah 
i still can't make it run t. n. t. from java 
yeah you try it 
if you can make it work then i'll be well chuffed 
it's a java course 
course yeah 
right 
yeah i think it was 
so what does 
yeah 
and it uh it's was apparently generated by going to d generate javadoc and it just went spat it all out and they never bothered to uh d comment anything 
yeah 
at least get to know what methods are there 
so without having to look at the source codes 
yeah yeah 
what 
yes that's it right here 
today wasn't it 
it's the eighth 
okay 
don't know 
maybe it's just a day i don't know 
send him an email 
he'll probably re do it anyway 
so 
yeah w 
he said he might he would try 
yeah 
hmm 
so how many people do we uh try and 'cause it 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
no it'll take forever and then you gotta analyse the results 
no no no no no forget it 
yeah but one computer scientist one l and one dude off the street 
yeah one man one woman yeah 
yeah 
two weeks 
two two two weeks today 
yeah 
when's the report hand in 
is oh right is that th is that the friday 
the twenty fourth then 
yeah 
yeah yeah that's good friday 
yeah 
mm 
oh we should have it we should try and have at it done by then anyway i think 
otherwise it will start to getting b bit tight otherwise 
we should aim to be finished by monday this monday coming 
a week no yeah well basically for tuesday 
start the evaluation t pretty much straight away and then get 
get s yeah and then get um 
we have to write the report yeah and everything 
we have to write everything 
yeah 
s. p. two 
and you must have your research proposal 
is that in on the eighteenth 
shit 
i've not done at all yeah 
hmm 
yeah you have to start again 
it's just do topics instead of seg yeah you have to get the topics out instead of the segments 
uh yeah 
to you're gonna be able to do a global search for topics 
is that what you mean yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah yeah 
okay 
yeah i didn't think you'd bother with that but yeah cool 
i didn't think we're gonna bother with that 
but yeah 
yeah it does isn't it 
yeah 
yeah 
what 
with 
well we'll certainly do it enough to make it so we can do some numerical analysis on the yeah but at at the very least 
no 
exactly 
yeah 
uh yeah 
no we won't be doing that 
well yeah even if even if i happen to manage to make it decent keywords 
i don't think we can expect you to also come up with the search thing for it as well 
so 
would yeah 
but if i collate yeah 
yeah if i create x. m. l. files but if i m i'm not gonna do that 
um i did have a look at trying to create x. m. l. files 
it did look like a quite a a mission really 
i suppose it's not it's it's as straightforward as writing in x. m. l. files 
but it's but it's organising the segment data though 
it would just looks so complicated to get it from 
the um from a plain text file back into organise it by who which speaker speaks what and how n doing the segment i think that was the stupidest way they could ever have organised the whole thing if you ask me 
but organise it by time not by speaker 
but yeah 
but 
so i don't know really what we're gonna do about that 
yeah we don't 
do we need another meeting this week 
mm 
mm 
wanna go today 
ooh 
yeah seems slippery 
what day is it 
okay 
summary 
um no 
no just the summary 
no that was just summary 
no 
um no um okay 
oh write the sum okay right 
yeah okay 
i did i was trying to i didn't have privileges to get in to update your file 
i w i actually meant to i meant to send the email and then i was just c didn't get around to it 
yeah i had yeah 'cause i forget mine as well and it's just like you know every time put something in there 
um so yeah i was j yeah 
that was the main thing so um as soon as that's in it'll be right out 
i was making a couple of little change as well 
so so those will be able to play with 
still working on the um trying to get the topics and summary search implemented as well 
so that's that's sorta tonight as well 
so um yeah 
other than that it's sorta coming along 
um getting a better feel for all these nite objects 
it's just i don't know it seems a little chaos 
i don't know it's just it's um i don't know it's it's like if you're gonna use this stuff later on in your life 
then you t spend the time to invest and learn all about them but it's like okay wow 
what's the minimum i can get away with that that will get me what we need 
so it's like i don't know unless i wanna do something with this in the future 
yeah right 
yeah mm 
i don't know 
anyways so um yeah that's my bad 
i th 
i think i yeah 
i i saw that and i'm just trying to remember if i did create it 
'cause i think i was 'cause i was trying some stuff uh a couple weeks ago uh so that may be mine 
um 
oh really 
okay 
oh yeah 
okay okay 
yeah 'cause i saw it again today and i was just won was that me 
yeah i think that was me i think so 
um but yeah i'll yeah that was that was and sure 
no 
give you false impressions of what's hap s something's going on 
yeah i know it 
tons tons 
all those objects yeah 
right 
how's our quota on that 
what's what do actually do you know how much we have 
yeah okay 
so we probably won't have to worry about that 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah exac exactly 
um i don't know 
how's everything else going 
oh yeah 
actually 
do we wanna keep that 
like are we keeping that how that happens 
it just prints everything out in the in the shell as well like as it does everything it just kinda i guess that's its default behaviour anyway 
so it's just kinda doesn't really do anything 
so okay 
oh right 
yeah 
'kay 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
i was more or less just playing with the things that had to do directly with what i was doing 
so i didn't didn't take it for a full test drive yet 
but uh i can do that 
that's well right after this yeah 
a lot of this java stuff isn't though 
mm-hmm 
if you if you ch if you change your window manager it might look a little bit nicer 
just yeah 
oh yeah 
okay right 
yeah 
yeah 
actually can we run it on windows 
oh yeah 
okay 
were you using like a gui builder or just all from code 
okay and that's 
that's nasty 
oh yeah 
wow 
okay 
hmm 
well well can you can you connect to your home machine from here and then start it from there 
just yeah 
i don't know 
i've done stuff like that before it's insane it's insane 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
right 
what was it 
well it's kinda boring yeah 
exactly 
hmm 
right 
oh yeah cool 
okay right 
or i don't know if we have like uh a choice so they can filter those out f the the top most common 
just say okay all show all or show you know only the im interesting ones 
yeah 
yeah 
i don't know yeah it doesn't really matter 
well if we just automatically filter these out 
they're boring 
mm 
right 
yeah 
okay 
actually yeah 
this is good for browsing though 
it's perfect 
i mean that's sorta exactly what you wanna do and look at these things 
and so yeah who's doing what 
exactly 
it's fun 
right 
yeah 
let's take 'em to the next joke 
yeah 
hmm 
right okay 
yeah 
well it's not a real joke anyways 
yeah 
okay that sounds real so that's sort of implemented now or is that or is it close 
wow 
super 
okay 
like to test that 
mm 
actually 
yeah 
and when i update my n. l. just uh recompile the m. browsers and then just uh get that 
yeah 
well so it'll use as my part as well my um the m. search 
it w actually do we have like naming convention for s our sorts files 
just prefix 'em with an m. and or 
yeah 
yeah 
well that's sorta what i was doing 
it like for your stuff do you have no 
oh okay alright 
it doesn't really ma no it doesn't matter at this point 
no i was just kinda curious 
i'm thinking about future stuff maybe if 
yeah that's true too 
yeah yeah doesn't matter 
yeah exactly 
'cause 
yeah 
okay 
oh yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
mm yeah right 
yeah i know yeah 
same here 
oh right 
super size meeting browser 
well it's 
i don't know 
um 
just probably basic just text font and just something nice something solid maybe 
be a good 
yeah exactly 
i know 
anybody have any um artistic talent 
no 
no 
ok 
yeah 
oh it's possib some people are balanced 
some people are no i know some balanced people 
no 
maybe i'll check see if i can find anyone 
um 
okay 
how do you s add that to the to the java programme 
is it just basic little okay 
uh-huh yeah 
oh 
so just in the main frame 
okay 
okay right 
right okay 
oh so it'll do the automatic scrunching down if it's bigger 
oh cool 
nice 
super 
they know it's a distincting di distinctive experience i guess 
yeah 
can we g 
can we get sound on these machines 
yeah 
i wish actually have you ever managed n oh yeah you must have yeah got play any sort of music on the dice machines 
right okay 
oh right right 
they have them on the front too i think 
yeah 
mm 
okay right 
right 
yes 
yeah 
get a lot of audio 
no 
okay 
um okay well this this looks good 
yeah 
are we gonna be uh trying to get the output from that and i don't know still haven't found out if it's um 
feasible to open up more than one well 
as many mm nom objects as we can for each meeting to do like we were gonna need like figure that the ranking did make sense 
like to be looking through the highest ranked ones first 
so if we are gonna look through only five of them 
just pick the top five to to do the the search and since that's probably what we're looking for anyways 
so 
yeah 
are you serious 
maybe i'll try 
yeah 
okay 
s yeah i'd that'd be a surprise 'cause i'm bad at java 
yes 
um 
yeah seriously 
mm yeah 
practical java 
yeah 
how do you guys find the documentation for n. x. t. and 
yeah okay good 
that's my belief as well 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
well it's still i guess research platform 
uh 
yeah 
yeah that's true 
okay 
i was just curious 
well 
so c did we have a date for when we actually want the system done 
i thought i thought we said th i thought we ch yeah i thought we change it to the tenth or something 
um 'cause the thing is i mean we can keep working on little things f you know and sh oh well we should do this or do this 
should we um 
so i don't know do we want to set an actual hard deadline for like did when exactly were we gonna start the evaluation 
mm 'kay 
well we yeah i guess well we can still come up with like test cases or whatever for for the people and just yeah 
come up with scenarios that sort of thing 
i mean that's that's fairly straight forward 
and could actually be fun 
yeah exactly 
that's true just brain storm yeah 
yeah 
yeah that's true yeah 
yeah 
right 
to work on it as well 
yeah 
no i've i've got my d. n. l. g. presentation on monday 
i have to read the paper 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah i think so 
we'll probably have to talk to steve at some point as well i guess 
but um 
i'll probably just have a regular tuesday meeting with him 
like we can send him an email but i don't know if he's around even 
he's not around this week is he or that's why i think that's why we didn't have the the meeting 
yeah 'kay 
yeah it's true 
although do we really want the answer 
s s so if we don't ask we can push it off and 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah that's 
you're right yeah 
we're looking for volunteers 
yeah 
yeah if they have time 
it's hard finding people 
yeah yeah i know but 
yeah 
yeah that's true 
yeah that's true 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
actually some other friends of mine in different programmes might might be more willing 
have more of a break 
so that might be an idea get a range of types of people as well 
like not like highly computer lit like not you know linux literate or yeah 
i think that might be good as well 
set a wider range of people 
uh no i think like three or four maybe 
bet that would be a good yeah i think that d no that's that's a lot 
no 
yeah exactly 
like the thing like did an h. c. i. course a while ago and it's just that's what these yeah there's three people 
yeah 
and that was fine 
then you can do a massive amount of analysis on three people 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
s we don't want to 
yeah exact exact mm visible minorities 
yeah 
three or four 
oh god 
um but yeah if he finds them then that's cool 
if he finds the people 
m um 
oh writing up 
looks brilliant 
okay 
um i thought the evaluation maybe for the report 
so th and that's due on the twenty fifth 
twenty fifth is is it 
i is it 
that's what i understood 
i thought it said twen i thought he said twenty fifth 
even though it's good friday i thought okay 
yeah 
oh yeah 
easter two days yeah 
no 
well it wasn't originally either 
so um yeah okay 
okay 
so that gives us two days to do the uh evaluation 
no evaluation i was gonna say 
and report 
i didn't think so necessarily 
i wouldn't i wouldn't assume 
but we should ask him 
yeah that's probably c like it's a good target 
it's a good yeah 
mm right 
yeah 
actually it's fun no 
no it's it just funny that you know have it finish by monday 
'cause after monday i'm pretty much free for about a week or so 
it's like it's like if we had you know a bit more time 
yeah 
okay 
oh the next one okay 
see i'm yeah i'm free this after this monday and it's well why 
what else uh that's that's easy compared to the other stuff 
i mean i'm not even worried about that 
yeah 
yeah okay 
yeah okay 
oh 
you didn't know that 
oh yeah 
how's yours 
thank god 
okay 
maybe that was us then not him 
no actually i might have this stuff here 
schedule 
yeah thursday twenty fourth 
deadline for submission of final report 
oh 
well now you can 
yeah 
so twenty fourth so it we sh 
yep 
um just to ask whether we need to have the evaluation done for the demonstration 
or 
we should have it done anyways 
but okay yeah 
sure 
hopefully but yeah 
is is that is that a part of the demonstration did they want that information the evaluation as part of yep 
right 
oh right 
um there are a f a few little things 
um just made some comments the last meeting 
just general like how it all integrates blah blah blah all this kind of stuff 
but yeah 
no 
i'd expect somewhere ten to fifteen pages 
although it's fifty percent of the mark i think is it 
i think 
yeah 
exactly 
well we have a bit of time to do the writing up 
so that'll be good 
yeah 
just a fine tuned or detailed and yeah 
more stuff 
yeah that could be yeah that could easily be five or six pages 
okay 
sure 
oh yeah sure 
yeah no no big rush 
although just to get it out of the way 
so i'll try and remember to do that to my own s 
yeah 
yeah 
yep 
just basic um pretty much like the interim do you wanna do you have the interim stuff 
just um sorta like google type thing and just um oh 
yeah 
yeah 
then as these come up it'll just pop 'em in there 
it doesn't do anything yet 
s like that's that's the other big part 
i mean how to get that that communication between the two different kinds of windows 
because the thing is if we have different things in here like transcripts versus summaries versus topics 
um that was why it was sorta deciding to get the three panes in there instead of just the one 
um 
yeah so so there's a couple of those little things as we yeah exact it's beautiful 
yeah m m. makes more sense 
okay 
is that how it works in the other ones 
in like the other windows like the various like um if we're in the topic 
or 
if you have like a particular w window that you want me to mimic its behaviour 
then like just find it in the programme and just say okay just how this one does it 
so if it's like the topic window or the whatever 
so then i can just sorta trace back and figure out what objects they are and bring 'em into here 
so 
hmm 
okay 
okay 
right 
okay 
so one left click just highlights is that 
oh just the item in 
the transcript or whatever it is 
the 
if even if we could just 
yeah 
that should be possible 
right 
oh yeah 
although yeah this this will uh this is actually different from how we print it up here 
like if we're doing a global search 
then we are gonna do it like how we said before and pop up a list of the various meetings that found those terms 
and then we'll either you know multi select or you know 
choose the one we wanna actually do this wi i think multi select would make the most sense 
well just um if there's like three of the top meetings like like we said before 
language we're looking for the l word language and get the highest rated ones 
to actually look for the terms we're not loading it on a val of seventy six i mean or seventy five whatever it is 
um so the r the results from that will you know narrow down what we're gonna use for the local search 
then we'll just do the local search on those ones that are chosen 
and if we can yeah 
so it it will be a bit different from from how that is right now when when we do the global search at least 
yep 
yes yes 
exactly yep 
okay 
hmm 
um so that we search two different 
right 
yeah 
that's actually fairly 
you know local anyways yeah 
no that's easy 
sure yep 
that's that's quite t straight forward 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
exactly 
well it it kinda makes sense 
it would be kinda cool 
actually are we bothering with our topic stuff still 
or is that sorta gone like our own topic segment 
like since we can't do the labelling and all the rest 
we are still doing our topic segment 
well you are you are i guess 
okay 
but we're not gonna be we won't be l doing a global search on the topics for our topics since they don't have labels 
probably 
okay 
la label all the label ones i'll open 'em 
yeah all the label twos yeah 
i don't know 
okay 
yeah okay 
yeah okay 
well no it will be kind of straight forward 
like if you're creating if you're creating x. m. l. files of this 
yeah 
hmm 
hmm 
yeah 
yep 
right 
mm 
mm-hmm 
hmm 
probably not 
i mean just get work done 
i think that's what i've gotta do 
yeah 
hmm-hmm hmm 
yeah 
okay 
yep yep 
okay 
tu tu tu tu 
hi good morning 
oops 
oh sorry 
mm-hmm 
yeah me 
cat 
where did this come from 
uh yep 
thank you 
uh maybe you can guess what i'm trying to make 
yep 
it's actually sitting so it's sitting it's not standing 
okay i see it as one thing it's very supportive 
it's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog it can be your best friend 
it doesn't discriminate between you based on what you are 
second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition 
dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a dog 
thank you 
okay 
sorry 
does it look like a dog actually 
mm 
eagle okay 
one point four or something like that 
one point four euro would make a pound or something like that 
yeah 
okay pretty huge margin 
so then 
mm-hmm 
yeah that c 
okay you wanna integrate everything into one like 
okay 
so simplification of symbols you could think of 
mm-hmm 
menu alright 
uh uh 
right i was thinking on the same lines you instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user 
may h maybe have an l. c. d. di display or something like that like a mobile yeah and with menus 
and if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe 
you mean to save it lesser number 
right 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm okay 
s 
it might it might save a b bit of space it's i instead of looking bulky it might look small 
but it might have its cost implications 
right 
okay 
mm yeah 
are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better 
okay that's fine 
am i supposed to be standing up there 
okay 
yeah i've got 
yes 
okay 
hello everybody 
um i'm sarah the project manager and this is our first meeting surprisingly enough 
okay this is our agenda um 
we will do some stuff get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other 
um then we'll go do tool training talk about the project plan 
discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that as far as i can understand 
now we're developing a remote control which you probably already know 
um we want it to be original something that's uh people haven't thought of 
that's not out in the shops um trendy appealing to a wide market 
but you know not a hunk of metal and user friendly grannies to kids maybe even pooches should be able to use it 
okay um first is the functional design um this is where we all go off and do our individual work 
um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that 
um conceptual design 
what we're thinking how it's gonna go and then the detailed design how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work 
okay right 
we're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board i'll go first and um sum up the characteristics of that animal 
so 
okay i'll leave space for everyone else 
um 
what's missing 
we're running out of blue 
okay 
i'm not gonna ask you to guess i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger 
and i see them as majestic 
and independent 
and 
proud 
now who would like to go next 
'kay 
is that your lapel then 
there you go 
okay thank you 
okay 
well as you can see the quality of the work today is um 
gonna be a bird 
is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird 
that's lovely 
okay it's fine 
technical help 
hmm 
okay yeah 
a seagu right not a seagull 
eagle 
mm-hmm 
that's lovely 
okay 
that was fun right 
um finance wise we've got a selling price at twenty five euros which i don't actually know what that is in pounds at all 
any ideas 
d fifteen 
seventeen 
okay that's expensive 
i think so i think so i'll be able to um pull it up or i could put it in the shared folder or something 
really 
mm 
i think 
yeah um production cost's at twelve fifty so 
half of the selling price is taken up by building it 
um and profit aim is fifty million euros which is uh 
yi yes um yeah i presume so 
um 
mm-hmm 
no yeah 
so yes yes i don't think we have to i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that 
um making that a key point just that it's going to be in the international market like australia america things like that 
okay 
what are your experiences with remote controls 
i mean i've got we got um we had three videos 
a t. v. and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls 
um that you programme each of your things into but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re programme it every now and again 
i think it was quite a cheapie as well so that might have had something to do with it 
but that was quite good the fact that you could 
you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you 
mm 
yeah the main that's the main stuff anyway 
i mean and you don't want to i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that 
yeah 
um 
when they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording 
things like that inside it 
'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at it's obvious what you're doing um 
what about the older generation 
what about granny and grandads 
um my grandad can answer his mobile phone but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that 
i don't think they tape things i don't think they use 
mm yeah the age gap 
mm 
i don't know i d i don't like the you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows based running system 
i find it really confusing i kept getting lost in the phone 
i di i've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost 
but 
that's just me 
yeah 
teletext has got that option as well 
yeah 
or what about kind of a dual function 
in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play volume programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures 
obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that 
mm-hmm 
i think that's a cost thing i don't i don't know how much we're gonna know about 
yes no that's important 
okay 
mm 
yeah 
um right okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things 
um 
i think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation 
sure 
okay 
mm 
i would it would probably 
i mean there's sky remote controls and everything 
they're kind of moulded and look a bit different and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic 
which looks a bit smarter so yeah i guess that's stuff we can think about 
okay so let's break it up there 
okay 
so see you in half an hour 
i think so yeah 
it's sitting down 
yeah i'll have a go 
thanks 
alright okay 
well since you guys have chosen the ones i wanted to do i'll have to have to go for something a bit random 
and also my drawing skill isn't that great so yeah 
okay now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now so 
yeah it can be a crocodile it can be a crocodile 
well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a t. rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually 
yeah and uh i'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is 
um 
uh scary 
uh strong 
yeah that's about it i think 
uh uh 
wo 
hmm 
okay 
uh 
s 
uh 
okay some sort of bird 
ah eagle right okay 
they're good at golf 
yeah no yeah an eagle 
it's about mm mm yeah 
yeah yeah something like that so that yeah about seventeen seventeen pounds something like that 
but 
havi having said that though if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway 
so it'd still be yeah we had to buy one 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah uh 
use all the ones at the same time 
yeah 'cause you 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext so 
yeah 
yeah what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self intuitive and you can can work out 
what everything's doing 'cause i mean 
menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do 
but i don't know how 
oh yeah 
yeah i don't i don't know how for twenty fi or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get 
you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l. c. d. thing anyway i'd assume 
y 
yeah 
no uh uh 
yeah 
just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable 
the sort of i i had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics 
so i think think the whole design thing might be qui i mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
so we've got both of these clipped on 
she gonna answer me or not 
right both of them okay 
god 
jesus it's gonna fall off 
a kind of dog 
sorry 
uh 
mm-hmm 
please please leave me a space at the bottom i'm little you can get to the top with standing on a chair 
i think it's outstandingly good 
crocodile 
o 
beauti that's 
okay 
um i'm very impressed with your artistic skills mine's are dreadful 
oops this is now coming apart let me just put the top in 
i hope that clicks in i'll just i'll hold it on okay 
oops oh dear what happened there 
hopefully that'll stay on two handed version 
okay uh 
again this is off the top of my head i was gonna do a big cat too um 
oh dear it doesn't look what like what i want it to be 
uh 
it's not a vampire bat honestly 
uh and somewhere there's a body behind 
that's my dreadful that's the worst yet 
that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull i never thought of a seagull 
an eagle um again i'm thinking on my feet goodness 
i suppose they're all so independent i'd put that one down again 
da dum um 
indepen independent right did you say they're good at golf 
are they 
oh 
oh right okay i'm not good at golf 
i'd say they're quite free spirited flying around everywhere doing their own thing 
and uh birds of prey aren't they oh dear intrepid 
i'll put that intrepid 
there we go hope that pen's gonna be okay 
whoops 
seventeen 
seventeen pounds 
should we be making notes of this 
we can just refer to this later can't we 
yeah okay 
okay 
right 
so 
so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie cheapie option 
mm 
mm-hmm 
in our first year 
mm-hmm 
you've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market 
any particular thing it's everyone user friendly to everyone 
okay 
big target group 
no 
mm 
alright 
mm-hmm 
right 
mm-hmm 
my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy 
not doing any tampering with it and programming using it to programme t. v. and uh uh videos and things 
but basically on off volume up and down channel one two th that basic functions 
i don't think i could go any further with it than that so i suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm 
and symbols that you don't necessarily understand symbols you're meant to understand that you don't 
oh yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
actually that just raises a point i wonder what our design people think 
but you know on a mobile phone you can press a key and it gives you a menu 
it's got a menu display i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful so you've got a little l. c. d. display 
with menus yeah yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too 
right 
right 
so that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with 
that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps and that's another issue how we tackle that 
mm-hmm 
right 
mm-hmm 
is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books 
obviously it displays less on the screen it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
the other thing is just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again 
it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top 
your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah like smaller 
and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone it can still be lightweight plastic you know 
something that's easily moulded and produced 
sorry i'm treading on your territory guys 
ah right 
okay 
sure b y yeah 
but yeah i mean it doesn't have to be that 
you know th that was my main point we don't have to use metal 
i don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper i presume it would 
yeah yeah yeah 
right 
okay 
'kay 
do we go back to our room 
yep 
mm-hmm 
sorry 
yep 
okay 
yep 
'kay 
it can be okay that's okay with me 
further 
oops 
why's it not working 
f. eight right 
okay 
mm why's it in the right 
yeah it's connecting 
okay 
yeah 
actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting 
just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because 
um i haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable 
so purpose as william already said i would put it to simplify the interaction with t. v. to make make it as simple as possible 
and to summarise i i would say it's it should be user friendly by being easy to use 
rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features 
like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever 
but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it will this two features together 
so what the concept is to have a flip top model 
the main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever 
can be put in the middle part of the f flip top 
so it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people 
findings most people prefer us user friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user 
as we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said 
yeah with that i think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly 
um 
that's so this is if you ask me personally i would make uh 
flip top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that 
so in overall a simple and uh 
user friendly design 
uh any comments like if you want 
okay 
i think you'll have to 
you can't 
it'll have to this can't be pulled 
you'll have to push it a bit more 
yep 
yeah this is more than enough 
okay 
yeah i think you can pull it out now 
yeah 
'kay 
that's fine 
okay 
mm-hmm 
anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that 
ten perc 
mm-hmm 
okay 
pens 
mm-hmm 
okay 
so are we talking of a single model or maybe five six designs 
sure 
alright 
right 
the features could be same and the body could look slightly different 
so 
yeah 
yeah uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use 
the injuries maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that 
so a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups 
you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also the market 
maybe for u. s. and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small yeah 
mm-hmm 
we could focus on the biggest market 
if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
right 
i think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street 
but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that 
simple 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote 
mm-hmm 
right 
mm-hmm 
okay 
what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back 
basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box like a chocolate 
that's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up so they came up with something like this curled up so here 
and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much 
so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing curled up like a boat 
g uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like 
so it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your 
the way you h hold of it's kind of semi circular in the bottom something like that 
i wouldn't say exactly semi circular but yeah smooth 
current 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
we could look in at that but 
mm 
what we were talking is to make it more 
rather than like sea shells logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model 
rather than you know trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like 
a sea shell 
yeah we could look in at that 
yeah maybe we could come at some say five 
six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like that could be the most common design 
but we can like think of five six designs 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
for detection right 
yep i think 
true 
oops 
we should f 
i think it's time for us to 
get back to 
help 
it's up there 
that screen's black 
alright okay 
okay that's fine 
are we done 
right okay um this is our second meeting and i might be a bit all over the place 
um right our agenda for today do you want us to give you a second 
okay um 
i'll go over what we decided last meeting 
um 
we decided upon a universal control one handset for all t. v. video 
equipment 
um that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers wide age range not limiting anyone 
we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product we put fashion in electronics you know that kind of s thing 
um our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget um that we might 
have a bit of oh oh you can see it okay 
um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like 
um 
want it to look uncluttered undaunting to the customer 
we discussed a flip open design um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming things like that 
okay 
um three presentations i've got written here so 
shall we hear from marketing first 
no that's fine that's fine 
unplug me 
um f. n. 
function f. eight 
mm-hmm 
they are 
okay thank you very much 
um would you like to continue on from that 
or maybe move the laptop over 
f. function 
oh there 
'kay 
um i think we'll chat about it at the end 
okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end um 
ooh it's vibrating that's strange 
oh god 
right okay 
we just do the best we can 
yeah you might 
ah 
look at that 
okay 
yeah 
right um 
we have new project requirements um 
we're not going to be using teletext um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now 
um 
our control is only going to be for t. v. it's not going to be a combined control 
which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer 
it says for t. v. only so looks like it's just yeah i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it but 
i don't know what do you think 
it just said for t. v. only 
but i mean general t. v. controls do do video as well 
i mean you bu well som you get com you get combined t. v. and videos don't you 
mm 
i think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming 
mm 
hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah bu 
we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves 
so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something i it needs to be the thing that you 
use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose you were saying whistling 
maybe on the t. v. you could put like a pack on the t. v. or something so you can't see the remote 
you go and press the button on top of the t. v. and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there 
something like that but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me 
um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset 
um so we want logo we want um 
fashionable trendy i mean what you were talking about with the marketing 
um people paying more for it to look good 
um we need to focus on that as well 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
what about you were talking about the buttons um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big 
rubber buttons not tiny little one big rubber buttons but what about i mean 'cause we got to make it original 
what about 
um you know with the touch screen computers 
yeah 
um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either not sure about the 
you don't have to press it you just have to put your thumb onto it 
um think that might appeal i'm thinking kind of japan i'm thinking uh young um office people trendy kind of a thing 
um but quite um 
easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations um 
were too big 
mm 
i think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller 
or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly um 
it's gonna be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities um 
or a speech recognition which is extremely expensive i think that's the only way that you kind of avoid 
that kind of issue 
we are we're talking about um 
the type of company that we're working for as well 
that they want um it to be fashionable they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations 
now with the baby boomers the older generations are actually larger they have a greater population than us young people 
but i don't think we're focusing on that i think we are focusing on a sort of mid range um 
business kind of class type people 
mm-hmm 
okay so the remote control functions 
um we've got the t. v. we've got the video now there's um 
i can't remember what it's called the little code at the end of programme details yes 
we could use that as an alternative to programming in times things like that is that i always found that really easy when i discovered it um 
because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on 
that's fine but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to 
you put the number in and it's just a number it's not a date it's not a time 
it's not a channel it's not when it finishes it's not anything like that it's just a number 
no 
you've already got the numbers for typing in anyway 
it is after um if you look in the newspaper t. v. guide or any t. v. guide there's a five 
six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times 
um and it has been around for quite a long time 
no it's not um but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that 
mm 
okay so 
mm-hmm 
the functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there you're pressing this button and your t. v. 's not doing it 
taking your t. v. and your control and saying look this is what i'm doing it's not working what should i do 
i think so 
um 
instruction manuals 
but i mean they're there's customer service 
there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge 
there's no extra t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street um 
mm 
but we should focus on making the manual as user friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages 
it does you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it 
so that should be something we think about 
um what other functions 
we need i'm not sure if we need a design um decision now 
but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries that's what i was thinking about 
mobile phone batteries what kinda battery is that 
well they la they they last quite a long time and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones 
you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something 
but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged 
um something like that should reduce the size of it 
yeah it could be on that yeah okay 
s 
yes 
rechargeable with a docking station 
so the rechargeable which would be your 
field 
okay 
yes which it is cheaper in the long run as well 
um th the shape you got trendy 
i don't wanna big box with lots of things you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either 
because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple um 
they do 
okay so we've got a flip screen 
um 
okay 
'cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway 
okay 
can you look into the company logo 
um things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product 
i mean 
for example if it was a c. or something like that you could have it in a vague c. shape that opens up kind of like a shell 
or something um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite 
um obviously into the design while also making it quite different from anything else that's there 
well we need to think about how it's gonna look different 
or you could do um different like you get with mobile phones different fascias 
you could have different kind of casings 
so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and 
yeah 
mm 
okay 
okay 
okay 
right i think we have to round it up um 
sure 
that was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions 
making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date 
it's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel things like that 
um it could be it c 
it yes it could be uh adv advertisement feature um rather than design feature you know drawing attention to that 
and it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful 
yeah 
um 
we've got the buttons but i think we'll work through that with the design of it um 
yes 
yes 
and we've talked about um there being an alarm or something a beeping for being lost um 
learning how to use it should be as simple as possible 
but there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the i the instruction manual 
i don't know if we deal with that um 
i think 
yep and different from what's out there 
yep i think that's us 
i think you might get guidance but um 
i th 
instruction manuals 'cause there tends to be a 
demonised thing u um they're everyone's got like a big pile of them but no one really uses them 
um 
yes right 
okay 
right okay 
i think you can email me if there's any more questions 
um and i'll be able to not answer them 
okay yeah i'll go first 
can i grab the 
thanks 
what do i have to press 
oh f. eight 
oh right yeah 
okay 
maybe 
yep there we go 
okay this is uh the working design presented by me the uh industrial designer extraordinaire 
'kay this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so 
what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design 
well a device which basically just sends the signal to the t. v. to change its state 
whether that be the power or the channel um or the volume 
everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t. v. or other appliance that it's sending the signal to 
um so i decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that 
but uh although we will want to be taking 
ideas from other people we wanna make sure that our design stands out and i thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because 
i'm dealing with the inside really 
so um yeah i ran out of time so i couldn't do this one as fun as the last one 
um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t. v. presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use 
wireless and you don't need to send very much information 
um most of them are powered by some form of battery 
now our one 
i'm i'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple a. batteries but those can be quite bulky so i d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control 
yeah sure 
um no no 
if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries 
they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in 
yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but i'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across 
um and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round 
um now the ones at the moment are small but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller 
now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work 
uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose 
we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information 
now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the t. v. unless they're in a cinema 
which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine 
and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer 
and so this is what i had as the basic idea of what we wanna do 
it's not a proper circuit i'm not sure if it'd work or not 
i'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway 
we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh u. i. interface um 
which would basically 
when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of i. r. data which could be decoded by the t. v. receiver 
which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever 
um whatever form of communication that the t. v. s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all t. v. s use at the moment 
and then finally 
um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that i've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good 
um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base 
we were talking about it before and also just something that i was thinking about 
uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have 
i th that was just sort of a general point there 
and that's uh yeah 
alright okay and yeah that's that's what i came up with there so if you wanna 
ooh 
function f. eight yeah 
no no yeah it's just 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah sure 
there we go i've got a bit more of the cable 
there we go 
uh you should be able to and yeah there you go 
okay 
huh 
t yeah yeah 
i d well i dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g 
yeah 
if yeah and if you got if you got a sky box they have one of those plus boxes 
you can record straight off the t. v. anyway so on to on to like the t. v. hard drive or so 
yeah 
yeah 
ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway 
alright okay 
alright okay 
yeah 
yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so i thought that could be quite a 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs i mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same 
just yeah yeah 
'kay 
yeah yeah that's what i was just yeah 
no well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
but also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs 
ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the x. box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um 
they're c uh just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you i don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
huh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah 
yeah speech recognition but yeah 
mm 
ge uh 
yeah 
video plus 
yeah yeah 
just whack in the number 
and you w yeah 
and you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that 
you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway yeah 
it's not 
yeah 
it's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things 
mm 
though if y if you've got something like sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series 
so that yeah 
but just to have that function would be would be really good 
yeah 
mm 
but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also i mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but i i'm not sure how much the cost would be of having 
yeah i mean 
i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that 
yeah 
department yeah 
yeah 
and they're yeah they should be f yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
it's the uh yeah 
um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones 
but they come with a charger i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh 
yeah on that as well so 
yeah some sort of docking station or yeah 
yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
oh god 
uh no that's okay sorry 
um is it okay if i postpone that til later i just want to get access to a little bit more information is that okay 
mm-hmm 
could i can i interject to ask a question there is that appropriate 
you're saying the triple a. batteries are small or the surrounding it 
mm-hmm 
right the triple a. s are the smallest you can get are they not right 
oh i see 
okay 
mm 
mm 
mm 
that's a very important part it came up in our market research findings too so i can refer to that whenever you like me to present 
no 
the plug hasn't come out at the bottom has it 
no 
meter adjusting 
mm 
'kay 
have i got to keep this here 
does it matter 
i'll have t i'll have to move it won't i 
uh whoops 
will it manage 
bit more oh dear 
oh 
is that okay 
thank you just pull it closer a little bit 
get it right over okay thank you 
okay um i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research 
um so that's where we started we used our our usability lab 
the company's usability lab we did our usual selection methods to get a cross section of the general public 
male and female all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab 
just their general use of the remote control you can see we had a hundred subjects there 
our findings lots of findings i've just summarised some of them here 
the overall thing which i've i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls 
so it has obvious design implications there 
um we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly 
eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy we were quite surprised by that finding 
but um that's quite a high proportion of our our you know international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking 
um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall 
for example you can see below there seventy five percent of users zap a lot so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel hopping 
so again there's power implications there 
um fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons so again a big design issue there 
um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control 
um 
the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier uh remote controls are often lost in the room 
it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that 
uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons 
they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions 
um um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury 
you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems 
um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition 
again that was to aid i think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control some kind of speech recognition 
something we didn't put to them 
but which i'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light 
possibly 
um that trend reverses in the older age groups 
so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features 
that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses they're not so bothered with this 
i had marvellous tables and things that i could show you but i think i'll just keep it simple 
if there's any more information i can email you extra details is that okay 
mm-hmm so can we not programme a video with this remote control 
just channel hopping 
would that imply video use 
mm-hmm yes 
yes 
um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons 
i think th th those do tend to be the basic channel hopping things and on and off for the video fast forwarding 
so on and i think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare 
so i don't know if that's something we need to look at 
mm-hmm 
in fact i've just called up that table there we asked those two questions the table relates to both questions so we didn't differentiate 
would you prefer an l. c. d. screen that's multi function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control 
so you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there 
and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group i think that's just general fear of new technology 
oh yeah 
right 
mm 
yes 
that's a super idea 
yeah 
yes further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is 
it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market 
what is um attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african i dunno you get the idea 
it's it's gonna vary around the world 
at the end of the day th the engineering design is one thing 
it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world 
yeah 
mm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
yes it will appeal to sections of the market def 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm mm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same yes absolutely 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
i'm concerned when you read the the r. s. i. issue again repetitive strain injury 
i don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough 
i think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that 
um r. s. i. tends to be caused by repetitive small movements 
i'm j i really can't get my head round this one this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about 
mm 
i know and it becomes ridiculous yes i know 
yeah 
yes 
mm-hmm 
do we have to initially um you know looking at the findings here focus on 
a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later 
do we really have to go for everyone right away 
um 
mm 
and when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people young people trendy people 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm 
i'm just thinking of budgetary issues too for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage 
we want to you know not waste money not be profligate and uh 
you know focus on where the idea will be taken up 
first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this 
mm 
right i've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful 
ah hmm 
right 
superb 
mm 
yes 
right 
excellent mm-hmm 
mm 
right 
can i just run this past you while it occurs to me i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another 
but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me to produce our own mobile phones 
that that's kind of what led us on to comparing t. v. remote controls with with their design features um chain companies like carphone warehouse 
you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it 
they'll phone the company you can use their telephones 
is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this 
if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets th you know which button is it i press for this 
th as free as a free aspect of our service would that not make it more attractive to them 
mm 
mm-hmm 
right 
alright 
yes 
if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel 
but i mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for t. v. and video 
we're not gonna put any okay just a thought 
okay 
mm-hmm 
sure 
mm 
yeah 
not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that yes okay 
mm 
puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious yes 
sure okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
and we don't w i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical these long 
brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface 
we definitely an ob an obvious thing a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles we don't want that 
mm-hmm 
slightly curved curved 
mm 
mm 
i mean look at the mobile 
i think that's that sounds a really attractive idea 
i've not come across anything like that before if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip top 
then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic 
nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers 
that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think 
i think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic 
you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
less chance of it being lost too 
it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either 
it's easier to bit nice to handle 
mm-hmm 
okay 
can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that i haven't missed anything 
so it's no teletext it's only for t. v. and by implication video our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control um something about videoplus 
right 
right 
right so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l. c. d. a reminder about using videoplus 
so that they have a look at the guide and 
or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements is this just that was an add on feature 
uh-huh 
right 
right so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature 
right 
mm and the rechargeable batteries 
was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements 
mm-hmm 
that's not at the moment a requirement it's something we're looking at 
what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like 
okay 
what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting 
or shall i just sort of generally look at all the issues involved 
okay 
okay 
whoops questionnaire four 
'cause we're at lunchtime now i think 
oops 
mm 
after lunch 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
'kay 
yep 
'kay 
fine 
it's okay with me 
yep 
regarding those sizes which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also 
so maybe a standard triple a. might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space 
uh 
right 
night 
and are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery it like it runs for long time 
mm-hmm 
okay 
we c 
solar would be slightly expensives 
it's twelve point f 
another question is like sorry 
w w which one would last the longest because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day 
a remote control like so we have to s look at the life also 
okay 
so 
mm-hmm 
okay 
second thing is yeah and second question is like a mobile you can change the cover you call it a skin or whatever 
so in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green parrot green to chilli red or something like that 
so is that feature available in like uh titanium or it's like only specific to plastic or 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
something like 
alright 
that could be a good idea 
it could it would be comfortable to hold on also 
sorry i didn't get the last part you're talking of 
just what you said i i didn't get the uh meaning of it completely you're saying like 
uh-huh 
okay 
'kay 
absolutely f for somebody who very often 
if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch pad very fast compared to a button like 
if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever 
and just one small question before like you are regarding the circuit since we are hav having a flip top 
we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing 
so we can divide the circuit like you know 
mm-hmm 
okay 
okay 
okay uh 
would like to share something which i did here 
first thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting 
especially from the marketing and industrial design to check on the customer needs and feasibility 
second is we checked into competitors the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here 
so y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh people need trendy they are bored of black and white 
so you generally see rectangular shape very monotonous kind of designs here 
and uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here 
no particular remote is standard 
like some some people have a 
here you see this 
this is on a i i 
i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control 
rest other buttons they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all 
okay and second as already discussed with william 
we are going to have m maybe a g. g. u. i. interface in the f in the middle of the flip top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer 
have icons or touch pad or whatever which is 
like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of g. u. i. graphic user interface 
so basically not point or click 
press any particular device he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify 
and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device that means the use of button 
so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer 
so we are having a combination of boards so f on the s simpler board 
on the top we have this button rubber buttons to keep frequently changing the channels 
but 
mm-hmm 
okay and you mean to the 
and the lower distance 
oh f perfect 
so the findings are too many cluttered buttons 
repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained example the volume and channel control buttons 
all are confusing and in inconsistent 
okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition there was a mail 
which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature 
we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost 
but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it 
so it could be like where is the remote and the remote answers i am here 
some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also 
and technologically innovative also 
so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this 
my personal preferences would be like as already uh marketing department 
they want something to do with fruit so i wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit 
but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours like the vibrant colours uh red chilli uh 
tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have like for example i if you see the previous slide uh 
i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern here 
so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls 
this is central one the one you yeah volume and channel 
so keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models if you look at all the models it's here 
this 
and 
voice recognition 
the kinetic 
mm-hmm 
maybe we could start with the black and white 
that that way we could upgrade later 
mm 
yeah 
and for the sorry 
for the body design i think plastic uh w yeah we could use the body 
for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip something like to add to the design 
plast right 
it's 
uh i it's different 
right 
acupressure you could talk of acupressures 
and finally the body should be retouchable may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside 
it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time 
okay 
the rubber 
fine 
yeah 
fine uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost 
so are we looking at voice 
or maybe like uh william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains 
for l yeah the whistle 
so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle 
yep 
uh sorry i didn't mention this but we'll be incorporating in the design 
fine 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
again a questionnaire huh 
i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now 
i'll wait until you're all um hooked up 
okay 
put it on in that way 
thanks 
okay 
welcome back everybody hope you've had fun 
right um this is our conceptual design meeting um i think we're slightly ahead of ourselves 
from the last meeting i th i i think yeah um 
this is where we talk about um properties materials user interface and trend watching 
so i think we've touched on a few things 
to do with that already but we'll just go over it 
um 
the minutes from the last time 
um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext 
it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow 
um 
we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal 
we were thinking a shell but something along those lines just a different shape from what's normal um 
you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries 
and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost things like that 
um and our market was going to be young business kind of range 
okay so shall we start with the first presentation 
yes if you feel 
it's okay 
yeah 
okay thank you very much 
um 
let's start from the inside and work our way out 
i don't think so not yet 
um yes thank you 
i hate those little things 
especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them 
okay 
'kay 
'kay 
wa can you explain that 
like a right okay 
how what kind of how l long can you get out of that 
i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night 
or 
that doesn't count though does it 
i thought it was u. v. like 
any any 
i'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun 
uh i don't think it counts electric lights no but i mean not many you don't want to limit your market 
i mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people but there are people 
mm but then it would be charging through the day 
i think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening 
okay 
yeah i've seen 
but then if you think about a watch it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around 
you're doing things it is moving a lot of the time 
if you'd i mean you switch the t. v. on then you put it on the side 
then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side 
is it really gonna be enough 
okay 
so it's not the draw on it isn't 
okay 
like a dual kind of 
expensive as well 
what kind of price are we looking at for i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest 
solar 
well they're not designed 
practical wise okay 
you do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well 
mm 
okay can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature 
can we think about that 
'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's 
well add it in to think about um 
because 
where am i 
if it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less 
you you wouldn't lose it so much 
but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than 
the eternal battle for control of the controls 
no 
okay 
okay right 
mm-hmm 
what kind of things do we have to consider there 
can we what kind of size does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of 
mm-hmm 
okay 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
hinged yeah 
so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic the fascia that comes off would be the rubber 
like those pens that you get with the grip that you can you can pull that off 
okay 
mm 
well that's been really popular with mobile phones so i don't see why not 
'kay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
oh it would be flat inside 
mm 
i think it would be good to have a contrast between 
if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside 
now how would you distinguish if you had it bare how would you distinguish where you had to press i mean 
uh 
like one of the palm pop thing 
it would have to be attached 
okay we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that 
that's you right okay 
no 
we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women 
well it's a remote control 
you were sitting watching t. v. are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t. 
yeah no no 
mm 
okay 
okay okay 
mm 
mm 
okay 
which means 
okay 
okay 
mm-hmm 
can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part 
'cause if you're thinking about holding it 
you would be using your thumbs to press just like a mobile phone 
yeah 
that's what i was just saying and then have the and then have the l. c. d. at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls 
so have the um the volume and the programme things like that on the lower side 
okay 
i can't see that is that play and stop and things 
or is that volume and channel 
okay 
right 
okay 
um 
i'm not sure how long we've got left but we need to make a decision about um 
the things we've discussed 
so we agree on 
do we agree on the battery 
yeah 
um that means that there's no function for li the port 
you know that it sits in then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it 
it's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget it's a 
selling point 
i think the only 
i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else 
but i think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things 
the l. c. d. 's not cheap 
yeah okay 
and you could yeah 
okay 
do you want like a back up 
um okay so we've got battery 
the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it 
so there's not a really a decision to be made there um 
the buttons what did you give us as our 
the bare board l. c. d. or 
on the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then 
okay okay 
no it's fine 
for the inside 
mm-hmm 
oh i think so i think so 
no i think i we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap 
so we could make it red 
we could make it um psychedelic you know we could make it black and white zebra stripes 
but that's not really what we're focusing on what we're focusing on is the m you know yes 
so we could just pick anything 
it's just different it's just different from everything else and i mean i'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses 
sort of beige and black um so you either want something that goes with that 
which is what's on the market anyway 
or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and 
mm 
and you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do 
you could have um a plain black one you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little 
mm 
and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know you could just go so far with it 
like a puffer fish you could just you could take it wherever so i think that's quite a flexible thing 
yes 
mm 
yeah 
okay we've got five minutes um or that might've been up for a while 
mm-hmm 
have you 
okay 
well they do but i think we can you could well it is it is i think you just address that with um advertising 
um you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you 
obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything but everything else has a logo on it 
the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but i think it does without that so i'm not worried about that 
depending on how i i mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into so 
um that seems to make sense but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else then it's worth thinking about 
but i think we'll find out more about cost afterwards 
right i'm going to wrap it up there 
i got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so 
um 
so i think we've probably got it says closing we have forty minutes so i um think we've probably got about that time before we come back 
it's either that or 
we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took 
is everyone happy 
okay 
yeah yeah i was getting that impression as well 
etcetera 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah okay 
that screwed in 
yeah 
'kay 
okay 
um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment 
okay first uh the 
into the method 
the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t. v. and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find 
um also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials 
'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available 
um findings i've got my nice little picture there 
this is uh the chip called the t. a. double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals 
based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all t. v. remotes at the moment 
um and then we we're loo looking into battery options 
there's um actually no rechargeable option available 
so we i saw the um the standard double a. and triple a. which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment 
dynamo charging i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest people won't it's it's basically like wind up radio 
so you wind up your remote control before you use it 
it might 
you 
yeah yeah oh yeah i presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long 
but i don't i don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options 
like the the solar charging 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got t. v. 
no 
is it 
alright i 
yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up 
yeah okay 
but 
yeah and most people most people also watch t. v. in the in the night anyway 
but i i think i think the the next one's the best anyway 
the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it 
i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up 
i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work 
um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery 
'cause they use them quite frequently in watches 
and that'll that would l would last for um well i do i d i'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i've never seen one run out 
yeah 
yeah and 
yeah but then again i i think it is because if you think about it the watch 
although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side 
and th for the same the same reason 
you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no i do i don't think the the draw on it would be 
mm 
ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because 
if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical 
they're they're expensive they don't 
yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest i'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones um but the 
it's i i think they're not very resistant to dropping 
'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff 
so 
y i think yeah practically 
i mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do they can t 
yeah they do they yeah they've got dual things but they're the batteries are smaller i think 
mm 
w m yeah so the 
yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard 
batteries and the solar charging um 
i don't think you'd i think the it would d well you know how long the standard double a. s would last in or triple a. s would last 
yeah i think i i think it would yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
okay well i'll move on 
um my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh p. c. b. board which pr printed circuit board 
which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button 
it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this l. e. d. in the sequence of l on and off bursts 
well 
well this the thi the thing about is um 
they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in 
if you if you see how thin the tracks are 
you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one 
if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that or you could have some sort of 
array of switches which i'll speak about in the next bit so that 
and then to uh yeah so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used 
now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things they've got little lights on behind the buttons 
so you can see what all the buttons are like on a mobile phone they do it more often than on a than on a t. v. remote 
but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i'd have that turned off 
if we decided to go for buttons that could light up 
um the case material i've a been sent what the factory can actually give us 
the there's the plastic which i think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and 
the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but i think it would be a bit impractical 
titanium um very expensive just to process which to make it is expensive and rubber 
well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year so perhaps uh some something made of rubber 
but i was thinking more of the buttons because the buttons which they've they've said 
that they've they've put across 
are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti r. s. i. 
i'm no i'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said 
um the problem with the casing is that uh there's 
quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case 
if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape 
whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes 
but whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units 
for the flip phone 
yeah 
yeah i th 
uh 
yeah in in titanium i don't i don't think it would be available at all really 
the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium 
it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it 
because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for 
for a remote 
yeah yeah 
rubber yeah 
and you can peel them off yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons the i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen 
now what i was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare p. c. b. circuit board and i'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection 
over if you had them close enough that would be one option 
um the second option th they offer rubber buttons 
but i thought that an l. c. d. type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space 
two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch 
display 
uh what what 
oh on the on the l. c. d. screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it 
but um you can you wouldn't have with the l. c. d. you'd have the wires coming off you wouldn't have that with the 
with the l. c. d. you'd only have that with the printed circuit board 
with 
w also with the 
yeah 
you could have a flat screen inside yeah but i'm just wondering whether we want an l. c. d. screen inside 
it wouldn't be like full colour it would just be black and white but there'd be touch touch buttons 
so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti r. s. i. 
is rubber 
mm 
yeah i hadn't i hadn't really thought of that to be honest 
yeah you could 
you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but i i think they could get a bit easily lost 'cause i had 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah okay 
yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my 
yeah 
uh yeah 
yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple 
i mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them 
'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking 
mm 
um 
yeah 
i mean you can you could do it 
you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an l. c. d. display it'll completely blank it out 
but i don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it i'm not sure about 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
if you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l. c. d. screen 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah but you can do it with your thumb li 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well yeah we 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah i think i mean if 
yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock 
then it won't be cheap to re manufacture them uh or it will be cheap sorry to re manufacture them 
so do you reckon that's a good idea that where's the remote i'm here thing 
i think that would be quite fun 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one 
i mean they use them in calculators so 
yeah 
well you cou um 
k no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch 
so it's a lot smaller so it would 
yeah 
yeah the well i think were we're going for the l. c. d. on that one on the buttons 
on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah 
on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber the rubber ones the anti r. s. i. ones 
um okay on we've got the flip the flip screen the top one is gonna be the l. c. d. and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons 
plastic okay 
yeah 
mm no 
mm 
you can you can just 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case just the rubber thing that goes round the outside 
oh yeah yeah the whistle ones yeah 
yeah 
yeah depending on the expense of it 
and they've got in stock so yeah 
yeah 
okay 
did it 
oh good grief 
'kay 
oh 
mm 
mm-hmm 
shall i 
okay 
we just connect up 
thank you 
there we go 
okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching 
um 
the methods we used to decide on uh 
current trends and so on market trends 
were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w i'm sorry i'm slightly tongue tied after lunch 
sorry project manager 
um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later 
so that was one of the first things we did 
also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology 
we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan 
uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel 
rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls 
they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative 
and of course as we predicted that it should be easy to use 
now i should point out that the first of those findings fancy look and feel is the most important 
is twice as important as the second technologically innovative which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use 
so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important 
but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at 
okay um now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group 
um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there 
that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture 
so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too 
there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials uh again in contrast to last year 
so a lot of interesting feedback there both from our market research departments and from our people in paris and milan 
be interesting to see what our design people make of that 
unless anyone has any questions about that 
not yet 
'kay 
okay 
i know 
does does light charge as as sunlight does 
artificial light 
has to be solar 
mm 
artificial light no 
that's going to 
i know different parts of the world too if we're if we're marketing internationally 
mm-hmm 
hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
could i just ask referring back to solar charging is that compatible with um standard batteries 
i mean 
could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible 
mm 
so that affects the exterior design 
mm 
again it de 
mm 
it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature i it's not gonna add anything okay 
shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because i i personally right okay 
it's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research it's not a thing that people are looking for 
when we threw it open to the field yeah 
but it's something to put on the side to think about maybe 
mm 
okay 
mm 
it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall 
i've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it 
i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over 
that would give the spongy feel that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone 
like a rubber sleeve almost yeah 
mm 
mm 
very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to 
mm 
yeah 
mm 
i don't s sorry to interrupt i don't see why the curved thing is a problem 
if we for example had a shell once we open that yeah so it'd be f yeah yeah 
have i misunderstood you 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
i just had another idea i don't know if it helps with that but just to do with the r. s. i. 
is it possible just as an option when we open it up people can use their fingers to press the button 
or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to 
mm 
yeah 
they're easy to replace as well cheap 
mm-hmm 
mm 
yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got couldn't they 
a pencil or a pen so they wouldn't really need a 
mm-hmm 
i'll just raise another point while it occurs to me it kind of applies to both our designers here so i'm not sure how it would fit in 
if we flip open 
now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display 
you seen those 
and they kind of respond to the turn of your body 
is it possible that when we open our flip top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing 
they don't look at themselves 
just a thought 
yeah 
i know what you mean 
it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think 
okay 
trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side 
'kay 
mm 
oh i think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah 
sorry what does that stand for 
okay 
no you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be 
wouldn't you 
isn't that the idea 
you us if we just use the shell as an example again you open that 
you've got your l. c. d. display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm 
kinetic 
mm 
mm 
hmm 
yeah we talked about kinetic charging we've deci seem to have decided on that did we decide on double a. or triple a. batteries 
no 
one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a. or triple a. batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they 
i oh i see 
right okay got you 
got you on that okay didn't realise 
sorry could you repeat that last part 
l. c. d. screen 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm-hmm so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell a variety of designs okay 
and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours 
we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else like a shell that we discussed just go for the colours 
okay 
mm-hmm 
the feel 
'kay 
mm-hmm 
is that going to be this image i've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that maybe about that size 
made of plastic fits into the palm of the hand rubberised cover that's spongy 
is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted market research is that fancy 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
i'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else but i mean i totally agree 
we looked at those remotes i mean they are kind of anonymous very similar looking things 
this would definitely be different enough i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more 
well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce 
that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming i mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on 
which is another beauty of it 
mm so can i just recap uh sarah for the decisions that we've made kinetic charging the watch type batteries 
um l. c. d. display on th the top side of the flip top 
rubberised buttons on the bottom side we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover the case itself is plastic 
that's how far we've got what else do we have to add to our decisions here 
mm 
yes it was just there was just a cost issue with that 
but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost is that right 
and incorporating the company logo 
mm 
'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report 
it's not just a case of having a little r. r. hidden somewhere they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they 
since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
okay 
did we i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper 
i think that was you talked about a beeper for a location have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then 
you got to go through 
hmm 
thank you 
hmm 
hmm 
yep me too 
mm-hmm 
yep 
me and william worked on a prototype and i think william is going to make a p presentation on that 
yeah 
i can hold it like 
yeah so 
it looks 
crazy 
um not now 
oh 
yeah 
oh where are the hinges 
'kay 
you able to look 
yep 
the black and white touch screen wherein people can 
right 
mm-hmm 
'kay 
ah oka 
infrared could be here also 
yeah here 
so when it's even if it's open here the signals would go 
yeah 
this one right here 
which is 
no 
look up to it 
yay 
so this is the one 
sorry 
evaluation 
mm um i i think this is chip 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
ah it's perfect 
is it everybody is going to evaluate or just the market okay 
'kay 
yeah so you can 
'kay 
i would say four 
mm-hmm 
almost three 
i think yeah 
oh sorry i i got it wrong 
the first one rating i'm sorry 
can you just make it two 
the first 
yeah i i just it the other way 
uh in 
yep i just got 
two point f 
one is a seven is false okay 
two 
two 
white 
with for the plastic 
uh blue 
any 
right 
mm-hmm 
yeah because you'll be having a 
because of the rubber case 
one 
mm 
four 
voice r recognition 
hmm 
you want me to b unplug that 
that's all 
yes 
okay 
chip on print 
okay 
yep 
single curved 
two curves yeah 
single cu 
plastic and rubber 
yeah 
plastic one and maybe rubber point five 
no i think rubber since it's being used just as a casing we can put point five 
yeah because there are 
i think it allows the point five yeah 
we can use that 
it means we are not using a lot of rubber actually 
we're using just 
a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic 
push button 
one 
an 
one 
i think we could change the battery also 
instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery 
uncurved flat 
no it just surprises one 
i don't think so 
ri i think it's in euro 
and going to a regular bat 
yeah 
what i feel is customers never said anything about the battery 
it's internal nobody looks into the battery 
but shape and colours that's something we shouldn't comprimi 
where's that special form 
mm mm mm 
mm-hmm 
make it costly 
yeah we are close to the budget 
two five 
it's twelve point five maybe then 
i don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost 
so half of the price would be 
i think it is the first one 
so we are under the budget 
seems fine 
except voice recognition everything is 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
i think we had a nice time 
yeah i think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody 
it's not like people trying to cut each other 
there is more of uh true cohesive teamwork 
we came to a very predic creative design yeah 
yeah and uh 
yeah i think 
and sarah you coordinated the work very well 
yeah 
i think that was the best part of the 
'kay 
yeah moving around the room 
but i think it's good like uh we spent times individually 
i never thought of a remote control with a flip top 
that's mine 
yeah it's 
the thing is 
yep sorry go on sarah 
surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones like a real want to see a new launch or something like that 
and new f television products coming up but nobody giving uh much idea to this 
like sarah was telling everything's 
right 
mm-hmm 
maybe fifty percent more 
yeah 
who knows 
yeah 
there's a final questionnaire 
celebration you didn't talk about that 
yeah 
if you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time 
is that 
three apparently 
okay you all switched on 
i presume we're good to go 
okay um 
minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger 
standard chip um 'cause it can come in various different sizes it wasn't uh 
uh gonna be a problem factor 
we wanted a stand by function 
the case material is gonna be soft rubbery changeable 
um buttons with a combination of l. c. d. and rubber according to the design 
um bright funky designs inspired by fruit keeping with the hip kind of feel 
um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that 
um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti r. s. i. 
okay 
prototype presentation 
i think that would be you 
make sure the camera's 
yes yes you can 
wait a second i'll get it out 
um 
okay 
you should have one of those things and you can just take it off 
ta da 
right 
mm 'kay 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm 
so it's flush 
oh right okay yeah 
so put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections 'cause it's the top part that's okay 
okay 
i'm under the sofa 
or that would be too complicated 
infrared 
like here 
okay 
actually no it would be it would have to be on the on the front 
oh right yeah okay yeah i've got you 
it's still pointing yes 
yeah that would make sense 
okay 
but not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's 
okay 
thank you very much 
wrapping it all up okay 
um i've now got evaluation criteria 
it's to be presented 
okay 
it's quite similar to what it was before though 
sorry 
mm-hmm 
okay 
just write small 
yeah 
that works 
mm-hmm 
i would agree 
okay 
i would say two 
a two 
it's just two point five for that one 
i would say a two 
i would say a two 
one point seven f five 
okay mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
one 
well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half the material minimises r. s. i. it's meant to 
um 
maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much 
so maybe because there's more space it's not kind of moving around trying to 
hit accurately the buttons in between 
it's quite obvious just big buttons 
um 
four 
a standard 
it would be 
and if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room you'd go into another room 
one 
i don't think so 
i think we yeah 
i think we're set 
do much apart from having a huge big 
don't think so 
okay thank you 
okay i've got finance here now 
i'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it if that's okay 
um 
thanks 
right 
now i presume 
that the screen will go blank 
that um 
okay 
we just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value 
so are we still on for kinetic 
okay 
see it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning 
um it might have influenced our choice 
right what's happening with the electronics 
double curved 
oh right okay 
thanks 
so would there be two 
one chip 
okay 
one double curve 
so what's a single curve then 
so just one double 
yeah 
um 
mm 
um we've got plastic and rubber haven't we 
um 
do you think 
okay 
it would be like saying we're using 
see it says case material 
so we're not actually using plastic in the case are we 
it's including it's including 
okay we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half 
or sh we should just put it in as one because the plastic is zero anyway 
no we don't step on anyone's toes 
okay special colour do we need that 
n yeah okay 
interface 
buttons 
has that not gone up 
oh no it was seven five it's changed not a lot 
oh it's not calculated it 
okay there we go 
it's not a lot though 
we haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though i think 
okay so the highest we've got is the electronics here 
um 
and the interface 
where's the 
where's the voice recognition 
right okay 
well the kinetic is three 
if we change it to the battery it's that's minus three 
oh right 
i keep seeing zero 
um 
we can do it some other way we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition 
we could do the voice recognition for you know business class or something you know like an upgraded version 
you could choose to have that or not 
so should we just change the design specification then 
yes 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay we can 
make the price fit and then say if we'd had our budget we would've had this because it also sets it apart from the crowd 
they like their gadgets they like something that's completely different 
it's s something completely different associated with your company 
right okay so 
it's two point five 
no it's twelve point two five 
yeah well two twelve point two five times two is 
twenty five isn't it 
i think the agenda one was where the um price was wasn't it 
no 
twelve point five 
well done people 
so is that uh got us covered for the electronics then 
we don't need something else to take that place 
okay 
okay 
right so we've done that 
okay 
product evaluation 
we've done room for creativity haven't we 
because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make 
um 
i presume we discussed leadership and teamwork 
um in the sense that 
um did you feel like a team 
or did you feel like uh autonomy 
mm-hmm 
thank you 
how did you find it 
yeah 
yeah 
i liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea but no one felt like shot down 
you know y it didn't matter it saying what you thought because if it wasn't something that was that relevant 
then it didn't matter 'cause it was just another idea in the field 
i like that 
um 
teamwork 
well you two created that wonderful specimen of a play doh model 
um uh i'm still not caught up 
but that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all 
um 
maybe 
no that was quite fun 
um means whiteboard digital pens etcetera what does that mean 
any ideas 
had time to kind of 
yeah 'cause we could just sort of say sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that 
rather than having to email it yeah 
but it was nice having it there 
um like the whole picture of the thing 
yeah i think it's new ideas in general rather than 
mm 
yeah no 
well they have to come from somewhere don't they 
and as sh as w sorry you go 
um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls remote controls no one's thought about it particularly 
i mean they're slightly different so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's 
'cause it's w something we should think about but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it 
mm 
but then when it everything is really smart and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table it doesn't go 
i mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing a funky item that's individual individual to you 
i mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic 
you would pray you would pay a lot extra because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you 
but people could have anything that they wanted 
because of the produ 
mm 
yes 
yeah 
well it's innovation for money's sake 
the the people have to keep buying 
yeah 
and you can't get you've got your handset that works fine but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone 
because the phones have moved on things like that 
yes 
it's madness 
um 
in closing 
there we go 
um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased but i think i don't know d what do you think 
do you think that's takes into account um 
overheads 
like us being well paid kind of a thing 
and the heating for the building do you think our budget includes everything all the costs that are going out 
so it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that 
so maybe increasing it you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at 
but i think but you were saying that that's quite 
hmm 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
it's a shame it won't ever get made 
maybe it will 
maybe someone'll r run down and patent it 
um the project has been evaluated well and truly 
um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire 
oh so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that i fell behind with 
so i'll be delegating in my um role as project supervisor so good luck 
i think the celebration is the twenty five pounds 
either that or we'll be dancing on the desks 
oh 
um yeah just the last i think 
i think i've got minutes for two of the meeting and the 
last thingy 
i just got con 
is that for us 
okay 
yeah shall i show 
i'll show 
though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and i'll i'll show you the presentation 
can i just nick your 
whoa 
going a bit crazy over here 
thank you 
okay so this is our look and feel presentation the final our final presentation 
and we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there 
um 
it's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour 
either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something 
this is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached 
but we can we can come up with that 
um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it 
um it's obviously an a sort of clam shell design and uh the um the top l. c. d. screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um 
how do you say it's yeah yeah 
it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat 
yeah yeah 
and working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries which actually 
thinking about it now could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well so that you could probably get a bit of 
yeah 
yeah 
um we decided that um the voice recognition system 
it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a hold of 
so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap 
so you'd have something like where you'd shout out where where is the remote and 
it'll shout back i'm here or something 
and then yeah 
it wo it won't shout out i'm here or something 
it'll just shout out i'm here or something to similar effect 
uh yeah if it was going like i d well tha that could be something for next time maybe 
you can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is 
um the standard there's be a standard transmission with the t. v. using using all the standard chips that we've talked about 
um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers 
it would need two separate p. c. b. s so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling 
and uh because obviously all t. v. s use this the same infrared medium we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data 
and the infrared 
um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer 
just at the front of the we haven't i don't think we actually put it on 
yeah yeah something like that 
yeah on the front on the front side of that yeah 
so when you've actually got it open it would be facing the t. v. 
and then finally um on to the interface 
the top screen as we said is would be an inset um black and white l. c. d. s touch screen which yeah would 
uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons 
like the vo volume up and down channel up and down power on and off and uh things to that effect 
and now we've we also decided on the inside we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled 
uh logo on it or something inset or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top 
no d not not actually 
no not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing 
and finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics as that is that's the company logo 
there you go 
yeah 
yeah okay 
yeah 
yeah i'd uh yeah i'd probably put it uh two yeah two or three 
no three 
three 
mm yeah 
yeah yeah 
i'd give it a one 
no no not at all 
yeah 
two 
two 
yeah 
d. 
one 
yeah 
yeah that's 
no no the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue 
but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised 
yeah yeah yeah and 
no no 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it 
that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic 
yeah i'll give it a one as well 
yeah 
mm 
no 
yeah 
it's meant to be 
yeah 
yeah i'd uh i'd f i'd go for a five actually 'cause 
yep 
yeah 
yeah it was it was uh a voice voice recognition yeah 
yeah yeah that yeah that's feasible 
um i think it would r 
i think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud 
so it would be s p yeah 
yeah 
yeah one 
i do realise that we might be being fairly biased 'cause it is our product but 
w i thin yeah i think yeah 
mm 
no 
yeah 
it was a regular chip on print and 
oh no no no the um 
yeah it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells there should just be one 
in the top it's the number of c yeah 
yeah and yeah just a no one reg v uh 
yeah one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker 
and they're double curved 
no 
y 
two 'cause it's two 
yeah i'd say i'd say it was w yeah i think i think it's 
one double curved 
and one no 'cause one yeah one's double curved and then the other one's 
a plastic 
yeah 
and special colour 
yeah 
yeah 
no no that's it's as an extra 
so that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get 
yeah okay 
yeah the push button's one and l. c. display one 
and buttons 
well yes 
yeah 
no we'll have 
no no you've got to click off to calculate it again 
c it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in euros 
it could be in dollars 
and then it would be fine because the exchange range would make it about twelve 
no 
yeah the standard it um it would make one difference 
the biggest one would be taking away if you took away 
if you to 
yeah 
if if you take away the voice i i do i don't like to say it 
but if you take away the voice recognition then you've got it 
yeah i yeah 
no 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker 
if you took away that that'll make it twelve point three five 
they n n yeah but you p minus three plus two 
yeah 
but they but i mean in i don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five euros now 
because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product 
yeah 
we c we could s 
yeah we could say 
yeah i s 
and then say we recommend 
yeah 
yeah 
that'll do it 
twelve point three five 
is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty 
ah 
okay 
yeah 
no 
'cause that that was just a bought on extra you could just take that out 
and that would be fine yeah 
yeah i think that's brilliant 
yeah 
yes 
yeah i'd say as a team 
yeah 
find out from each other yeah 
yeah 
yeah no i thought it it went really well and i yeah 
i i feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out 
although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there but that's that's good 
i think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out 
i think maybe it would've come out a d little different but yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah well 
discuss which ones yeah 
yeah 
yeah i think i think we probably woulda used the outer email system more had we actually 
had had more time and if we'd been separated more 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
vegetables 
yeah 
no 
yeah i do i don't think the the companies are really concerned 
they're just like we've got a d. v. d. player does anyone remember the remote control 
can't you get the one that we used for the last one 
yeah just jazz it up a bit 
uh d they don't really think about it because normally the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship 
they're trying to ship the d. v. d. player the video player the t. v. 
yeah 
yeah 
no 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
well 
i think that was just the the physical 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i think yeah i don't from the market research 
no 
yeah it was 
i it's top secret 
um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here 
that's what it is 
in your yeah 
okay 
is that it then 
awesome 
was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your 
thing 
i don't think 
yeah the the s yeah 
i think yeah questionnaire seven was the one i did just before the meeting 
mm 
is that someone's 
okay 
or something 
well done 
certainly 
logged in 
thank you 
oops 
okay 
this stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research 
so this is the first stage of the evaluation 
now the collection of the criteria as we saw in our previous meeting 
was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company 
so it's what we've discussed in the last meeting are we actually meeting those trends and requirements 
now the findings that we came up with just a recap are here 
the criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel technological innovation it should be easy to use 
it should incorporate current fashion trends and those the two main ones they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours 
the design should minimise r. s. i. and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there 
though that did seem to be the favoured strategy but there was also on the sideline the though of maybe having a beeper function 
okay so we can come back to that slide if you don't have a note of those 
i'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this to what we have so far 
we're going to use a seven point scale where one is true and seven is false 
we look at each of those criteria that i've just mentioned i'll call that slide back up 
and i will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here 
does that seem clear 
any questions there 
so we're going to look at these crite 
yes we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven 
is that okay 
one is true seven is false 
right 
so i won't write all of that out again 
it will just be criteria one two three four five six or a. b. 
c. d. e. f. to confuse it with the number rating 
b. c. d. e. f. 
this is where i realise how tiny i actually am 
criteria 
and rating 
actually it might be an idea if we each did give our own individual rating and we could take an average at the end 
how about that 
okay 
so i'll just separate the ratings by obliques and if we go one two three four we know who's who 
okay 
criteria a. the fancy look and feel 
how do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel 
one is true seven is false 
my own rating for that would be a two 
one is true and seven is false 
i'll just go this way 
two 
okay 
two 
a four okay 
adding those up we've got a six and a five eleven divided by four is what 
uh two and three quarters it that right 
two and three quarters 
okay 
two point seven five there we go 
okay criteria b. criterion b. technologically innovative 
i would give that a three 
okay 
not that you're biased in that it the designer 
the average oh for you 
you want your rating to be a two 
is that what you're saying 
okay 
so i'll work out the average for that again at the end 
it's a very slightly altered 
okay and we're just waiting for your rating f 
two point five okay 
losing one decimal place that's okay 
so what are you rating for this one paw 
two okay 
so that is eight 
that brings it down to two nice and simple yeah 
okay ease of use 
easy to use 
based on what you've said there i would say a one true 
two 
a two okay 
two 
i should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy shouldn't i 
we'll just put almost two because i'm not gonna get into silly decimal places 
okay 
or we or if we want to really bring it down we can do later 
um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends 
now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours 
right 
so i'm just thinking before i give it my rating you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here 
is this actually going to be the colours that you would use 
right 
so we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do 
okay 
and the spongy feel is no problem with that 
okay 
in that case it's got to be a one for me 
yep 
everybody 
okay 
that part was nice and easy 
okay 
uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury 
i don't think we've really touched on that a lot 
we've we've discussed it we haven't really come up with anything that 
we felt could feasibly reduce that 
we've talked about pointers but the very use of a remote control if you're someone who's zapping 
who's sitting like that and we found so many people did how do you minimise that on such a small device 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
right 
right 
i think i'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four 
a five okay 
four and a four okay 
twenty one is that twenty one 
so that's four point two five 
and finally last but not least easy to locate 
now we talked about voice recognition we talked about a beeper have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that 
it was the i'm here thing yep 
and are we happy with the costs on that 
that is going to be feasible cost wise 
that sounds good then 
i'd go for a i ca we can adjust the volume on that just as we could volume on t. v. 
so if sombody's in the other room or if t. v. s in different rooms or 
right 
okay 
you built into the feature 
okay 
logical 
that's a one for me 
one and one good 
so how do we feel about this 
we've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there 
that is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate 
the lowest rating we've got which is really n it's not terribly low i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury 
do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it 
or do we have to make further modifications 
we happy to go ahead 
yeah 
i think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that 
and i really doubt if 
on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities we could actually do much more to minimise that 
i know 
okay 
well i hope that's uh clear to the team 
is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before i 
sum up 
good 
fine then 
i'll just leave it there 
oops 
oh yes 
yes 
but it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit 
so it can rest 
it would just be a flat bottom with one curve 
like a domed thing 
mm 
the other curves at the sides but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over 
yeah 
what does it mean if you put point five for that 
mm-hmm 
right okay 
but it is gonna be part of the total cost and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in is there 
there's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing 
so do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there 
okay 
mm 
might do if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours 
s 
has that not made any d if you click off that square now has that not made any difference 
is it oh it's brought it slightly down 
so is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing is that going to make a difference 
oh it's not made any difference has it 
oh 
it's brought it down slightly 
is there anything on the menu 
no 
if we tr um 
if we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries would that make a huge difference 
and people are used to buying batteries they're not gonna say i'm not getting this 'cause i've got to buy a battery for a remote control 
should we see what difference it makes 
um 
yeah 
sure 
but we're still working to um head o 
we can put in our recommendations 
if we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for 
we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings 
but we need to work to that specification to start with 
and i think the voice recognition sounds wonderful 
but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance 
um as you say we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so 
mm 
yeah 
'cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it 
yeah 
so if we take voice recognition out 
we are 
are you sure 
sorry not meaning to doubt your words there 
right 
are they really going to quibble about ten p. 
or point zero one of a euro 
which is less than ten p. 
that's today's 
kick off meeting 
mm 
i thought that's what it was 
so we're okay 
although we had our separate tasks there was so much interaction so much that we needed to um bounce off each other 
and i've certainly felt heard listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to you know give and take and adjust our remit where necessary 
yeah 
maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line 
and fake r. c. s 
how do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information 
could it've been better was it adequate 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
it's really borrowing from other areas it's you know bringing things from other areas in 
it so it's i mean nothing is new but it's applying it to a d in a different area 
absolutely yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah the focus isn't on to that yeah 
i think it's really good that this has been very market research based because just going back to mobile phones 
i mean this is the first change in remote control devices that i can really you know say is is obvious and visible 
we see it in mobile phones a lot and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from 
there are innovations in that that people don't really want 
i see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake 
and i think it's wonderful our company's so r. and d. based 
yeah 
but forcing it onto people yeah 
it's things that you know they might want to buy the thing they really want 
mm 
mm 
or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever yeah 
see i think 
i think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone 
mm-hmm 
but i think in the remit that we were given it was very specific 
i think we've done what we were required to do 
and i think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things 
i don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for 
i think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that i think people are really gonna want 
i know 
maybe it will 
maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it 
mm-hmm 
questionnaire 
questionnaire done 
oh i didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time 
oh right 
but do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too 
yeah 
okay 
everybody ready 
uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves 
and everybody's name and what your function is 
so maybe we start with you 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm-hmm 
and your name is 
okay 
very good 
and as you already know i am betty 
i am the project manager for today 
so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do 
um 
yes y opening acquaintance tool training well 
the tools are i think we already i guess the tool is really our the computer as far as i can see 
uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there 
project plan that falls under the same heading pretty much 
um i don't think we have any great discussion at this point 
um 
here is what this thing should be 
this thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control 
uh should be original trendy and of course user friendly 
so maybe you wanna make some notes of that 
okay 
all right 
here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve 
um 
that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with 
the same goes for the conceptual design there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards 
detailed design same thing basically 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
i can't write with this thing 
yes 
yeah okay 
all right 
then tool training try out the white board participant can draw their favourite animal 
does anybody want to go and see how the white board works 
so that in case we have to in the next meeting present something on the white board 
you wanna go eileen and 
whether you without hanging yourself 
and remember you have to press so it works 
mm-hmm 
fat a fat cat 
okay 
and you're francine right 
would you like s like just to see um how it feels so that you have a little idea 
in 
no no 
no that's okay 
i don't know we'll get to that later 
okay 
okay 
here's the project finance uh which of course we all have to think about when we design this thing 
um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro 
uh profit aim for the company is fifty million euro the market range unlimited meaning international 
and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro 
mm-hmm 
so these are all things of course to remember with the budget and when you design to materials cost etcetera 
now uh the discussion i guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control 
i exp i s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em right everyday 
and um 
now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it 
things you would like to change things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas 
would you like it to be smaller bigger have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons you know things like that 
small right 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
so it should be a multi functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically 
well 
it should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have 
now of course the other thing to think there is maybe the design 
like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know 
maybe it should different colours or materials or you know 
um so yeah shapes right you know like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something you know 
yeah 
yes 
that is true because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or we you know whatever 
and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t. v. off and they say where the hell is my my remote control yeah 
well or yeah or if it's really if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
so if lost 
if lost uh signal with b throw signal you know 
exactly i mean just that's what i'm saying 
i'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or 
okay my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden 
in in other words if it's like in a dark spot uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top 
a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant 
at that moment it's it's like it's like um what you call it a light s sensors you know 
in in that moment it has a sensor i it it gets a certain darkness 
it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep 
i mean that we can discuss that later you know 
that's right 
you know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and i i think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough 
uh i know there are the lamps and stuff you know you can clap on and off but i think they only work to certain degree and 
what with 
oh yeah well but then those people we can't help everybody 
okay we have uh yeah we have to move along but i think we have some good good points to start with here 
okay the next meeting will be in thirty minutes 
i think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this 
okay so well you got the notice um uh 
the working design i guess that's the function i. d. uh who is this 
the industrial designer that's you 
okay 
so we looking for a working design when we come back 
then 
and then the technical funct you are the technical function so so you are the working design 
so you have a working design and then a functional design 
and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification like friendliness and what we just discussed in general 
that would be your idea 
and of course price 
that it that it that the price is a good price 
i mean the price is given but that was 
that's right 
that's right 
and you know specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that 
i think that's the end of the show 
yeah 
so um we have well we have a twen two two two three minutes 
um any questions at this point 
or uh suggestions 
i think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh uh i guess you can uh 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
then uh we see you in about thirty minutes 
and see what we can come up with 
okay 
okay 
yeah my name is francina 
and i'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface 
and my role is to design uh a television remote control 
yes i'm francina 
yes sure 
no okay 
what should i draw 
i'm going to draw a snake 
how does it look like 
yes 
yeah i 
yes i i feel that all the remote should be very compact 
yeah those which we get here nowadays it's very long 
and um and it should have multi purpose 
like uh the remote control which we use for t. v. it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also 
like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air conditioners or for heating system 
yes exactly 
yes 
yes 
yeah 
exactly 
yeah 
yeah design should be yeah it should be different 
all the almost all the remotes 
yes exactly 
are different shapes 
yes 
yes 
or a b 
should ha 
a fluorescent signal yeah 
yes 
yeah 
and uh 
yes 
then in that case 
yes 
okay 
okay 
yes 
yes 
okay 
yes 
yeah 
yeah 
uh i'm jeanne oui 
um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design 
snake 
yeah of course using remote control 
yeah 
uh 
yeah 
yeah 
audio player 
oh 
okay 
divides us yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah of course 
yeah maybe ten i do yeah colours and al shapes also 
yeah 
yeah of course yeah 
yeah 
yeah some beep or something like that so that we can go 
yeah 
yeah maybe it should have a light so that we can we can just recognise where it is 
yeah yeah 
may not be beep 
beep or uh it's a light maybe it's a light 
yeah probably yeah probably it's a yeah yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah of course that didn't 
i i we can't do it 
yeah good point 
me yeah 
yeah 
yeah it's functional de yeah exactly technical 
yeah 
uh working design yeah it's it's uh mainly technical functional design 
yeah functional design and you 
yeah 
yeah even i have 
yeah even i have i think yeah 
yeah so let's see 
hmm 
yeah 
okay 
i think so 
yeah that's a good plan 
and i'm a marketing person 
i wanna figure out how to sell them 
my name is eileen 
okay 
mm-hmm 
no 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm 'kay so 
three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay 
functional conception 
and detailed 
maybe we should redesign it 
after we've finished the remote control we'll get to that 
okay i'll see what i can do 
see if i r 
see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something 
so that it will record okay 
um uh um traditional kitty cat 
i've a very fat cat 
and it likes to sit like that 
okay 
am i supposed to wipe off that or okay 
okay 
uh okay 
i hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause i don't like snakes 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged 
profit 
um is fifty mm 
oops 
at um twelve fifty euros per 
well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that 
we certainly can try to i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things 
that's right 
yeah okay friendly shape that would help 
i think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them 
they can't find it 
mm-hmm 
so some 
uh so so it's really the beep or or a light should blink 
mm 'kay 
and do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay so 
okay 
so the light sensor would activate the signal 
mm-hmm 
but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it 
well because you're s because you're silly 
because people are silly 
i mean it could be on well i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um 
you know well maybe we have to move along okay 
mm-hmm 
we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price 
mm 
okay i think i have enough to think about 'til our next meeting 
how about you people 
really 
okay 
'kay 
alright well uh 
okay very good 
okay is everybody ready 
mm-hmm 
um i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um 
i think the marketing manager probably should go first addressing the needs and desires 
yeah mm-hmm 
okay 
you're participant four 
okay and now i can uh full screen 
uh okay okay 
uh okay can can i at this point interject um something 
um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered 
um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext because that's sort of outdated with the internet 
and according to to higher management the it should only control the t. v. 
mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things and they are concerned with the time to market 
okay 
um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained 
and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product 
so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company 
and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out 
so i just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at 
these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things so it's only gonna be t. v. 
but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea 
mm 'kay 
okay 
and uh 
who would be next uh i guess that would be you 
mm-hmm 
you want me to get your slide show up 
mm-hmm 
and you are number three 
number two 
okay 
okay 
mm-hmm 
yep 
yeah yeah uh-huh 
there mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yo and it's yeah but it's so 
yep 
yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now 
mm-hmm 
yeah i 
it just build a mould basically and uh you know 
as the budget we're looking at if you build one mould i don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or 
oh yes 
i think i think we will have to look at the budget on that but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun 
you know 
yeah 
silly for children 
like an animal or 
yeah 
yeah a little elderly a little arthritic hand you know 
and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know 
mm mm-hmm 
mm-hmm mm-hmm 
yes 
yes 
yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh 
mm-hmm 
yeah mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
holder yeah mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
well you don't have to 
this one 
and francine 
you are number two 
you're three 
would you want it full full screen 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
on the on on the remote 
yeah mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
right 
mm-hmm 
yes 
by your child mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
timer yeah mm-hmm mm-hmm 
uh okay now i have 
on my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that 
however uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group 
and uh what function working design how how does it work 
so these are the two things we should come up wit with 
so uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group 
um 
i guess in many ways everybody 
everybody who has a t. v. 
yeah and i think today there are probably not many people who don't have a t. v. 
there are a few but in general not 
now talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody but i think within the target group we have subgroups 
we have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands 
so i think that's uh one group that's certainly important 
um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear 
and uh i don't know how much we want to cater to children's use 
i mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not 
so this these are just some thoughts i have on it 
and um i dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes 
whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups 
mm-hmm 
that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but i think uh i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups 
i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours 
you know like you make it nice and pink fluorescent banana colour or whatever you know yeah for example you know 
but the question is really who is our target group 
do we look at one target group 
and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have uh i'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at 
sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us 
out of the cost we are supposed to respect 
right 
with with 
mm-hmm 
well that's that's 
yeah 
no 
the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function 
and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know within the target group or subgroups 
the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense 
i mean the basic design i understand will be the same 
but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example 
so that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t. v. 
yeah well that's that's the question 
well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones 
they have like removable plastic cases 
so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one or whatever and maybe something like that 
that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package 
and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately 
you know yes 
that's right 
and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package 
then they can go to the store and for a few uh francs or euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know 
well i think i think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way 
um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um 
five minutes that was i guess tha that's the old message 
finish meeting now 
um um 
but i think i i think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody 
if money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that 
do we agree do we 
do we agree on on that in principle like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not 
okay 
so now i understand it's lunch break 
and um 
so that's what we will do 
so hank you very much 
and we'll see you after lunch 
yes 
okay 
okay 
what features 
s sellable 
yes 
yes 
okay 
okay 
receive 
multi purpose 
eliminated 
mm-hmm colours 
yes exactly 
yes 
like a doll or 
yes 
yes 
okay 
something else 
channels 
yes 
yes 
mm yeah 
yes 
hmm 
okay 
to keep the remote 
yeah 
a case holder 
a holder remote holder 
participant two 
yes 
no no i'm three 
i can make it full 
yes yes yes 
okay 
as uh user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote 
yeah can you please go onto the next slide 
so i found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance 
now for that 
uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t. v. and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t. v. 
there should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it 
now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice 
yes 
yes 
so if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time 
and the t. v. will automatically it will switch on at that particular time 
so he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age 
then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel 
and uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote 
uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t. v. television 
and um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t. in alphabet for more compactability 
and uh and uh and it is one more point which i noted it down 
like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person 
and it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p. m. then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock 
and i don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote 
yes and as john reece said the buttons can be 
uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently 
so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel 
and uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote 
he uh he should not be harmed in any way 
and findings uh i found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used 
there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh 
so uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television 
next slide 
and these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use 
not 
uh no uh like it can it can be used as a t. v. control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock 
and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that 
and if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically 
so that nobody else comes later and use it 
timer 
yeah and then you can use a timer as well 
yes 
yeah that's it 
okay 
t. v. television we was 
mm-hmm 
different colours 
yes 
okay 
no uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems 
yes 
but in a family in a family there will be a aged person children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes 
they would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh 
cost effective 
okay 
yes 
okay 
um 
yes 
but uh yeah i i have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people 
okay 
of th okay 
okay 
mm-hmm 
okay mm-hmm 
yes 
okay 
yeah 
mm 
open 
and then full screen 
mm-hmm 
'kay 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
hmm-hmm 
mm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
mm mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
complicated yeah of course 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 'kay 
yeah yeah sure 
thank you 
number two yeah 
yeah exactly 
uh can you make it uh full screen please 
no it's like a well you you have to press here 
the cup cup shape here 
the thir third 
yeah exactly 
uh so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller 
um can you go to the next sli slide please 
the metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller 
it takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that 
it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device 
like a t. v. or a air conditioner something like that so 
uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device 
if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is 
it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal 
and the t. v. it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that 
change the volume control and uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices 
uh yeah 
um 
so uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there 
so uh you can control whatever you want 
you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh t. v. or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t. v. can perform the actions 
so can you go to the next slide please 
so i i just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um i think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also 
it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark 
and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action 
there can be no action taking to that so 
and there should be a child lock 
like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller 
if make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but i think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay 
yeah yeah 
and uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh 
yeah yeah yeah and colours also different colours and 
no no no it won't uh i don't think it will be like you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more 
yeah yeah 
it's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter 
yeah 
yeah that is also possible i uh yeah i i yeah 
yeah that will be 
yeah yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah for children yeah exactly 
yeah that's what yeah 
yeah exactly 
yeah 
and and the butto buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons 
if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated 
if you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive 
so i think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations 
like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour 
so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so 
yep yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah it's like you know yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah yes 
yeah yeah you don't us yeah yeah usually 
yeah 
yeah shapes also different shapes 
yeah that will 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh 
so yeah 
and uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it i i don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's 
yeah and we display a clock 
yeah 
yeah and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so 
yeah 
yeah 
uh can you go to the next slide please 
uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch 
and uh bulbs 
like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the t. v. is on suppose 
then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light 
then it will be like if you switch on your t. v. through anoth another source 
not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light 
maybe we can have that 
whenever the t. v. is on remote controller will have a light 
and then uh infrared bulbs 
um this is like uh when it is dark 
and battery there should be a battery for power supply and a chip 
chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations 
and wires connecting all chips which is uh lights everything so there should be wires 
and uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and 
you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape 
yeah 
yeah holder 
um uh can you move onto the next slide 
um next sli slide please 
um i have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website uh from where i have uh uh i got s few points 
that's it that's it from me now 
um 
uh it's not like that 
i have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so 
yeah if you want 
yeah it's okay 
uh it's actually there now there on the screen 
mm 
yeah sure 
if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock 
hmm 
it's like a t okay it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television 
mm t. v. yeah 
don't t. v. yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
we can design different remotes for different people like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know 
yeah 
children and everybody yeah 
yeah of course that we can do 
but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children 
like in a different you know 
no it it doesn't cost yeah 
yeah 
doesn't doesn't doesn't matter 
yeah 
hmm-hmm 
uh no 
mm i i i don't think no 
it's not 
hmm 
yeah like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers like designs and all so that w we can have that 
yeah 
yeah but uh 
yeah 
yeah maybe yeah yeah 
if we do some more research maybe we 
hmm yeah i think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah 
yeah yeah of course yeah 
mm-hmm 
thank you 
yeah i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be right with you 
okay 
okay you want me to start right now 
okay 
well could you um put my slides up 'cause i think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time 
i'm participant four i believe 
yes uh-huh 
'kay 
there we go 
okay well i think we have introduced ourselves so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide 
cause that's where m my discussion starts 
right well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it 
um i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody 
and th the reason i just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions 
you know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car 
it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your c. d. whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility 
so i'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time 
if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do 
so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another 
and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those 
so that was um what i meant there 
and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money 
because if we're gonna sell this thing i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present 
twenty five euros makes a nice little present and we want it to be an impulse purchase 
we want somebody to see it and think it's gee i just gotta have that 
and take out their wallet and buy it 
so it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by september 
'cause anything that you don't already have out there in september showing it around isn't gonna sell for christmas 
um and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and i'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view 
so i'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you 
and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know 
what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle 
a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever 
okay can we go to the next slide please 
alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible 
so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything 
i'd like the suggestions to be really specific so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off 
not something like you know whole house control what'll be and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible 
at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at we should be able to make it work the t. v. the v. c. r. 
the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp 
i have to wind up 
yeah sure 
okay 
okay 
of course yeah 
okay so that's something 
okay so 
okay 
alright thanks for that 
um alright now other things that i found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now 
'cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use 
and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room 
um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address 
uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use 
and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep 
and i think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate 
'kay can we go to the next slide please 
okay so my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle 
that is the selling point the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase 
uh because once there's no be back well in sales they always say you know be backs don't come back 
if somebody says oh i'll come back and get it next week you're dead 
they're never gonna come back and buy it 
you've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing 
and in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use 
we have to have as few buttons as possible because more buttons is more confusion so that's why i'm saying simplicity is good 
finding it's important obviously you can't use it if you can't find it 
so we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it and i've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here 
it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros 
so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say uh twenty five euros i'm not gonna take that 
has to be so great that they're gonna say uh twenty five euros isn't much 
um and then maybe a motto like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign 
okay that's uh about it for me right now 
okay 
mm-hmm 
signal 
mm-hmm 
yeah well that's already been eliminated by management so we're off the hook 
mm okay 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
well we already eliminated that 
now that's good from a marketing point of view the fun the fun shape 
and that you you say that won't add too much to the budget 
to d the shape is uh 
do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes 
is that gonna be a possible 
'cause that might help with the marketing 
because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is 
mm 
well 
i think i think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the user interface person because i think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature 
because i think one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one 
the changing modes was something i mean you and i all f all four of us we work with computers all the time 
changing modes is nothing for us but people who 
n and 
and that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel and um you don't feel the mode change 
so um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too 
you know like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it 
but we'll get to that with you 
that's right yeah 
now that's a good point 
yeah 
yeah that's that's a good that's a good one because the clock would be really friendly and and when is your favourite show coming on and 
yeah and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen 
and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute 
yeah that's that's good the clock is good 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
case 
so it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there 
or 
okay 
okay 
so it might be helpful if we had a look at that 
okay thank you 
could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up betsy 
yeah okay thank you 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 'kay 
and an alarm clock yeah that should that should be okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
well you know there's the old motto children under six never shop alone 
so if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull 
mm-hmm 
that's right 
you can make a banana shaped one 
mm-hmm 
respect 
mm 
what about the electronics 
that's not really gonna change much is it 
that that w that won't change much will it uh 
i d i wouldn't think so 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
that's right and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone 
or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes 
um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case 
and in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it 
um you as an industrial person 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
well there's a real idea yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
right 
mm-hmm 
uh yeah 
an alternate package 
yeah 
okay 
well i think we can only aff yeah 
cosmetic 
warning finish meeting now 
well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um 
mm-hmm 
okay but we have to l 
okay fair enough 
okay 
okay 
hello everyone 
um how uh how we doing 
uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting more or less 
um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working meaning gathering i suggestions 
from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given 
uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use 
um it's also an item that people lose a lot 
so we should address that 
and of course it should be something 
s s that is very simple to use 
in addition to that to make it sell of course uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive 
or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another 
so that the people are buying it now because in particular with smaller items 
that's a very important fact 'cause um if they say well i go home and think about it that won't work 
um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve 
and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan 
our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip 
that has infra red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip 
therefore messages uh will be controlled in the same manner 
there should be extra features like lid buttons maybe a beep 
if too many buttons are pressed 
mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um 
you could see the time you know what show they want to watch 
also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes 
so the components of the thing should be button bulbs infra infra red bulbs battery chips wires and maybe some kind of a holder 
uh for the for the uh item 
francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it 
of course should have an on off button and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock 
particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable 
it should be compact 
her personal favourite was it should be t shaped 
and maybe have an anar alarm clock 
and the material should possibly be not of non allergic nature 
uh the different systems uh that exist are infra red or radio waves 
uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature 
and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote 
uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time 
okay 
okay then we i'm looking for three presentations 
and uh i don't know whether the order matters much uh i don't i don't think so so whoever w wants yeah okay 
okay your slides 
okay 
oh come on close already 
and that's number two right 
three 
okay 
nine what 
nine channel uh switches 
nine channel switches 
is yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
right 
mm-hmm 
okay thank you very much 
uh any comments on uh her presentation 
yeah i i th i think 
no i think the these are her presentations 
but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if i just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation 
mm right 
mm-hmm 
ho who wants to go next um 
mm-hmm 
okay and you 
uh okay 
oops 
the components design 
mm-hmm 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
go away 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
and you have more pictures 
uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting 
okay well thank you 
any particular comments by anybody 
we don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present her her thing 
uh okay 
okay 
uh that 
concludes the presentation of everyone 
and what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote 
and uh so what do we think on the concept 
of the remote 
y 
okay 
mm-hmm 
i think that's 
mm-hmm 
well you you teach you have to teach uh 
okay before we get too far off here um the components of the concept is the energy 
what kind of energy do we foresee 
battery 
battery 
okay then chip on print 
okay 
and the case 
and i think we all agree on the case we wanna have something uh maybe bright colourful 
mm-hmm 
trendy design compact and strong 
user interface concept uh interface type supplements 
that will be your area i think right jana 
put uh k i guess uh for yeah 
and 
not sure what they mean by supplements 
oh like 
oh 
a what 
right right right mm-hmm 
right 
okay 
uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes 
and the uh i. d. is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then to have the look and feel design 
and uh the u. i. d. is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design 
and the marketing expert with the product evaluation 
in this phase the two of you jana and francine have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay it says here 
you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches 
um if you have any questions you know you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach i suppose 
um so um i think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes according to our timetable here 
thank you very much 
hi 
mm-hmm 
interface designer 
yes 
yes 
okay i can start first 
okay 
now my slide please 
three 
participant three 
yes 
okay 
now as an interface designer i would give more emphasis on the interface 
how the remote looks like so that it is sellable it is attractive to customers 
next please 
okay 
now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television 
this messages could be uh switch on off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel 
like you can have the numbers one two three four up to nine 
pardon me 
yes nine numbers 
and then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa 
then it should have a next button and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one 
next slide please 
then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume 
then there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television 
for example if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english 
then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen 
then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour 
colour of the picture the contrast sharpness brightness of the picture 
now there should be a memory switch 
there should be a mute button 
suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh t. v. 
but he he can reduce the sound he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the t. v. 
now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature 
it's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit 
so a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers you can record your own voice 
which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television for example 
if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel 
uh th now the the uh yeah the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel 
so the t. v. will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities 
so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have 
so this is one one of the interface which can be created 
a very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features 
then please next slide 
then these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour but they have many buttons 
so uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that 
so you can you can design an interface which is very simple and which is user friendly 
even a kid can use that 
so can you go on t t uh to the next slide 
yeah so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser 
and this has multi purpose use it can be used for t. v. it can be used for cable satellite it can be used for v. c. r. d. v. d. s and audio 
and this has in built voice recogniser 
can you go on to the next slide 
yeah now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use 
uh this is user friendly it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it 
and this comes with different colours different shapes 
and this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small compact 
attractive child interface 
next slide please 
now this is a big over sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace 
this 
so this is no this is a very big you cannot misplace it anywhere 
so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose 
this i this is one such interface which can be created 
and the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function 
thank you that's 
mm yes 
okay 
okay 
we can 
it works 
mm yes 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
transmit 
okay 
okay 
push buttons 
'kay 
mm-hmm 
uh yes i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser 
this could be uh one feature which could be sellable 
mm-hmm 
no it's it's uh yeah it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already 
and then you're expecting an answer from th for example you have a t. v. system 
i'm the user and my family members are the user i will already record uh a question like 
uh good morning like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television 
so i'll say just good morning and the t. v. will switch on 
it will recognise my voice and will switch on 
battery 
yes 
yes 
and compact 
trendy design and compact 
yes 
push buttons 
and 
supplements like different types of features buttons like can have a f mute button or a swapping button 
recogniser 
yes 
yes 
okay 
okay 
okay 
thank you 
hi 
yeah good 
hmm 
yeah 
going to the nex next 
mm 
mm-hmm 
yeah maybe 
participant two 
uh the next one sorry 
it's it was the old one 
components 
um this time i'm i'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design 
uh can you go on to the next slide please 
i have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction 
uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit battery etcetera etcetera it's like 
uh it can be a plastic one hard plastic so that it can be strong 
even if you just uh uh you know if you if it falls down then it doesn't break 
so it should be strong 
and uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that 
and it should be recyclable 
uh and uh yeah and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours 
blue red green so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components 
and uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit 
uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller 
if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one 
and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures 
suppose if it is thirty eight degrees outside forty degrees outside 
it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures 
and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility 
and the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m i think it's it's like a battery 
capacitor 
can you go on to the next slide please 
uh a diode a transistor a resonator 
these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller 
a battery uh i would like to suggest one thing uh if we 
uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery 
even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much 
it it it's not a high voltage battery 
then also we can if it is a rechargeable one then uh people can use it for a long time 
so in that way we can cut cut the cost but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one 
and we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller 
can you go to the next slide please 
and how it works how the remote controller works 
when you press a button 
thank you 
uh when you press a button when you do that 
you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button 
and it will send some signals through the wires and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed 
suppose you have pressed channel one button number one you have pressed then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed 
it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button 
every button every individual button has its own morse code 
suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button 
and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l. e. d. which translates the signal into infrared light 
like you have got a signal by pressing a button 
that's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit 
now that signal that morse code has to be amplified by the transistor 
that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller 
it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l. e. d. and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits 
the sensor on the t. v. can see the infrared light and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately 
that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do 
then it will do the appropriate action 
so uh this is how the remote controller works 
can you go to the next slide please 
yeah i have few pictures 
when you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller 
and to the next slide please 
and where we had a a few buttons and all 
and uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components 
like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins 
and also a capac uh a capacitor three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah and di and a diode transistor 
the electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an 
yeah di um can y uh you can see the t. a. double one eight three five labelled uh chip um 
uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors 
and uh just beside that you can see a transistor and a uh uh cylinder shape uh that one is a capacitor 
uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry ther there is a diode 
can you go go on to the next slide 
so uh this is the circuit board 
the green one is a circuit board 
actually uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive 
uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper 
because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires 
it's it's better to go for printing because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing 
nothing like uh you know you don't need to use wires and all 
it's not exactly wires we are using 
it's just printing something on a board 
tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits 
so th that green uh thing is a circuit board 
and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons like when you press a button 
the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the 
yeah um integrated circuit 
can you go to the next slide please 
uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons 
uh can you see the black uh round marks 
they they are the circuits 
next please 
and um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls 
uh b but a b a push button requires a simple chip underneath it but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range 
like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip 
uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery a more ingenious uh hard dynamo 
um a kinetic provision of energy more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy 
so that also we can have in a battery uh or we can use solar sells 
uh 
yeah 
uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases 
uh usually the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller 
um 
yeah 
yeah maybe d uh i have just one more slide i think 
um 
like we can have a ma material such as plastic rubber wood titanium but titanium we can't use 
um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print 
um also infra it includes the infrared se sender 
um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker 
an yeah that's it 
it's all for me now thank you 
no no no th the the the scrolling wheels are different like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls 
uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before i think 
now nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all 
so i think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons 
yeah uh yeah push buttons 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah but w 
yeah 
yeah but but i what i'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work 
because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems issues 
yeah it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice 
like maybe different people will be having different voices so it like it's uh everything so i 
so to get a good recogni recognising system it's a costly thing i think 
mm-hmm 
yeah but yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
and also strong 
trendy yeah 
uh 
um like the switches like we use buttons for user interface 
push buttons 
yeah 
mm yeah 
hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
thank you 
hi 
yeah i think that pretty much is it 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
you don't know me 
i could lose that in a minute 
well um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there 
um what uh i'm no suggestion's bad 
but uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more 
i don't think that we can get uh the t shape is good the child one is good the too big to misplace i think it's just funny 
um i don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter 
it's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy 
yeah mm 
mm-hmm 
have to come back to that later 
okay 
no i think her presentation was good and she really explored all the options 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
good point 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yes 
yes 
okay 
hmm that's interesting 
uh yeah on the scroll and the push button um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button 
mm-hmm 
um 
we'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost 
okay 
okay 
go right to my first my next slide 
um alright my method is uh i'm interested in what the competition is doing and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition 
so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers 
i s i spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing 
and then when i'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that 
i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have and if it's convenient in the conversation i ask about it 
and i would encourage you all to do the same 
um and my findings from this is that you know small is beautiful 
um people like something that really fits in their hand 
simple is beautiful 
they don't want to have to squint at small print um they want buttons whose functions are obvious 
and they want um as few buttons as possible and they don't care for the mode thing 
they want each button to do something 
and eye catching is important 
it's gotta look cute it's gotta look appealing 
go ahead i'm trying to finish fast for you 
um and our preference is as far as i'm concerned are we got to get to the market before the competition 
ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others 
so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item 
and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign 
if we try to tell people it has too many great features um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere 
so we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things i think that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product 
and i've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular 
and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular 
and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal 
they are more back into soft feel spongy feeling things things with maybe a little cloth on them 
so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item 
mm-hmm 
you wanna try to come back to yours and limit yours a bit 
okay 
so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned 
yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature 
that that be really good yeah i agree with that 
distance problem 
uh 
i think i think battery and i think we all agreed on that 
that that's that's gonna be most cost effective and the best thing 
yep 
bright colourful trendy trendy design and strong 
mm-hmm 
well i think that 
yeah or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement 
her speech recognition feature would be a supplement 
okay so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is 
okay 
wherever they're hiding 
well hi everyone again 
um like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go 
uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um 
designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the t. v. 
it should have nine channel buttons a next button volume buttons subtitle buttons switch to control features colour contrast sharpness etcetera 
it should have a memory switch a mute button in case the telephone rings or something 
uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote 
um 
should be child friendly design with few buttons colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons 
um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose 
um 
that's right 
but uh her very f personal favourite really she she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote 
the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue 
she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong not using any harmful materials should be recyclable and should be colourful 
should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant 
she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated 
uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor diode transistor resonator and if possible a rechargeable battery 
uh and of course a circuit board 
and how it would works you press the button 
the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider 
she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip 
uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore 
should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases 
the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition 
has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small 
easy to use and it should be eye catching 
from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does 
to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on 
too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter 
so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home 
um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel 
she feels that's really what people want today 
and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser 
the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip should be trendy design compact and strong and should have buttons 
and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting 
now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm mm-hmm 
mm-hmm mm-hmm 
what kind of button 
menu 
uh menu th menu uh one one 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yes the buttons are all raised right 
are raised mm-hmm 
right 
or have two hands to operate it yeah 
yes and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah mm-hmm 
so if you're left handed or right handed it doesn't matter 
well i have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons 
like that people know or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what 
will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it 
yeah 
but anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols text or something so that people kn 
that's right 
okay yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm 
right mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
right 
now what what are our special features for the marketing 
that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual 
and then and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use 
you know 
colours 
mm-hmm 
cutest 
yeah 
okay now uh having said that 
no now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done 
now we're gonna talk about financing 
well there is a production evaluation 
is that you 
but that's after the financing 
see 
fi see 
um 
okay we had looks and voice recognition 
okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is 
okay uh energy source we say that's battery right 
okay now 
so we i guess we use one 
what 
t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected 
well that's nice 
she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would 
it doesn't work 
hmm 
oh okay yeah okay let's see 
okay one okay 
oh go away 
um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need 
uh electronics simple chip on print 
is that's what we're using 
one of those 
come on 
okay one 
uh regular chip on print 
no 
that's all we need the one case uncurved flat single curved double curved 
double curved 
one of those 
case materi s supplements 
plastic we said right 
uh wood rubber 
uh but yes but 
that's just for the case material so special colours though we having that right 
and then we have to interface push buttons 
scroll wheel no 
integrated scroll wheel l. c. display 
button 
no 
uh button supplement special colour 
special form 
and special material rubber wood yes 
okay 
total seven point six whatever that means 
that's the price 
mm 
eight eight point two 
that's hmm 
eight point two right 
so we looks like we are 
well within budget 
okay 
i guess i should save this i suppose huh 
oops 
uh-huh huh-huh 
i just tried that 
my documents computer 
my compu ah oh here it is yes 
okay fine 
save 
okay good so that's the good news 
we gonna be popular 
um 
so that uh i think financing was pretty simple 
now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation 
you wanna go to the next slide 
okay 
um i just realised one thing 
in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser 
and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that too 
eight eight twenty yes 
i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty 
but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished 
as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much 
so um we just have to beware of that 
i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that 
yeah 
i'm sorry to interrupt then but i just uh recog i just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features 
okay 
so to beware of that 
you wanna go to this next slide marketing expert 
i dunno 
yes it is 
mm-hmm 
oh 
why 
wh why you need that up 
i think you can make it there 
yes i think uh shape is one 
you you gave it a four 
um i dunno 
i think i would give it at least a two 
colour uh i 
one 
i i like the colours 
one 
uh i think i would give it a two 
well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um 
i'll give it a three 
uh 
here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity 
um 
is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy 
y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't 
with this particular item we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things 
uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money wise for the voice recogniser 
um 
so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process 
uh um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created 
uh i think personally i think uh i'm pretty happy 
um an 
and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project 
uh 
and i think team work i think was very very good i think we really yeah 
mm-hmm 
and uh i think we are we happy with the means we used 
we used whiteboard we didn't use digital p well digital pens i guess are these things 
yes we could 
uh 
it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and i think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit 
yes i think so i think absolutely and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier 
um did we new did we find new ideas 
i think we did 
i think we we did uh in more than one respect and uh so i think we did very well here 
are the costs within budget 
yes yes 
uh is the project evaluated 
yes 
um then celebration 
so i i thank you all very much 
um i think this was very good and um 
i think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible 
feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view 
so thank you 
i always get it on here but getting it off is 
ah yes we have time later but we don't 
hello 
designer 
yes 
yeah 
just the look like the button part i'll explain 
okay 
now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote 
now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or l. e. d. the infrared 
now uh we have included the switch on and off button 
now we have included another feature that is the mute button 
on the side of the model 
then we have included one to nine buttons 
for controlling the programmes the different channels 
we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume 
and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels 
now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button 
menu button 
yes menu 
at the centre 
we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour sharpness brightness 
of this uh picture 
we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button 
now this is uh a special special feature which we have included 
now this button 
is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel 
if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel 
it will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a 
swapping button 
no 
swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap 
this button 
yes 
and at the end it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly 
so this is our proposed model 
now the marketing expert has to 
give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective 
yes yes 
yes 
mm 
abs okay 
no these the front buttons which are here are the mute buttons 
yes yes 
yes 
pardon me 
this is the menu yes yes 
a the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels 
scroll up or scroll down the channels 
yes it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols 
yes which can be easily recognised 
yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
and 
and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape 
a shell shape 
yes yes 
yes snail shell 
yes 
mm-hmm 
y yes 
yes 
yes 
yes 
single curve 
mm 
plastic 
is this for the case 
yes 
yes 
yes 
no 
speci 
yes 
yes d we do have special form 
one two three four five six seven eight nine 
nine points okay yes 
okay 
on the desktop 
okay 
fee selling 
yes 
okay 
okay 
yes 
yes yes 
yeah mm 
worse okay 
one 
one 
one 
yes 
i'll give three 
two 
we can always improve yes 
yes features 
yes 
voices 
yes 
yes 
and maybe 
yes yes you've done a good job 
whiteboard more yes yes 
yes 
no 
yes 
cel celebration yes yes 
thank you 
okay 
they say it's forty minutes 
okay 
hello 
yeah 
yeah 
uh so this is our what uh we have made 
this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build 
uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks wise it is beautiful 
uh and also compact in shape 
uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily 
yeah oops sorry 
um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the 
um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah 
yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it 
and then um uh for the for the led 
for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared 
and and the button button's part uh will be explained by f francina 
tell yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
hmm 
mm-hmm 
ah 
yeah definitely 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah of course and also 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah we can 
text 
text that we can have on the case itself we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons 
yeah 
yeah 
so it is yeah yeah shell 
mm-hmm 
mm 
yeah of course yeah 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah yeah 
no 
yeah 
this is a 
yeah 
yeah 
i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
uh i think that's the price 
maybe it is it just n 
yeah 
ami 
ami should for 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
eight twenty so 
we have um four euros yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
yeah still 
yeah 
included yeah 
hmm-hmm 
yeah even my yeah shape is one 
yeah even i think it is one 
it's quite small 
yeah one 
uh maybe two yeah 
uh three mm-hmm 
yeah 
maybe we can 
yeah include some more buttons and uh um yeah features 
we can make the buttons few buttons smaller 
uh i think they are quite big so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case 
if we want to have more features than that 
yeah 
yeah definitely 
mm-hmm 
yeah definitely yeah two mu mute buttons 
hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
even i'm happy 
yeah 
yeah yeah definitely 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah probably 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah many 
yeah 
ah 
yeah 
yeah 
thank you very much 
do we do we have some time left 
uh you have 
oh alright 
hello 
mm-hmm 
and she was challenged on that point 
okay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
good 
you used to have all the buttons 
oh that's good no that's nice and friendly 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
yeah okay mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 
menu button 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
of the screen 
mm mm-hmm 
the next channel in the numeric pattern or 
yeah mm-hmm 
mm 
okay okay 
okay 
mm-hmm 
okay well um 
what what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb 
that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand yeah 
the buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around 
turn it upside down move it up up and down i really like that 
you really did a good job on that my little designers 
um and um i like the idea that the on off button is in a really prominent place 
that's that's a really good good thing 
yeah that's great 
mm-hmm 
the colour's very attractive 
um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute 
and these mm-hmm 
on both sides they're mute 
so you can push either one 
okay 
and this brings the menu up on the screen 
this brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are 
okay 
f f okay 
right very good 
uh it looks mm looks like something i can sell 
okay and now i'm supposed to yeah 
yeah 
good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent 
symbols on it 
mm-hmm mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm 'kay mm 
mm-hmm 
for the snail yeah mm-hmm we have the snail shell 
he goes right back into his shell 
well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would 
that would really work 
so 
i think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range 
yep uh well i think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical 
i think we have to we have to dwell on on on the appearance 
we're really gonna have the be the 
cutest remote control on the block 
so i think we have to play with the image play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition 
i think those are the two things to push 
the look 
and the voice recognition 
they're gonna be our two selling points 
i'm supposed to make a little presentation aren't i 
okay 
ah but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something 
no 
yeah that's me 
oh okay 
sorry sorry 
mm mm 
that's right 
can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes 
or 
well 
i guess it's double curved 
mm-hmm 
rubber because we're gonna have the soft buttons 
oh okay the mm-hmm mm' kay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
no 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all right 
mm-hmm 
yes 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay i'll take my file down so you can bring it up 
'kay should be able to get it now 
'kay why don't you move just to the next slide right away 
yeah right away 
okay well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question will it sell 
and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of 
we can't accept every suggestion of course but maybe we just need to get a few 
and show the the prototype to consumer research groups 
we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any 
so we have to get some input from those people 
and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it 
we think it's good we're gonna get behind it and sell it 
um next slide please 
okay now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype 
i wanted the shape to be biomorphic i didn't want anything with angles and all square 
i wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that 
the size is small the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted 
we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped 
even though it's gonna be hard plastic it feels good in your hand so that's nice 
and functionality i put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it 
so paradoxically the other features in other words the look the feel um and the shape that's what people are gonna get in the store 
they don't have a television in the store they can't play with it 
um so they'll be our main selling points 
so um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please 
okay so um the shape um i think is a a one 
that's really really excellent shape 
the size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the for the marketing these aren't i in how i feel 
i think that it's i think that it's plenty small enough to sell but i think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven 
i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors 
and our colour i think is great 
the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there 
and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible 
and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality 
obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality 
so i think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it 
yes 
ah 
well um we had what eight eight euros twenty as our cost 
and so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend 
mm-hmm 
well um that's 
mm-hmm 
well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price the the the problem is quality 
so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us 
and um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway 
as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products 
uh well i isn't this my last slide 
maybe 
go ahead 
i think that was my last slide yeah 
um 
mm okay 
and i'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard 
um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now so if you put my last slide back up there 
i'm sorry i've um forgot to do that um 
hmm 
well because i can't remember what i put on there 
okay 
now i'm supposed to see how long my leash is here 
mm 'kay 
you ready 
so now we're all supposed to say what we think 
um okay so on shape 
i gave it a one 
wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst 
um what do you think the shape is 
one okay and be betsy 
okay uh-huh one okay 
and how about on size 
on size 
i gave it a four yeah i feel it's just average 
okay 
mm-hmm 
okay 
okay you're the designer of course you wanna give it a one 
um and then how about how we doing on colour 
colour i gave it a one 
i really like all those nice bright warm colours 
one 
one one one okay 
and how about the feel 
taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand 
okay i gave it a three two yeah 
three 
two okay 
and the next is functionality where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here but 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
okay 
two okay 
three 
okay 
well um 
it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product 
um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe heaven forbid having another meeting 
but um otherwise i think we're we're ready to go to go with this product 
anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate 
mm-hmm 
well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech 
so that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons instead of having two mute buttons 
and um then maybe we can do something with the um 
the volume control 
maybe we can put that all on one button 
um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that 
mm-hmm 
no 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
i'm pretty happy with it too yeah um it's something i think i can market 
yeah 
i think you've done a good job miss leader 
yeah i d i do too i think we worked well together as a team yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more yeah we didn't use that enough 
mm-hmm 
and we used the slide because it was better positioned 
mm i think that's true mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
i think we were we were very good yeah mm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
yes yes 
celebration 
today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
okay 
okay 
watch i i have my cord behind you here 
okay 
but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time whenever we felt we were finished 
it'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace 
oh there we go 
so uh good morning 
i see you all find your places 
is everybody sitting on the right place 
yeah 
i guess so 
so 
let's see 
first i will introduce myself 
i don't know if uh if everybody knows me so i'm bart hello 
hello 
bart 
hello 
hello 
bart 
welcome 
uh let's see 
uh let's start off um with a little presentation 
uh 
now first i'll tell you a little bit about the setting 
you can see there are a few cameras here 
they'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice 
uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those 
because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it 
so is there a project documents folder 
there are some notes in it already i see some documents 
uh i'll start with the presentation kick off 
is being modified by the administrator 
uh okay 
let's do it read only 
well i don't know if you've noticed but uh we're working for real reaction 
uh it's a company in uh electronics 
we put fashion in electronics uh we make it work uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself 
i'm bart the project manager so i'll direct you through the project 
this is our agenda 
uh we have our opening acquaintance tool training project plan description closing 
uh maybe i can sit down then i can take some notes or let's see 
maybe you can take the minutes once in a while 
i dunno it's not a lot of work but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down just write it down 
uh as you can see uh it's the opening aquaintance tool training 
aquaintance is a point we've done a bit 
um have you all seen the corporate website already 
yeah 
have you seen any flaws in it 
i think i found one 
no 
i can 
see if it works this way 
no it doesn't work here 
okay no problem 
but um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was real remote instead of real reaction 
real remote is not really the company we're we are but it's just a little fault 
um okay what are we going to do 
uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control 
it has to be original trendy and user friendly 
so these are uh the points why uh we also hired you 
we've got the marketing expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look 
and industrial designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original 
and we've got our user interface designer 
he's also uh 
that's about the new remote control 
uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through 
first is functional des uh design individual work meetings 
after the functional design then the conceptual design and the detailed design 
i had some role indications on here 
but i think you know it already by yourself 
the industrial designer is going to work on the working design uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design 
uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design user interface concept and user interface design 
and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation 
so that's a bit what you're going to do 
but that will be all worked out in uh other meetings 
then we've got our first tool training 
we are going to work with a lot of high tech tools here so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first 
as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board 
um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side 
here are some functions 
you can save 
n uh these functions we don't have anything to do with only undo you can undo a little 
uh piece of drawing 
a blank new document for each person 
uh select a pen eraser 
capture we don't have to do anything with 
uh then we've got our pen 
this pen 
it's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of 
you can also select the current colour and the line width 
but then first you have to select the pen function 
but we're going to work with it in a minute 
so okay 
uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there 
uh then 
a short thing about documents 
we've got our shared folder uh project project what was it 
project documents i think 
but all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already so it will be okay 
and these are available on the smart boards as well so if you have a document you wanna show just open it from the folder 
here is a simple tool bar 
it's what i just said it's save print move back or forward one page 
you can switch between the different drawings 
and then we're going to try out the white board 
so as you can see we g all going to draw a animal 
just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it 
mouse wasn't running away 
is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse 
no 
okay 
we're going to uh draw animal 
and uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics 
um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours and different line width 
uh there's i can start from now 
i will 
you can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child 
because if you hold it like this the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good 
another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow 
'cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up 
so we choose form of current colour uh i think grey is appropriate 
then the line width 
i think seven will be nice 
now you'll see my drawing capabilities 
these are not very much but uh 
uh see you have to do it real slow 
oh 
ah i was trying to draw a dolphin but i think his nose has to be a little bit but it's close 
so what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish 
yeah he hasn't got an eye 
woah 
now we've got another function 
we've got the eraser 
and then you can undo 
this easily 
ah it's okay 
and i've got to write down a few of its characteristics 
uh is 
they've got no text tool no 
uh 
okay 
this is typically a undo action i think 
pen 
maybe you have to hold it a bit 
upside down 
i think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe 
but i don't know i'm just trying 
this is not my work okay 
maybe you have to use 
oh 
uh 
i think it's a it wants to draw a another animal 
i don't know 
it lives for the fun 
so 
it's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin 
it lives for the fun 
so now i'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you 
go ahead 
maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width i think 
because this is going a lot better than uh i did 
it's nice 
uh 
it's a real dead sheep yeah 
for recognition yeah i see 
um maybe you can also write your name somewhere 
on just a 
yeah 
nice 
sweet 
yeah just a blank sheet 
no 
yeah it's pretty skinny cat 
is your cat or did you find him on the street 
ah 
okay 
that's pretty clear 
so everybody knows how to work with the white board now 
so if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board just ask and go ahead 
it's pretty uh easy 
'kay 
s haunted white board 
so we've got the tool uh introduction 
we 
move along to the project finance 
um as you can see we um for our remote control a selling price is uh twenty five euros 
our selling price 
uh our profit aim is fifty million euros 
uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls so we have to work together to reach our aims 
uh we can do it international so we have to focus on different kind of users different kind of cultures and different kind of trends as well 
um but that's all in the later stadium 
our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros 
so that's also a point we have to keep in mind that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside and stuff like that 
it won't work 
so just try to remember these points 
selling price twenty five profit aims fifty million um but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on 
and production cost uh maximal twelve and a half euros 
so that's leads us to our little discussion 
we've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion 
so i'm gonna sit down i think 
it's easier 
i've got a message 
five minutes 
okay that's uh good timing 
uh maybe you have to say the magic word 
does it do anything 
maybe you have to just clap it down 
mm back up again 
no slide show 
hmm 
it's off 
now you have to put it back o oh yeah 
you'll be okay i think 
well it's those laptops 
nice 
okay 
but so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls and i mean not the ordinary mote controls but also a little bit different ones 
like you can use for other 
no 
you 
ah yeah 
yep 
yeah i've i've got one at home 
and you can uh program i think eight different devices in it and you can use it for your television anything else 
and it also operates on infra red so you have to got the little device inside your room 
and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor 
so that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d. v. d. player downstairs and you've got a link to your t. v. on the second floor 
so that's a pretty handy um 
thing 
um but only the 
i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control it makes it a lot easier as well 
it's uh 
that's good to remember 
yeah that's nice i think 
so we've we want different functions 
uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra red 
but i don't know if that will exceed the production costs 
so that uh that's something we have to find out i think 
and other functions for a remote control 
maybe we can make it uh uh 
shock proof 
sure 
waterproof 
okay 
so these are our um a few things we can think of 
um i will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder 
that's a battery stays 
yeah 
uh 
that's an idea as well 
other ideas 
quick ideas 
okay 
any questions about this uh presentation 
kick off presentation 
no 
okay then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder 
and then we can all work 
finish meeting now 
okay 
and we can all work uh on our own projects 
okay then i'll meet you in about a half an hour i think 
so good luck 
morning 
i'm 
yep 
hmm 
okay 
yeah 
yep 
hmm

okay 
this is my um hmm 
sheep 
with of course 
little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts

yeah 
'kay 
they are 
come on 
you have to go really slow when you're writing 
they're brilliant animal animals 
and that's just a little me thingy 
so 
guess i'll pass the pen to our user interface designer 
interesting 
a rabbit 
garfield 
yeah 
yeah 
and the most interesting tail 
yeah 
we're being haunted 
yeah you got a message 
so just on a side note why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen

ah there we are 
well we have a 
kind of broad t. v. at home and a d. v. d. player so we got like a lot of remote controls 
one for the t. v. one for the video recorder one for the d. v. d. player 
and i think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all 
oh really 
yeah 
yeah 
so i think you can take minutes again 
since it's your job 
yeah 
yeah 
but that would be really good if we could do that 
um 
think it has to be shock proof 
'cause 
my remote control tends to fall a lot 
so 
yeah one other little thing 
thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it 
so you can see 
how much is left in the battery 
but they'll also really drag up the production costs so think we'll have to see about that too 
but maybe just a little led i don't know 
um 
nope don't think so 
okay 
aye sir 
half an hour 
okay 
okay 
everybody found his place again 
yeah 
that's nice 
okay so this is our second meeting 
and uh still failing 
uh now we're going um into the functional design 
um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements technical function design and the working design 
so that we can move onto the second uh phase 
but first this phase 
um first an announcement 
there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system 
so 
there's our ghost mouse again 
that that means that you can have a little trouble with little trouble with the air conditioning that's because of this uh 
it's in wing c. and e. 
so it should be over in a in a while couple of days 
but it's going to be cold anyway so i don't think you're gonna need it 
then our agenda 
now first the opening 
uh this time i will take the minutes 
uh you're going to have a presentation 
all of you 
um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations 
so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation 
and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me 
and then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include 
so we've got forty minutes for all of it 
so i suggest um let's start with the first presentation 
um who wants to be first 
okay 
so 
just maybe it's easier if you um yeah i think you will tell your presentation as well 
just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about 
okay 
thank you 
so anybody have um any questions until now 
about functional requirements 
okay that's clear 
now to the second 
yeah 
yeah you can take your time 
we've got uh plenty of time so 
yeah 
there it is 
yeah 
one remote 
hmm 
'kay 
yeah 
okay 
anybody has questions about the technical functions 
yeah 
touchscreen 
huh 
'kay 
that's nice 
uh 
yeah 
that's right 
uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation 
uh and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design 
i think it's going to uh it's not too much 
okay 
okay 
thank you 
okay 
uh 
okay now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now 
um i'm the project manager so i'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements 
um that's we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for t. v. 
um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big if we wanna have it uh for more functions 
so it has to be simple 
uh another point is we have to skip the teletext 
because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past 
and uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control 
um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use 
uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well 
another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus 
uh that's the the market we have to to to target because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers 
um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert 
because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons 
so we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our 
uh remote control and the other way round 
and we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product 
so it has to be visible in our design in the way our device works 
and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well 
so i suggest 
let's have a discussion on the control functions 
yeah 
uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product 
um 
against the no teletext 
um 
yeah it's it is 
standard remote 
no i think we can 
i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned 
uh if we put a lot of effort in those we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons 
or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market 
and um if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus 
fifty plus it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now 
no 
but don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market 
that people think the people think that's the the device i've looked for although i didn't realise it 
so let's try it 
yeah 
yeah 
it's a big success 
very big success 
yeah 
uh 
i think so as well 
uh i simply think um 
uh that the new products we are gonna make uh spef specifically design 
are designed for uh younger people uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people 
and i think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls 
'cause what you told is the channel selection is important 
volume selection power and teletext 
okay 
um 
no we we haven't voted yet so uh i think teletext can be uh 
um can be a function as well 
but only if uh if it won't 
higher the the cost 
because i don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well but i don't think it will be a problem 
or is teletext a 
yeah 
yeah 
so i suggest uh 
yeah 
is anybody um really against teletext 
no 
just that that we just keep the teletext 
i think that's a good idea as well especially for the subtitles 
maybe we can 
make that um 
another point of advantage in our remote control 
if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles which is instantly on the remote control 
for elderly people they can think oh i wanna have subtitles and they push the button and they get the big subtitles 
um so i think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage 
um 
functionality should be few buttons you said 
i think uh that's very important we have a few buttons 
so to keep it simple 
no 
yeah 
but do you need 
but do you need the buttons for one to zero 
maybe c we can 
maybe we can use uh 
no maybe we can implement the scroll button 
or a joystick like 
there are other ways too 
just look if you look at telephones 
the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or 
that's right 
the numbers yeah 
yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it 
but i think there won't be very much buttons 
or there don't have to be a lot 
the number of buttons 
i think it's very important in the in the design 
you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places 
and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with 
to operate only the t. v. yeah 
no 
so 
'kay 
so we can 
yeah 
that's right 
yeah 
so you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station 
uh uh like other functions 
instead of f of less buttons 
mm 
no 
do you think the docking station will 
uh is allowed in the budget we have 
'cause it can be 
no 
yeah 
because i think that's uh 
that's a good advantage point as well 
if we have a fancy looking docking station or very that's a nice requirement 
docking station 
i think so 
yeah 
that's a good point 
um 
you said they easily get lost as well 
yeah 
so maybe we should implement the audio sign or something 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so audio signal should be possible as well 
i think it's not too expensive 
uh another 
point is the l. c. d. screen 
um i don't know if that will rise the cost too much because 
yeah 
it will be too much as well 
yeah 
based 
just the l. c. d. 
oh just the normal screen 
that's a good idea 
so some extra info 
feedback 
yeah 
i think that's a good idea as well 
as the small screen 
extra button info 
i think that should be possible as well 
um let's see what did we say 
mm 
more 
should be fancy to fancy design easy to learn 
few buttons we talked about that 
docking station l. c. d. 
um general functions 
yeah 
'kay 
and default materials 
i think that's a good idea as well because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one 
so that doesn't really matter 
so i think we nee 
uh let's um specify the target group 
because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty 
because i think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty maybe 
uh what do we want 
if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people we can 
target the real elderly people 
yeah 
so that's the 
now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example 
yeah 
sixty 
okay 
and different cultures 
are we 
okay 
no 
we've got five minutes left just now 
small warning 
should 
yeah 
in different languages you know 
yeah 
or you have to put a language button in it but that will be a bit unnecessary i think 
it's better to put it on different markets with it all 
okay 
so that's the the target 
uh then a few small things 
uh okay 
i will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder 
um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept 
user interface designer the user interface concept and the trend watching 
so just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group uh requirements and the trends which are uh going on 
and uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach 
so um i thank you for this meeting 
and i think we have a lunch break now 
so that's a good thing 
okay 
mm 
mm-hmm 
uh okay 
um i've been looking at uh the user interface of it 
um f for the techno f functions uh of of it 
um 
okay 
mm 
oh 
uh 
okay 
um yeah 
i think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control 
uh uh i've do i've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it um about uh interface but uh uh 
yeah i i've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control 
uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh d. v. d. uh uh television uh stereo 
so um 
but uh it must be uh user friendly 
so um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh yeah 
uh uh uh yeah 
in one um remote control 
but um 
yeah 
um yeah 
got uh many functions in one uh remote control um but um yeah you can see this is uh quite simple uh remote control 
um few uh buttons but uh this uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons 
um uh people uh don't like it uh so um 
well what uh i was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are 
so uh like uh the on off uh button 
uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button 
uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that 
um 
my personal uh preferences um 
use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device 
so um 
wh what i was th uh thinking about was um you've got um 
uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions 
uh like uh the on off button uh sound uh i dunno um and um here you've got a s kind of a display 
it's a touchscreen 
so um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a d. v. d. player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh 
and um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device 
so um this button is for a d. v. d. or so um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons 
so uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device 
so uh that's uh my uh idea about it 
um yeah and 
uh let's see 
uh yeah 
so a touchscreen 
uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um 
we better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah 
everybody uh have to use it so 
uh ol even even old people um young people 
so uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large 
so uh um 
yeah 
uh yeah 
that was uh my uh part of it 
so 
n i i don't think so 
uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen 
s um it's uh not uh in colour or something 
uh it's just uh um one colo uh yeah 
uh i seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago 
uh you got uh yeah quite an uh 
a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for 
uh twenty uh euros or uh less uh 
so it's possible 
yeah 
yeah that's true 
uh 
okay 
mm 
mm 
yeah 
mm 
forty 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
mm 
mm 
yeah 
but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles 
so it's yeah 
it's 
mm 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
if it's only for televi yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
so we can s we can skip the display so uh we don't need it 
uh 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
mm 
mm 
yeah 
hmm 
no 
no 
no 
hmm 
mm 
hm 
no 
mm 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
mm 
yeah 
mm 
mm 
no 
so 'kay 
yeah 
right 
no 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
no 
well i think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros 
but the it wouldn't be very robust 
it's very fragile and you can get scratches on it 
that's 
okay 
okay i've got a presentation about the working design 
um first about how it works 
it's really simple of course 
everybody knows how a remote works 
the user presses a button 
the remote determines what button it is uses the infrared to send a signal to the t. v. 
the t. v. switches to the frequency or what function it is 
so we've got um the the plate 
it gots conductive disks for every button 
when the user presses a button a signal got sent goes to the led and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t. v. 
it's a very simple device technically speaking 
so this is a schematic overview 
you've got the buttons 
the power source 
and uh when a button gets pressed its goes to the chip 
the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb 
when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button 
well um i think we should use default materials simple plastics 
keep the inner workings simple so it's robust 
uh i think we should focus on aesthetics the design and the user interface 
because if you're going to use high tech materials the price is going to go sky high 
and uh you only have to design a remote once and if you use high tech materials it come back in every product 
so it's in my idea it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself 
that's it 
i think that if we're if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i don't know if you've heard about it in the news 
the the elderly mobile phone 
yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind we could make tons of money i think 
we don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality 
we just 
change our focus on the project and i think 
we can uh we can sell this 
no 
uh that's a good idea 
yeah 
and besides that it's um if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt 
they're not used to using scroll buttons 
so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout 
it should be possible yes 
if it's not too fancy 
and if the remote stays rather small it should be possible yeah 
yes 
so we're just gonna focus on the extras 
yeah 
like with your key chain if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound 
yeah 
y i um i think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen 'cause 
it's uh 
well i don't think they have different television sets uh 
in uh every country 
'cause 
yeah 
yeah 
yes 
yeah 
okay 
no 
yes 
think i'll go first 
'kay 
my name is freek van ponnen 
i'm the market expert 
but you already knew that 
um i've done some research 
we have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls 
uh we let them fill out a questionnaire 
we had one hundred of these uh test subjects 
uh in addition we did some market research 
uh see what the market consists of 
what ages are involved 
well these are three quite astonishing results i thought 
um remotes are being considered ugly 
f uh seventy five percent of the um 
people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly 
um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy looking remote control 
so 
um in addition remotes were not very functional 
fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control 
and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room 
so 
some things 
then we did some research to the most relevant functions 
channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy 
the power button got a nine 
and teletext got a six and a half 
so these are the most 
most uh important functions on a remote control 
then there are some one time use function 
that's what i like to call them 
that uh audio settings video settings and channel settings buttons 
which are not really used very frequently but are still considered to be of some importance 
um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently 
one hundred and sixty eight times per hour 
then these are the this is the market 
um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six 
um 
main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control 
um they like to use new f new functions 
but they also are very critical 
they won't spend their money very easily 
so 
um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market 
they are not really very interested in features 
but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier 
um 
what i think this indicates for our um 
design 
i think we should make a remote for the future 
and this means we would 
um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five 
uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable 
um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design 
um 
the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r. s. r. s. i. 
um this is certainly something to take into account 
and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control remote control 
so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design 
besides of course that the remote must look very nice 
and the functionality 
as a lot of people indicated they only use about ten percent of the buttons i think we should make very few buttons 
uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote 
uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised 
especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons 
'cause they're used most and so they should be robust 
they shouldn't break down easily 
um 
then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room it might be 
and i say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot 
but it might be a good idea to make a docking station 
and this would could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep 
so you'd know where it is in the room 
and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in 
then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an l. c. d. screen in the remote control would be preferred 
this was um 
mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five 
but up till forty five it remains feasible 
this would also greatly increase the production costs but i think these are just some small factors we could consider 
that would be all 
any questions 
'kay 
yeah you should go to the top thingy 
slide show 
oh yeah 
hmm 
well it would certainly make a fancy design 
so 
that is true 
we would have to look into that 
yeah 
so is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement 
yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon 
and new t. v. s will have internet access on them 
but i think if you're targeting people of forty plus the chance that they will have a t. v. with internet access 
within the next like twenty years is very slim 
in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control 
so i think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it 
i'm pretty much against it 
yes 
besides that i think the market for forty plus is like 
pretty small 
but i mean if i s if i see this it's i think we're just gonna go for another 
pretty 
and not innovative 
remote control 
yes but it's not the biggest part of the 
market 
and besides that they're not very critical so i mean they don't really care 
what the remote control is like 
they'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable 
no 
i think that would be the case in the 
sixteen to forty five age category 
because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control 
people of forty plus i mean they want it to work but 
as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them 
so 
i haven't heard of it 
hmm 
yes 
yes 
but obviously the board tends to disagree 
yeah also 
i think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext 
yes 
mm-hmm 
but 
i don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause 
well might be 
but i mean it if it's only for t. v. you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway 
you need a one to zero button next channel previous channel 
volume up volume down and some teletext buttons but 
i think if you if you only l 
nah 
think if you're gonna include teletext you do 
i think many people like to use that 
'cause if you should if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times 
that's true but um 
i don't think there are many t. v. s that can switch channels that fast 
and so you would need like 
the t. v. would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it 
and i dunno if many channels would 
do have that 
if many t. v. s have that 
mm-hmm 
but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t. v. you there's not much you can gain on 
um having as few buttons as possible 
'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t. v. which already only have the minimum number of buttons 
i don't think there's much to be gained in that area 
yeah 
that is true but i think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the t. v. 
'cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a t. v. there's simply not a lot of buttons required 
there's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either 
so i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here 
that would that would cost a a big marketing 
expedition 
which was 
one of the arguments to make it only for the t. v. because we didn't have the time to market a lot 
maybe 
well 
yeah i think mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and 
but i don't think we should spend very much time in that 
yeah i think maybe we should do some research into 
what elderly people like to have in a 
like to have extra in a new remote control 
yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost 
yeah that was what i suggested 
you have it on yeah you have it's on some phones too which have a docking station 
and you just press a button and the phone goes ringing 
so you know where it is 
i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn 
and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices 
it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it which would explain a button if you press it 
which would tell you what it does 
and it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen but 
just a small screen with two 
yeah 
but i dunno if that would 
that would fit into the 
costs 
no 
i think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than 
youngsters 
yeah 
i think 
i think that would be a if we should do something like that it would be a 
i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company 
and i think i think there would be a good market for it 
if we're able to really bring an innovative product 
yeah the really 
but 
i'd have to look into that a little more 
'kay 
and with uh the little screen in it which explains the buttons 
you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to 
adapt it to different cultures 
yeah 
yeah 
'kay 
that's good 
okay 
uh good afternoon 
this is our third meeting already 
i hope you enjoyed your lunch 
i did anyway 
um let's see 
presentation three 
okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today 
it's the conceptual design meeting 
and a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components 
uh conceptual specification of design 
and also trend watching 
um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes 
um but first i'll show you the agenda 
uh first the opening 
then we have three presentations 
uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts 
how we're going to make it 
and then we're closing 
we have about forty minutes 
uh so i suggest let's get started 
uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation 
no 
everything fine 
that's nice 
then a little uh thing about the last meeting 
uh these are the points um we agreed on 
the requirements and the target market 
uh requirements are uh teletext docking station audio signal small screen with some extras that uh button information 
and we are going to use default materials 
um does somebody have any comments on these requirements 
maybe 
no 
these are just the the things we thought of so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else just let me know 
and maybe we can uh work it out 
and we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers 
so now everybody knows what we're do we're doing um i suggest let's get started with the presentations 
so shall we keep the same uh line up as uh last time 
okay 
good luck 
okay 
thank you 
any questions about the the trends 
mayb 
no 
okay we go on to the next one 
okay 
uh thank you 
okay 
thank you 
so that brings us to the discussion about our concepts 
mm 
'kay 
so these are the points we have to discuss 
um first 
i think we can talk about the energy source since that's um 
has a pretty big influence on production price uh and image 
uh so 
uh f i think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget i think 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
no 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
uh 
uh well i think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place 
and i don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms 
so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place 
and also what you said 
um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote 
but i think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station 
so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push and then it starts beeping 
and then we can we can still use the voice recognition but maybe then for only the the channels 
that's safe 
yeah 
that's a good point 
yeah sure 
go ahead 
no 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
easier to use 
no i think that's a good point 
yeah 
i personally think the l. c. d. screen we wanna use with the extra information i think nobody has anything against it 
because it's just uh some extra information and it's easy to ignore as well 
so if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it 
and um yeah i think the um maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition 
because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly 
and i don't think the i don't think it will be a lot easier to use as well 
so that brings us back to the energy 
if we don't have the voice recognition it will it won't use a lot of energy to use 
um 
so in that case we could use kinetic uh energy but i think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good 
and much cheaper as well 
so 
okay let me just choose for the battery 
that brings us to the chip 
just the advanced 
okay advanced chip 
and then we get to the point of the case 
um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well 
uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey 
or both 
um as we saw there is not yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce 
um but i think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive which they can show off to their grandkids 
look i've got a new remote control and uh 
yeah 
that's right 
but with colour was a lot more expensive 
or 
you don't know 
i think so because yeah 
it's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape 
yeah 
change the cases 
yeah 
you can sell the cases 
yeah 
i think that's a very good option 
because um then you can advertise as well with the give your grandfather a new case for his remote control or whatever 
because that's a it's something extra it's something other remotes don't have which we can get a great advantage point 
so and then you can make them with colour 
black and grey other colours as well 
costs 
yeah 
yeah 
so you suggest we should design two different telephones 
on which you can apply yeah remote controls on which you can apply different case covers for example 
remote 
yeah 
okay 
so everybody's okay with the changing covers 
i think that's a good uh good option 
changing case covers 
yeah 
mm 
okay 
uh but the form has to be um it has to 
it's has to be possible to stand up 
or just only to lie down 
and the the cover of the the docking station is also 
on top of the television then 
or not 
and you can just yeah then click it in 
that's okay 
um so the interface 
what type of interface do we want to use 
um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the 
on the the board 
does somebody have ideas for a form or 
yep 
mm 
usabili yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult and then it's 
but you have extra buttons 
so people can get confused 
especially if they have the same writings on it 
can't we make uh can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use 
on the same 
functions as the normal one 
then you have to 
let's see if i ca 
a blank one 
and then you get 
here's a little l. c. d. screen 
uh now i have to think 
it's a plus and a min 
no it's not very handy i think 
because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of 
no that's not gonna work 
i guess 
maybe we should yeah 
but is it a problem that left handed persons use a different hand 
i think the functions are 
that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or 
y yeah 
yeah 
i think we could just uh leave it a normal shape 
uh but maybe we have to 
make it a l a bit more fancy 
in one or ano another way 
yeah 
um yeah just 
yeah 
easier 
'kay 
i suggest um the single curved because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in 
uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen 
because it's a bit it has a bit of a angle 
yeah 
i think so 
yeah 
but now it's 
do you have it upside down or do you have it this that's top 
okay 
yeah 
so get your mouse 
yeah 
yeah 
that's a good one 
but i think it's better to put the screen uh on top 
so just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here 
if you can have this one you turn it like this 
and then flip it upside down 
because uh maybe your hand is in the way if you have the display here 
i think i 
on top 
yeah 
so then we get 
here's that's the curve 
here the display and then buttons 
yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe 
just that's for left hand and right hand users 
and then h the rest of the buttons over here 
yeah still here jus 
that's 
yeah 
should be more bit more friendly yeah 
'kay 
supplements 
that's okay 
where's my mouse 
then 
we've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use 
so now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look and feel design 
it's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote 
so check out the corporate website maybe 
the user interface design it's the same story 
and product evaluation 
so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one 
but you're going to get your instructions i think sended by the coach 
so just um i will put these um minutes on the in the folder 
and then we're going to uh try to finish our project and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers i think 
which are uh let's see 
i'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or i think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first 
and then you'll get a message 
so that's uh basically it 
maybe this one 
then we can save this one in the 
folders group 
uh yes it's here 
smartboard there it it 
so if you wanna have a look at it it's over there in the projects folder 
and then i guess we'll start in thirty minutes again 
thank you 
no 
mm no 
um 'kay um yeah 
uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface 
um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons 
so uh um uh that's w what i what i want to uh 
uh to do in uh our design 
so um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control 
um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition 
so maybe uh we can uh use uh that 
um 
uh and uh using a little uh display 
so um findings 
um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions 
so uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound um for uh on off um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down 
um uh let's see 
um yeah and 
uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it 
so uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles 
just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting 
um and yeah overall um user friendly 
so uh using uh large large buttons 
um 
it's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition 
um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal 
so uh uh yeah 
and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something 
you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or 
a and uh yeah 
television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh 
um 
let's see 
uh yeah 
i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles um just one button to keep it uh simple 
uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles 
um double push push um if double click um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles for uh people uh 
um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles 
so uh um 
yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use 
the on off sound on off sound higher or lower um the numbers uh zero to uh uh nine 
um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel 
um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons 
and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on 
so um made a little uh picture of uh it 
um 
see 
um yeah 
just um we can put uh the on off button uh over in this uh corner 
um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on off button on that place 
um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button 
so um 
d display uh of it it's uh just a small display 
uh um you can put it uh on top 
um it's uh most uh 
uh place where people uh most of looks at 
so uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel 
um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the 
so you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down 
um it's uh quite uh 
handy place 
so um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button uh for sound uh 
uh and uh for our design um uh we have to discuss about it uh i think uh so uh the form of it so 
and that's it 
mm 
nah 
but 
what's the function 
yeah f for loading up uh the batteries 
b b 
okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh i i believe 
uh it's uh just a small display so i believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more 
so i believe one battery uh is just enough 
uh so 
okay 
yeah 
that's true 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
uh 
mm 
mm 
'kay 
yeah 
but uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh l. c. d. sh uh display or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use 
okay 
yeah 
no 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
uh i dunno 
mm 
mm 
uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case 
so um uh you 'cause uh yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia mobile phones uh when you can change the case of it 
so 
maybe it's possible uh possibility 
so um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control and um yeah you can sell uh few uh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
mm 
uh we can just use the regular form of it but it's um not quite uh fancy 
so um 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
for uh uh for yeah yeah 
mm 
yeah we um 
is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up 
and on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting uh for for the sound 
or or isn't it 
yeah okay 
uh 
mm 
yeah but 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
see um yeah 
or we have to make a left uh for lefties and 
um 
you mean um 
yeah if 
mm no 
yeah 
um 
yeah 
it's just uh u using uh your thumb 
so um it's 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
yeah yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
so um 
do you say this um 
s uh 
uh you got like uh sort of a i believe there 
so um you want to put a display over here 
or not 
yeah 
um 
yeah 
uh we can make it um mm 
that's the top 
so uh this top 
this down 
um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um let's see 
um 
colour uh okay 
uh to make this side um like mm 
the right colour 
um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand 
so um 
uh it's an 
so so the remote control have to um lay in your hand 
so uh it's possib um yeah for s so and 
and to put uh the the buttons for um 
changing uh the channel uh over here uh 
yeah 
uh rem 
yeah but this place um 
uh it's yeah i dunno um 
yeah 
yeah so 
so 
five minutes 
yeah 
yeah 
but um the on off button um still on the top uh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
'kay 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
about the components design 
um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or a as an optional thing 
a kinetic energy like in a watch which you just shake and it produces energy 
but if we choose for that option the docking station would c become obsolete 
so i don't think it's really an option 
uh for the casing uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing single or double curved casing 
it's really up the the design that we're gonna use 
it's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions 
uh as a case supplement we could um i thought of that l later uh a rubber uh belt like a anti slip 
uh for the b buttons we can use plastic or rubber 
and the chip set um it says simple here but it should be advanced because we're using an l. c. d. uh screen 
and as uh the trend watcher presentation showed um people like wood 
but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image unless we would start two product lines 
form should follow function overall 
um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy 
but depends on what we want 
i think we should disc discuss that 
um for the case uh the supplement and the buttons it really depends on the designer 
and the chip set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control 
and that's it 
yes w there there are four options 
we could use the basic normal battery 
uh a hand dynamo 
but i don't think that's really an option 
you don't wanna swing before you can watch television 
uh solar cells 
but not every room is very light so it's not a very good option 
or the kinetic energy 
well y you basically shake your remote and then it powers up 
yeah 
yeah 
that's true 
mm i don't have any information on pricing 
so i'll have to ask the manufacturing department 
but that would also go for the l. c. d. screen then i guess 
it's a bit higher percentage but 
okay 
and that's the best choice 
well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display 
so it's gotta be advanced 
mm i dunno 
i'll have to uh research 
yes 
yes 
well the the general like most older remotes are flat just straight 
and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases 
um it would just only affect the form for as far as i know 
so it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use 
it doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality 
pick one you like yes 
yeah 
i think we should start by by choosing a case 
because that's the basis you're building on 
so i could draw them out 
let's look at the flat case 
oh 
it's from the side so it's rather normal 
the the single curved so i'm not really sure what they're gonna look like but i think it's something like this 
so this type should be better for you or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit 
and the double curved s looks something like this i guess 
so th those are the three options we have 
yeah 
it's more logical to have it on top as well because like on your mobile phone it's always above 
oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page 
okay 
okay 
good afternoon 
sure 
i'll start off then 
doh 
'kay i'm uh gonna inform you about the trend watching i've done over the past few days 
um we've done some market research 
we distributed some more enquetes questionnaires 
and um besides that um i deployed some trend watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends 
and i've consulted some additional trend watch trend watchers after the original trend watchers return about what the 
the best design would be 
um okay these are some overall findings 
um most important thing is the fancy design 
um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor 
um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design 
by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls 
um about half of half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use 
um for our um group we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old this is um these factors are slightly more equal 
'kay these are some more group specific findings 
uh the older people prefer dark colours 
uh they like recognisable shapes and familiar material 
and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much 
the material for older people 
um this is this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look and feel that um the remote should have 
um this leads us to some personal preferences 
uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the 
in the room 
um so this would mean no uh eye catching designs 
just keep it simple and well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest 
because this would be the these would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control 
so this would be very important that we at least include these features 
um well the trend watchers i consulted advised that it b should be the remote control and the docking station should be telephone shaped 
so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station 
this is not really this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people 
so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station 
so it would be kinda more telephone shaped 
um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions one with a wood like colour and maybe feel and one with a grey black colour 
the wood like for the more uh exclusive people 
people with more money 
uh the grey black colour for well 
people with less means 
that would be all 
any questions 
and how exactly does the kinetic energy work 
you just 
you use it and it works 
okay 
well personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it 
and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete 
and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um 
get great popularity for our product 
um wel 
yeah you could load up the batteries you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there 
that's true 
i'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price 
'cause in our earlier um market research if you'd allow me to go to the flat board smartboard 
um so it was open here 
um we also um 
asked if w they would if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control 
well you can see here our target group would not do that 
so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control 
i would greatly advise not to do it 
i think that would be better to uh insert in our other product that is meant for the 
younger people 
um well this is yeah but this is here the question was would you prefer it 
so that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it 
and on top of that the l. c. d. screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use 
and i think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use 
um well this was for like an l. c. d. screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones 
so pretty large 
'kay 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
well and i think most important factor there is the wooden colour 
so it wouldn't actually have to be wood if it's just 
wood coloured 
probably 
yeah that is true 
yeah 
we would have to look carefully into the design though 
'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a 
plastic cover 
the more original one or the more standard one 
so that would 
well i wouldn't design a telephone but 
well no i think w we should just we should then just design one um 
one remote but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one 
so but that shouldn't be too much of a problem 
um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat single and double curved 
could you explain that a little more 
mm-hmm 
and what would single curved and double curved mean 
okay 
so we can pretty much just do whatever we want 
'kay 
that's good 
no just to lie down 
we'll go for that 
well or besides it 
mm-hmm 
um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side so you could 
so your thumb would be easily well uh i think that was a very good point 'cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r. s. i. 
so that would be great for that 
um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side 
for left handed users also 
for the volume 
um well that could 
yeah we could do that but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy ease of use 
but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote 
'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff 
that is true 
yeah 
yeah 
that is true 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
mm-hmm 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
and i'd prefer the corners to be round 
think that would be better 
friendly on the eye 
yeah 
yeah 
very good 
so 
hello 
no problem 
okay 
that's possible on uh this time of day 
starts at three o'clock 
uh uh let me see 
our fourth and last meeting 
there he is 
yes 
okay this our last meeting 
in this meeting we will discuss our final design 
and we will do some evaluation about the not only the product but also the project 
and then we're going to close the project today as well 
so after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money 
and this uh design detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look and feel of the design 
the usability interface design and we will do the product evaluation 
um in order to do that we have this agenda 
we'll have the prototype presentation first 
then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria 
then we will look at the finance 
uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget 
because everything costs money and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost 
so we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half euro per remote 
but we will see that later 
then we will do the project uh evaluation and the closing after that 
we've got forty minutes 
so we will be finished at half past three 
but first um 
we will do the this is prototype presentation 
so if some yeah if somebody wants step forward 
okay 
okay 
uh but um i thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple 
uh just a few buttons and large buttons 
but uh i think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons 
so i'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons 
that's right 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
long time 
yeah 
if you put 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary 
okay 
yep 
okay 
so we had somebody about th interfa something about the design of the buttons there 
just n normal plain buttons 
yeah 
'kay 
no 
no 
yeah 
okay 
yep 
okay 
that's nice 
then because we only have thirty minutes left i will move on to the finance part 
which is pretty exciting to see if it's all possible what we wanna do 
and i can tell you 
that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half euros 
if we see i don't know if i've filled in correctly so just correct me if you see uh something wrong 
i counted two batteries 
but maybe we can also use one 
i don't know if it's possible 
it's rechargeable 
that's right 
okay 
that's two euros off 
we need the advanced chip 
so there's not much to uh 
to save there 
here we have the single curves 
uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one euro 
um 
i don't know but i think the single curved is good for design and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control 
i think we have to keep that 
then we have the case material supplements 
it's plastic 
it's the cheapest one we need 
so that's uh not much to save either 
but then the biggest costs are the buttons 
so maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low 
because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half euros at the end 
um 
so if we let's fir first count the buttons we have now 
because i sixteen 
nah that will be even more then 
eighteen euros 
so 
seventeen 
okay including the help 
yeah 
uh seventeen 
i think we can uh discard the help and the mute button 
uh by pressing down volume long or pressing down a a number 
long 
that saves us uh one euro already 
'cause then we have got fifteen i think 
fifteen buttons 
and this is 
no those are one i think 
yeah but th it's not stated in this files 
so maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one by pressing 
that's possibility as well 
so and it's good for the design as well 
so you can make 
uh let's see 
if you make this 
looks a bit like uh 
a cross 
plus 
min 
uh s yeah channel 
yeah w 
yeah th i think they count uh the materials 
yeah on the chip there 
yeah 
that's right 
that's right 
but i think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button 
but no but i think 
yeah 
maybe it is but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half euros 
also the l. c. display i think it's i think it's too expensive for the display we use 
i think they uh try t 
that's right but what's the big advantage of our remote then 
yeah 
no 
that's extra 
that's extra 
that's right 
that's an option 
poland 
something 
polish supplier 
don't you think we can if we can count this as v as one button 
and integrate th uh these buttons in three then we save a lot of money as well 
yeah 
that's a point 
yep 
no 
yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half euros 
we don't have any more budget to develop it 
yeah 
so 
it is 
if you leave out the l. c. display 
and if you use less buttons 
say or you can take the single chip 
there it is 
but then w 
good looking 
yeah 
i think it's uh difficult as well but 
or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers 
then w 
because then we save ten buttons 
then we have five and one 
and and see 
if we have this one and we've got the advanced 
w uh we're getting close 
then you will 
or maybe you can 
um scroll 
if you scroll you will see the numbers on the l. c. d. display 
until you've got the right number then you push it 
alright 
it's gotta scroll and push 
okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well 
yeah 
that's right 
so if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second then it g turns to that channel 
but it would definitely crop cost a lot 
and we need the battery 
and the regular chip is not possible 
it has to be advanced 
it has to be advanced 
yeah 
okay 
and we can save a euro by a flat design 
that's an option we can then we're almost there 
yeah 
so if we 
yeah but i think that's that is a big advantage if we're 
but 
can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button 
if you push it three times 
yeah 
ah that's not really that 
no 
i think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel 
if you just make it real simple 
because it saves it saves a lot of money 
and we can keep our l. c. d. screen which can provide extra information 
how to use the scroll wheel 
how to use the other bu buttons as subtitles 
and it's good for the innovative design as well 
if you would erase these 
mm eraser 
and we put uh 
looks a bit odd maybe 
that is 
something like that 
then yeah 
we've got the scroll wheel 
one two three four five buttons if we erase this one 
and these are two buttons then 
yeah 
yeah 
that's really a good good idea i think 
and it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed 
so we make one for the volume one for the channel 
plus scroll 
that's right 
so we've got one two three 
yeah we can leave the teletext in if we want 
that's m that's better 
y yeah 
mm yeah 
uh yeah and then you can 
that's right 
so we can 
decrease this one to four buttons 
yeah 
that's no problem 
yeah 
yeah 
it's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made i think 
single curved is really easy to just fill in 
and cases come right out of the machine 
and single curved you have to have a different uh different machine than a flat one 
i think this is a really easy one 
um 
what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design 
freek what do you think 
yeah 
yep 
we have to cut costs 
yeah 
yeah i'm ag 
ask for more money 
yeah 
yeah 
i am agreeing with the usability 
yeah 
yeah 
but th um i think we can then keep the single curved one 
just to express our l. c. d. screen a bit more 
so people will use it more and especially for the help functions it will be good if we have scroll bar scroll button 
it will be necessary to have good help function as well 
so this is scroll 
i think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier 
before we went on to the to the whole design 
but 
i'm glad we could make a bit 
it's pretty different if you saw the last one than this one 
yeah 
it will 
yeah 
no but i think 
i think the most 
that's right 
we can let l we can stick it out a bit 
like a old old buttons 
maybe that's recognisable for them as well 
yeah 
that's a good one 
so i'm afraid we have to move on 
and it's uh it's b uh less frightening i think 
if they see this design they think oh there are only five buttons and uh but we will see 
yeah 
that's definitely right 
yeah 
i would buy it 
that's right 
i would buy it if i was six 
no i don't know 
what it costs under twelve and a half euros 
no 
uh yes they are 
no 
but we can go on with the project evaluation 
let's see 
i can sit down i think 
we still have fifteen minutes left so we're nice on schedule 
um the project process 
evaluation criteria 
that's right 
that was the the point i forgot 
i should 
there we are 
evaluation criteria 
go ahead 
we've got five minutes i think for those criteria 
no we've got fifteen minutes but 
uh yes 
uh yeah 
okay 
yeah that's because my pen failed to upload his data 
i tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software 
i think it's fancy 
yeah 
six 
very 
subtitles buttons 
yeah 
seven 
yeah 
so we've got twenty cents for our docking station huh 
yeah 
that's right 
that's a bit dodgy 
i would say four 
four or five between 
between four or five 
yeah 
is it functional 
yes 
no 
think it's uh seven 
it was 
i had them worked out 
mm 
they are ugly not very functional and getting lost 
yeah 
no i think with our new radio button i think it's uh 
i think it's better 
i think it 
yeah 
i would give it a four 
then we have to do the three 
it's the 
yes it is 
yeah 
and they wanna put fashion in their products 
uh in the slogan of the company 
and we have the removable front cases 
so i think it's very recognisable 
yep 
we've got a calculate it 
mm 
n we've gonna we're going to evaluate it 
forty nine 
forty one 
that's 
around eighty percent 
what is it 
that's eighty four percent 
i think that's a pretty nice score 
okay 
thank you 
so 
that brings us to the project evaluation 
yep 
thank you 
project process 
did we move through the right phases you think 
along the process 
that's right 
so lack of information about prices 
okay 
uh 
okay 
satisfaction 
was there room for creativity 
no 
it's because of the finance sheet 
yeah 
the room was yeah 
restrictions 
internet access 
'kay 
leadership 
was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions 
yeah 
teamwork 
did it work out 
working together 
also you two of you with the uh last phase 
nice 
tasks 
okay 
were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do 
or were they too much 
smart board 
if it wants to download its uh data 
failed download 
smart board was irritating 
so you rather wanted to have a flip over 
or something else 
faster as well i think 
yeah 
flip over 
yeah 
uh you need a smart board uh application i think 
but i think you can yeah 
should be possible 
yeah you can export it as image 
must yeah must be 
so the sharing of the information was uh was okay 
uh network 
yeah pen is here on the table 
yeah 
it's possible 
okay 
that's nice 
have we found new ideas for 
having this kind of meetings 
or 
yeah 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
so everybody puts his own score 
and then it mediates the score and you can get one yeah 
that's better 
so that's uh 
how do we call 
evaluation 
criteria 
okay 
mm any more ideas 
or questions about the project 
or about the product 
because i think 
then that we get to our last sheet 
are the costs within the budget 
yeah 
do we 
docking station 
that's a good point 
but maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher 
uh and i think you can compensate that as well 
so i think that shouldn't be the biggest problem because it's very cheap to make as well 
do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million 
or what was it 
fifteen fifteen million 
i think we will 
if we gonna export this product 
it's innovative 
especially in america 
people are pretty decadent 
sometimes 
you can do more 
yeah 
just put it on the market for everybody 
you can you can change markets where by changing the front covers 
that's one thing you can change it with 
so you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market 
just as a test 
see how it works 
that's i think a good advantage 
yeah 
uh uh then i think we can have our little celebration right now 
that's it 
yeah 
i think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire 
i think 
i don't know 
i didn't get a message 
from the from ending of the oh i think i have one now 
five more minutes 
oh that's nice 
then we still have some questions 
if somebody has some questions they can ask them now 
or we can put these in the project folder as well 
maybe that's 
export as picture i think 
hmm 
this is another network i guess 
does somebody see the project folder 
i don't 
hmm 
my documents 
yeah i'll just put it in my documents and uh that's okay 
okay 
i think i'm going to make our final presentation now 
and then i will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation 
summary of the project 
yeah 
questionnaire 
i think you all get a questionnaire in in your room 
and then i'll meet you in i think about ten minutes or something 
okay 
thank you 
hopefully my pen will download its software 
oh 
or data 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
uh that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh so um 
you put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred 
now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons 
and you but you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel 
s so uh the shifting uh button 
uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext and shifting uh down 
so 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
uh or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh yeah 
but m yeah 
we disc discuss that already 
but uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option 
so uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh 
and uh 
oh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah it 
yeah yeah 
just to recognise it so uh 
uh yeah and now we don't need uh leds or um 
y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it 
uh so 
nay 
mm 
yeah we can u just uh 
'kay 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
yeah 
uh 
sixteen i believe so 
uh seventeen 
uh with the help button 
yeah 
yeah 
where did uh 
uh it's just one button 
but um 
yeah 
there were uh two uh for one big button 
but they are uh more expensive than the small ones 
uh yeah 
so 
it's just a 
but i don't don't know if if it's cheaper 
so uh we've still got four buttons but just um so 
you got uh not not a butt button itself but uh on the um 
yeah 
on the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons 
so 
yeah but 
are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it 
so um 
yeah 
we m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or can't uh go um 
nay 
is it impossible to 
but it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty 
i don't think so 
s 
yeah 
but you can't use uh 
yeah 
but we want to make a 
uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh yeah 
uh wi with n oh with uh 
attractive uh o options 
so uh you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty 
so 
scroll wheel's one 
no it 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
d yeah 
hmm 
ja ja 
yeah or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button 
so yeah 
yeah it's a big advantage 
but um it's 
uh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
but if you push the teletext button twice 
it's uh 
one m uh one b uh a few buttons 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
uh yeah 
but uh you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one 
just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved 
it uh it's a bit uh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
the th 
no 
but um 
but they know the scroll buttons from uh old radios 
uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels 
so maybe it's uh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
but very special so uh 
no 
mm 
yeah 
mm 
'kay 
uh six 
yeah 
mm 
sh 
yeah 
mm 
not really 
for old people i i 
w yeah 
four 
yeah 
n yeah 
no 
mm m 
yeah 
mm th yeah 
yeah 
uh 
we have to test it s but 
uh yeah true 
i go for three 
so 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
but it 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
mm 
yeah 
but 
uh 
yeah 
a flipper's uh easier so 
yeah 
but if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation 
it's easier to uh share it with uh other people 
uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet 
or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory 
so 
so yeah 
no 
t can uh can you export it uh like a yeah 
uh 
uh yeah 
so you can uh 
it's possible 
okay 
um yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh 
uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer 
uh so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
mm yeah 
mm 
yeah 
yeah 
mm 
yeah 
ah 
ah 
hmm 
where's the champagne 
uh i believe y uh 
okay 
yeah 
yeah 
uh maybe uh they will save it 
so uh 
okay 
uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire 
so uh 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
well this is what me and richard came up with 
the default spot for the on off button 
the mute button just below that 
then there's the volume and channel selectors 
simple plus minus button 
uh we thought of a help button 
if you hold it and you press another button uh the help goes to the l. c. d. screen 
then there's the zero to one to zero buttons 
a button for teletext 
a button for the subtitles 
and the company logo 
so it's rather simple prototype 
and uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it 
sure uh just pop in at any time 
i think if you look at 
most controls they've got more buttons than this 
and well the on off button it's it's a necessity 
you can't drop that one 
the volume and channel buttons you need you obviously need those those 
the mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume down button twice 
so we could cancel that one 
i think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does 
well you can't 
leave out the number buttons i guess 
and 
yeah 
so it's rather basic already 
yeah they're it's rather hard to draw on the white board 
but they're supposed to be equal sized round with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume the the triangle and stuff 
just for recognition 
so and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons 
with a a different colour than the case 
so they jump out 
and uh that's about it 
yep 
yes 
yep 
yep 
yeah 
yeah 
yes 
uh that's that's a big cost 
if we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip 
which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic 
so it's not even taken into the price 
we we could save money on it 
but would it make the remote more usable for elderly people 
my mother can't even send send an s. m. s. message 
so 
yeah 
the margin will get too small 
yeah 
ten 
no remote 
that's 
we're getting closer 
yeah 
you could just not scroll for a half a second 
so you won't need a button 
if you want to use an l. c. d. screen you you need an advanced chip yes 
yep 
yeah if you v could just leave out one more button 
yeah 
i think so 
yeah 
what if you have to scroll to page eighty eight 
eight hundred eighty eight 
yeah 
okay 
no 
we could make two buttons out of that 
and just um 
if you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll wheel 
so that would save two buttons 
if you do the same for the channel 
more obvious 
so if we 
yeah 
so 
if we leave out all those buttons perhaps you can go with the flat flat case 
and make it smaller overall 
so if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on off button the screen right behi under that than the scroll button 
you get a a much smaller remote 
and it 
sh 
yeah 
yeah 
richard's argument was very good 
yeah 
yep 
yeah 
six 
yeah 
four or five 
yes 
no 
mm we haven't thought of that one 
i think that's a three 
i still i think it's too m too fancy 
too too flashy 
twendag sieven an twendag 
yeah 
yes 
yeah 
that's true 
yeah there w there was enough room but the finance uh 
yes 
yes was okay 
the tasks are very structured so you can just do step by step and it's very easy 
well the smart board the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass but 
the digital the digital pen is very nice 
yes 
yeah 
a flip over or a more precise uh 
digit yes 
no 
didn't work 
yes 
yeah 
considering we are not going to make a docking station 
perhaps 
mm-hmm 
okay 
okay 
good afternoon 
sorry i'm a little late 
got stuck in the traffic 
yeah 
um is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality 
um when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page 
mm-hmm 
okay 
okay 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
think so 
that's what i pointed out earlier 
if you just make a control for just the t. v. there's just not much to gain here 
since it rechargeable 
um 
damn 
wouldn't yeah 
no 
that wouldn't be an option 
uh d i assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each right 
well think actually there're two buttons aren't they 
well i was thinking maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button 
that would cut the cost 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
but i think this really is four buttons anyhow 
yes 
only the docking station i guess 
maybe we should to a different supplier 
yeah 
yeah that's what i'm wondering 
um 
well since the market research 
indicated that older people spend their money easier more easy maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little 
especially since we have those nice features 
it would be a be a pretty rigid one 
or b 
basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost or just any other remote control 
but how does scroll wheel work here 
that would bring up the price of the scroll wheel also 
integrated scroll wheel push button 
but yeah 
i think that would be like the end of our usability 
yeah but 
well think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button go to page eight eight eight and teletext disappears 
but the subtitles stay there 
i think that's the case on most 
well that could be just uh like the scroll to eight click scroll to eight click scroll to eight click 
but then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people who don't even know what a scroll wheel is 
holding a 
remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero 
with only five buttons on it 
and a scroll wheel 
true 
true 
that's a pretty big scroll wheel 
so this is five buttons 
right now we have five 
mm 
well i still think we should go for the single curve design 
but then again 
all these changes are not really okay with me 
but since 
we just have to 
i'd rather just go to the board and 
get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote 
or do some market research and see what the options are 
yeah 
yes 
definitely 
yeah 
it's pretty different 
but this is not really like for the group we were making our remote 
this will really require a lot of marketing 
to get this to sell 
'cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff 
this is not familiar for them 
so we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them 
yeah 
that's true 
might uh might be confusing too 
they'd be like what 
only five buttons 
yeah 
but you're not sixty 
mm-hmm 
so um i like set up all these criteria 
and evaluation of the 
thingy 
thank you 
five more minutes 
okay 
'kay so i did some literature study study and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier 
translated it into criteria which would be these 
um is the remote fancy 
the shape look and feel 
innovative 
what new functions are there 
uh easy to use 
uh learnability is a very important factor here 
uh is it functional 
are there not too many functions uh among the functions 
and are the those functions that are there are they useful 
and the cost 
the target group 
is the remote really for the group we're making it for 
and recognability 
if our company is if it is easily recognisable that our company made it 
and 
so we're supposed to evaluate it right now 
let's see 
oh i have to say this was a little hard because the minutes of our last meeting 
were not here 
okay 
interesting 
so 
is the design fancy on a scale of one to seven 
we all go for six 
good 
um is the design innovative 
i think so with our l. c. d. screen docking station scroll buttons 
seven 
should be do able 
is the design easy to use 
well 
would be for us 
but 
i'd go for four too 
is the design functional 
um do we have all functions that we want to include 
i think we do 
do we have too many functions 
i don't think so 
it's pretty slim 
seven 
oh and do we um 
take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control 
like it getting lost and 
r. s. i. influences 
think we do 
are the production costs within the preset limits 
well they are now 
does the design fit the group of focus 
yeah 
i think it doesn't 
i don't know 
i think 
i think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control 
i'm not sure 
i think i'd go for two 
'kay 
is the company company recognisable 
well we have the logo there 
so 
yeah 
so that will be this 
i was also supposed to calculate the score but 
thought we would have another private thingy after this 
is this like after this are we done 
or 
we're gonna go to our other room again 
well anyhow 
these are seven factors times seven is forty 
something 
two 
no 
nine 
uh minus one 
minus three minus four 
minus four 
so that would be minus eight 
forty one out of forty nine 
okay 
guess i'll just type that in on the bottom here 
hmm 
'kay 
so that will be the evaluation 
think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier 
in the design phase 
yeah 
definitely 
no 
not too much 
no 
yeah true 
but 
and i would've liked to go for the 
younger users also 
and just to be able to access internet and 
get something of your own 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i tried to open the file on my laptop but 
not possible 
yeah 
no 
should've done that then 
pen is here 
mm 
yeah 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
they are 
yeah 
fifty grand 
yeah 
yeah still i think i mean if we're n gonna make a scroll button anyway 
it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people 
so maybe we should just re focus 
or specifically for younger people 
that's true 
yeah i think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is than would be with 
older people 
even if it were their covers 
but 
party party 
'kay 
oh you did 
mm-hmm 
yeah 
yeah it probably will 
oh yeah you're supposed to make a final 
are we supposed to go into our own rooms again 
yeah 
yeah 
that'd be nice
